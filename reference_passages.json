{"gpt2.txt": "In Aldous Huxley's novel \"Brave New World,\" Mustapha Mond is portrayed as a powerful and mysterious figure. The novel depicts a dystopian society in which the government, led by Mond, maintains strict control over its citizens through the use of advanced technology and manipulation of emotions. Despite this, I argue that Mond should be viewed positively for three key reasons: his efforts to maintain stability in society, his recognition of the limitations of happiness, and his belief in individual freedom.\n\nFirstly, Mond's role as World Controller is to maintain stability in society. He recognizes that in order for society to function, there must be a balance between individual desires and the needs of the community. He also understands that in order to maintain this balance, it is necessary to control certain aspects of society, such as the use of technology and the manipulation of emotions. This is evident in his decision to ban literature, which he believes will cause dissent and disrupt the stability of society. In this way, Mond can be seen as a pragmatic leader who is willing to make difficult decisions for the greater good.\n\nSecondly, Mond recognizes the limitations of happiness. In the novel, the government encourages the citizens to pursue pleasure and happiness at all times, but Mond understands that this is not a sustainable or fulfilling way of life. He acknowledges that true happiness cannot be found through constant pleasure and that individuals need to find meaning and purpose in their lives. This is evident in his statement, \"ending is better than mending. The more stitches, the less riches.\" This quote shows that Mond recognizes that true happiness cannot be found in constant pleasure, but rather in finding meaning in one's life.\n\nLastly, Mond believes in individual freedom. Despite his role in controlling society, he recognizes that individuals have the right to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit. This is evident in his decision to provide a reservation for those who do not want to conform to the rules of society. This shows that Mond understands that individuals should have the freedom to live their lives as they choose, even if it means going against the norms of society.\n\nIn conclusion, Mustapha Mond, the World Controller in Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" should be viewed positively for his efforts to maintain stability in society, his recognition of the limitations of happiness and his belief in individual freedom. Although his methods are controversial, they are necessary to maintain the balance of society. His recognition of the limitations of happiness and his belief in individual freedom also show that he is a nuanced and thoughtful leader who understands the complexity of human nature.", "spanish.txt": "Hechas, pues, estas prevenciones, no quiso aguardar m\u00e1s tiempo a poner en efeto su pensamiento, apret\u00e1ndole a ello la falta que \u00e9l pensaba que hac\u00eda en el mundo su tardanza, seg\u00fan eran los agravios que pensaba deshacer, tuertos que enderezar, sinrazones que emendar, y abusos que mejorar y deudas que satisfacer. Y as\u00ed, sin dar parte a persona alguna de su intenci\u00f3n, y sin que nadie le viese, una ma\u00f1ana, antes del d\u00eda, que era uno de los calurosos del mes de julio, se arm\u00f3 de todas sus armas, subi\u00f3 sobre Rocinante, puesta su mal compuesta celada, embraz\u00f3 su adarga, tom\u00f3 su lanza, y, por la puerta falsa de un corral, sali\u00f3 al campo con grand\u00edsimo contento y alborozo de ver con cu\u00e1nta facilidad hab\u00eda dado principio a su buen deseo. Mas, apenas se vio en el campo, cuando le asalt\u00f3 un pensamiento terrible, y tal, que por poco le hiciera dejar la comenzada empresa; y fue que le vino a la memoria que no era armado caballero, y que, conforme a ley de caballer\u00eda, ni pod\u00eda ni deb\u00eda tomar armas con ning\u00fan caballero; y, puesto que lo fuera, hab\u00eda de llevar armas blancas, como novel caballero, sin empresa en el escudo, hasta que por su esfuerzo la ganase. Estos pensamientos le hicieron titubear en su prop\u00f3sito; mas, pudiendo m\u00e1s su locura que otra raz\u00f3n alguna, propuso de hacerse armar caballero del primero que topase, a imitaci\u00f3n de otros muchos que as\u00ed lo hicieron, seg\u00fan \u00e9l hab\u00eda le\u00eddo en los libros que tal le ten\u00edan. En lo de las armas blancas, pensaba limpiarlas de manera, en teniendo lugar, que lo fuesen m\u00e1s que un armi\u00f1o; y con esto se quiet\u00f3 y prosigui\u00f3 su camino, sin llevar otro que aquel que su caballo quer\u00eda, creyendo que en aquello consist\u00eda la fuerza de las aventuras.\n\nYendo, pues, caminando nuestro flamante aventurero, iba hablando consigo mesmo y diciendo:\n\n\u2014 \u00bfQui\u00e9n duda sino que en los venideros tiempos, cuando salga a luz la verdadera historia de mis famosos hechos, que el sabio que los escribiere no ponga, cuando llegue a contar esta mi primera salidad tan de ma\u00f1ana, desta manera?: \u00abApenas hab\u00eda el rubicundo Apolo tendido por la faz de la ancha y espaciosa tierra las doradas hebras de sus hermosos cabellos, y apenas los peque\u00f1os y pintados pajarillos con sus arpadas lenguas hab\u00edan saludado con dulce y meliflua armon\u00eda la venida de la rosada aurora, que, dejando la blanda cama del celoso marido, por las puertas y balcones del manchego horizonte a los mortales se mostraba, cuando el famoso caballero don Quijote de la Mancha, dejando las ociosas plumas, subi\u00f3 sobre su famoso caballo Rocinante, y comenz\u00f3 a caminar por el antiguo y conocido campo de Montiel\u00bb.\n", "human.txt": "All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, \u201cOh, why can\u2019t you remain like this for ever!\u201d This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.\n\nOf course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one. She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.\n\nThe way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door.\n\nMr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him.\n"}
