In Aldous Huxley's novel "Brave New World," Mustapha Mond is portrayed as a powerful and mysterious figure. The novel depicts a dystopian society in which the government, led by Mond, maintains strict control over its citizens through the use of advanced technology and manipulation of emotions. Despite this, I argue that Mond should be viewed positively for three key reasons: his efforts to maintain stability in society, his recognition of the limitations of happiness, and his belief in individual freedom.

Firstly, Mond's role as World Controller is to maintain stability in society. He recognizes that in order for society to function, there must be a balance between individual desires and the needs of the community. He also understands that in order to maintain this balance, it is necessary to control certain aspects of society, such as the use of technology and the manipulation of emotions. This is evident in his decision to ban literature, which he believes will cause dissent and disrupt the stability of society. In this way, Mond can be seen as a pragmatic leader who is willing to make difficult decisions for the greater good.

Secondly, Mond recognizes the limitations of happiness. In the novel, the government encourages the citizens to pursue pleasure and happiness at all times, but Mond understands that this is not a sustainable or fulfilling way of life. He acknowledges that true happiness cannot be found through constant pleasure and that individuals need to find meaning and purpose in their lives. This is evident in his statement, "ending is better than mending. The more stitches, the less riches." This quote shows that Mond recognizes that true happiness cannot be found in constant pleasure, but rather in finding meaning in one's life.

Lastly, Mond believes in individual freedom. Despite his role in controlling society, he recognizes that individuals have the right to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit. This is evident in his decision to provide a reservation for those who do not want to conform to the rules of society. This shows that Mond understands that individuals should have the freedom to live their lives as they choose, even if it means going against the norms of society.

In conclusion, Mustapha Mond, the World Controller in Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," should be viewed positively for his efforts to maintain stability in society, his recognition of the limitations of happiness and his belief in individual freedom. Although his methods are controversial, they are necessary to maintain the balance of society. His recognition of the limitations of happiness and his belief in individual freedom also show that he is a nuanced and thoughtful leader who understands the complexity of human nature.
