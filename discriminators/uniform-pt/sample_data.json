{"original": ["It would be the first increase since the rate was cut to near zero during the 2008 financial crisis. However, the bank said conditions in the labour market and inflation did not yet warrant an increase. In a press conference the Fed chair Janet Yellen said that \"most [policy-makers] are anticipating a rate increase this year\". She added that once rates started to rise, any increases would be gradual. The US central bank is trying to find a balance between giving clear guidance to the markets about what will prompt a rise, while not restricting its freedom to react to new economic data. The bank said it would raise rates when it had \"seen further improvement in the labour market\" and was \"reasonably confident\" that inflation would reach its target of 2% in the \"medium term\". Many economists expect the first rate rise to come in September, though the projections released by the Fed today show less certainty about how far rates will rise before the end of this year. Policy makers are equally split between one, two or three rate increases this year, according to the bank's \"dot plot\", which shows where individual policy makers think the economy is heading. Ms Yellen said that \"sometimes too much attention\" was placed on the timing of the first increase - and that the entire trajectory should be considered. \"It seems likely that some cyclical weakness in the labour market remains,\" she continued, \"although progress clearly has been achieved, room for further improvement remains\". The jobless rate is currently at 5.5%, close to where the policy makers said it needed to be to consider raising rates. But it is thought that this number does not reflect the full picture with many people not being counted because they are not looking for work, but would still like a job. Ms Yellen said that, although the Federal Reserve saw the factors behind the disappointing first quarter as transitory, they \"would like to see more decisive evidence that a moderate economic growth will be sustained\". \"In the grand scheme things doesn't mark a big shift in their thinking,\" said Charles Seville, North America director at the ratings firm Fitch. \"They're sticking to their script. We expect a rate rise in September.\" Mr Seville added that the emphasis on the slow and gradual", "The proposals are specifically aimed at reducing the high rates of teenage smokers in France. Health Minister Marisol Touraine plans to follow Australia's example, which introduced similar measures in 2012. Experts say removing branding on packets and adding large health warnings reduced smoking in Australia. However, some tobacco companies dispute the evidence for this and say France's plans are incomprehensible. Smoking is the main cause of death in France, with more than 70,000 people dying each year of tobacco-related illnesses. The new measures, which will come into effect once the law goes through the National Assembly, also includes a ban on smoking in children's play areas in public parks and in cars carrying children under 12. In addition, advertising of e-cigarettes will be restricted before being banned in May 2016, except at the point of sale and in trade publications. Ms Touraine says there are 13 million smokers in France - which has a population of around 66 million - and the \"number of smokers is growing, especially among young people.\" \"We can't accept that tobacco kills 73,000 people every year in our country - the equivalent of a plane crash every day with 200 people on board,\" she added. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the move goes well beyond what France is required to do under European anti-smoking rules. EU laws already force tobacco firms to cover 65% of the packaging with health warnings, but Ms Touraine said they would be \"the same shape, same size, same colour, same typeset\" if the ban came into effect. Celine Audibert, a spokeswoman for French firm Seita, which is a subsidiary of Imperial Tobacco, described the move as \"completely incomprehensible\". \"It's based on the Australian experience which, more than a failure, was a complete fiasco,\" added Ms Audibert. In 2012, Australia forced all cigarettes to be sold in identical brown packets, largely covered with graphic health warnings. Tobacco clearances, an indicator of tobacco volumes in the Australian market, fell 3.4% in 2013 compared with 2012. But Australia also raised cigarette taxes that led to consumer prices increasing, creating doubt over which move made the most difference.", "The Pew Research Center, which looks at social issues, found that belief in capital punishment was at its lowest for over four decades. Only about half of Americans (49%) now favour execution for inmates convicted of murder, while 42% oppose it. Support has dropped by 7% since March 2015, from 56%. There has been a sizeable slump in public approval for state executions, which peaked during the mid-1990s. In 1994, eight out of 10 Americans backed the death penalty, and under two in 10 were opposed to it. Support for death penalty below 50% in UK Do murder 'masterminds' deserve death? Statistics behind US violence According to the Pew's findings, opposition to the death penalty is at its highest since 1972. Previous Gallup polls have shown that support fell as low as 42% in 1966, but then rose gradually to hit 80% in 1994. Since then, it has been gradually declining across almost all demographics. Pew found that people who identified as Republican were more likely to agree with capital punishment for convicted murderers (72%), while 34% of Democrats shared that view. Men were more likely to say they favoured the death penalty, at 55%, while 38% oppose it - but for women the number for and against was almost equal - 43% for, and 45% against. A 57% majority of white people favour the death penalty for murderers (down from 63% last year). But Black and Hispanic people support it at much lower rates, at 29% and 36% respectively. Being younger and spending longer in formal education also made respondents less likely to support execution. Among those aged 18 to 29, the level was 42% in favour, compared to 51% of those 30 and older. Among Americans with at least a college degree, 43% backed the death penalty, while that rose to 51% for those without a degree. The researchers surveyed 1,201 adults between 23 August and 23 September, 2016. The prevailing trend mimics the shift seen across the Atlantic. In Britain, support for the death penalty dropped below 50% for the first time in 2015, according to the NatCen British Social Attitudes Report. The survey found 48% were in favour of capital punishment, which was abolished in the UK in the 1960s.", "Seth Bling, from Seattle, described his project online in a video. The ones and zeroes used by computers as the basis for all programming are represented by alternating blocks - either dirt or stone. However, the emulator is too slow to actually be playable - a single game could take months. Mr Bling's console comprises a giant screen, which gradually updates as the game animates, and a huge field of blocks that form the virtual console's memory. He has also designed game cartridges for Donkey Kong, Space Invaders and Pac Man - in the form of huge Minecraft blocks that are scanned as though being read by the original hardware. Two thousand command blocks - which can perform operations on other blocks - form the system's processor. They manipulate blocks in the memory just like a physical processor operates on data in a computer. But the processor works very slowly, drawing frames to the screen 60 times every four hours. The original console ran at 60 frames per second. \"Because of the structures that exist within Minecraft [...] you could, weirdly, in an Inception-like way, build a Minecraft within Minecraft,\" said Tom Crick, professor of computer science and public policy at Cardiff Metropolitan University, referring to the film. The possibilities, he added, were more or less boundless. \"You could very easily construct a modern Intel or ARM microprocessor - it would be very slow but it would be functionally correct and complete,\" he told the BBC. He pointed out that, in the physical world, Lego also allows people to build all kinds of mechanical devices on a large scale. The game's developer, Mojang, released an educational edition of the game earlier this year and parent company Microsoft recently unveiled a one-hour online tutorial, built entirely in Minecraft, that teaches students to code. But last month, the UK government's \"behaviour czar\" Tom Bennett told The Times newspaper he was \"not a fan\" of Minecraft in lessons. \"This smacks to me of another gimmick which will get in the way of children actually learning,\" he said. Prof Crick said Minecraft was not a magical tool that solves educational problems, but added, \"The fact you can create essentially anything is a very powerful thing.\"", "Ivy Atkin, 86, died of pneumonia in November 2012 after being transferred from Autumn Grange home in Nottingham. Owner Yousaf Khan was jailed for three years two months in February after admitting corporate manslaughter. The inspection came after a whistleblower alerted the city council's safeguarding team. Mrs Atkin weighed under four stone (25kg or 3st 13lbs) when she died. More updates on Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspector Lesley White told the inquest that residents were \"sat in dirty clothes, in their own urine\". The home, on Sherwood Rise, was full of \"chaos and screaming\" during her inspection, she said. Under questioning from Nottinghamshire Assistant Coroner Stephanie Haskey, Mrs White said she had not \"missed anything\" in an earlier inspection in September. \"A home can go downhill quickly,\" she told the inquest at Nottingham Council House. The care home had a history of care plan failings and had already been inspected by the CQC and other agencies, the inquest was told. In February 2012, the home had a warning about infection control and cleanliness. Six months later, a staff member said there was no Criminal Records Bureau check on her while she worked there. Then in October, there was a fight between two residents where one was injured and taken to hospital. Also two night staff were dismissed. Relatives of other residents said the home tried to side step their concerns, the inquest heard. Khan, 47, of Nelson Road, Nottingham, was jailed and his firm Sherwood Rise Ltd, was fined \u00c2\u00a3300,000 for corporate manslaughter - the first case of its kind in England. The inquest heard Mrs Atkin died from pneumonia as a result of debilitation and low body mass index (BMI), contributed to by dementia. Her BMI was just 10.7, while the healthy weight range is between 18.5 and 24.9. CQC inspectors found the care home did not meet any of their required standards including safeguarding service users from abuse, meeting nutritional needs, cleanliness and infection control. Mrs Atkin and the other residents were moved out on 4 November, but she died on 22 November. The inquest continues.", "The US central bank said it had unanimously agreed to keep rates at close to zero this month, but believed the economy was on a stronger footing. \"Economic activity has been expanding moderately in recent months,\" it said in a statement. But it still did not give a clear indication of when rates would rise. In its statement, the Fed noted that the job market, housing and consumer spending had all improved. The central bank's policy makers also said they expected inflation to rise gradually toward its 2% target. On employment - which is now at a seven-year low of 5.3% - the bank said job gains had been \"solid\", more positive language than last month. But it again reiterated that it would only hike its benchmark interest rate \"when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective\". The Fed's decision to keep its main interest rate on hold this month had been widely expected. \"The bottom line is they didn't do a lot. \"But they've nudged the market in the direction of a 2015 rate hike. And it's increased our confidence in a September rate hike,\" Millan Mulraine, deputy head of US strategy at TD Securities told the BBC. Barclays economist Michael Gapen said that he also still expected a rate rise in September, which he said remained the bank's \"baseline forecast\" And Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds, said the statement confirmed the Fed was \"taking baby steps\" towards an increase. The interest rate has now been at a record low for six and a half years. The US central bank's decision to cut the rate to such a low level in December 2008 was aimed at boosting growth in the economy amid the global financial crisis. Most analysts expect the first hike in September, but Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has emphasised that any increase will be determined by the latest economic data. She has also said that when rates do begin to rise, the increase will only be gradual. US stock markets, which were up ahead of the Fed's decision, continued to trade higher after the decision.", "Baby and adult ashes were mixed together at the crematorium and given back to relatives of the adult. The parents of infants were told there were no ashes. Aberdeen City Council's insurers are already dealing with claims, and a deadline for any more has been set for 1 February. BBC Scotland revealed in 2013 that no ashes had been offered to the families of infants cremated in Aberdeen over a five-year period. It followed similar revelations about Mortonhall crematorium in Edinburgh, which had been secretly burying baby ashes for decades. A report into the scandal by Dame Elish Angiolini described the practices as \"abhorrent\". Patrick McGuire, a partner with Thompsons Solicitors - the firm representing many of the families involved - said: \"The past few years have been immensely painful and stressful for the Aberdeen families. \"They have struggled to get their concerns heard. They felt as if their concerns were being ignored and brushed aside. \"The fact that we are where we are today is a testament to their courage, tenacity and dignity as well as the knowledge that in the end they knew they would be proved right. \"Over the past few years myself and the Aberdeen parents have had no alternative other than to follow a course of being highly critical of the stance adopted by Aberdeen City Council. The council has now done the right thing and for that they should be given credit. \"Myself and the families also believe that the report produced by Dame Elish Angiolini into these terrible events was critical in bringing us to this point and we wish to extend our thanks to her.\" A spokesperson for Aberdeen City Council said: \"We are committed to moving towards a settlement of claims for compensation and are working with all parties to ensure the individuals and families involved in the process are kept fully informed throughout the process. \"The council has wholeheartedly apologised for the distress past practices at Aberdeen Crematorium have caused. The commitment to the compensation process is part of a full and comprehensive response from the organisation but Aberdeen City Council is clear that the impact on those affected must never be forgotten.\" The terms of compensation packages will remain confidential.", "Towell, 25, died in hospital on 30 September, the day after his bout with Welshman Evans in Glasgow. Almost six months on, Evans has revealed a meeting with Towell's mother gave him the strength to carry on. \"I did not want to be seen. I did not even feel like going out,\" he told Jason Mohammad on BBC Radio Wales. Evans, 25, has returned to training and hopes to fight again in May, but initially struggled to come to terms with what happened. He said all he was worried about was Towell's family, including partner Chloe and son Rocco. \"I was just in the house, in my bedroom, I was struggling to eat,\" he said. \"My heart was broken by what happened that night and I cried for days and days. \"I was low, but it was not about me. I didn't want it to be about me, that's why I couldn't go out.\" Towell was knocked down twice by Evans before the referee stopped their fight. And Evans said a meeting with his opponent's mother Tracey at the Scot's funeral was a turning point for him. \"It was frightening,\" he said. \"I didn't know what reception I would get. \"I was so glad I went because the reception I got, not only from his family, but friends of Mike and the Scottish people in general was so supportive. \"I came out of the chapel and walked down the steps and a car pulled up and Mike's mum got out. She gave me a big hug and a kiss and she said: 'Stop being silly.' \"I admire the strength of that woman.\" Evans was due to fight for the Welsh welterweight title last weekend, but had to pull out with an elbow injury. He is now hoping to return to the ring in May, and wants to fight for the British title as the mandatory challenger. Evans wants to win that belt not just for himself, but for Towell too, and his family. \"They asked that when I fight for the British title they can purchase tickets off me and come and support me,\" he said. \"I think that is fantastic. Now, when I go to fight, it won't only be for me, it will be for Mike too.\"", "Prof Graham Donaldson wants computer programming and IT in all classes to be as important as literacy and numeracy. Schools should have more flexibility to teach around a central curriculum. The results of the independent review have been called \"a compelling, exciting and ambitious vision\" by the education minister. Prof Donaldson - a former chief inspector of schools appointed last March to look at what is taught in Wales - suggests: Analysis: Curriculum change in Wales 'Positive, profound and patient' proposals Read a copy of the full report The Successful Futures report has taken nearly a year to compile and Prof Donaldson said he had received a \"clear and consistent\" message after taking evidence from more than 700 people, from pupils and parents to teachers and business. The former schools inspector was commissioned by Education Minister Huw Lewis to undertake a comprehensive and wide-ranging review of the national curriculum and testing. Mr Lewis said: \"The scope and scale of the changes he envisages are both fundamental and wide ranging and will take time to create and secure\". Prof Donaldson said the proposed changes were about better learning and higher standards. \"Better learning because it draws on evidence from Wales and beyond to focus on what really matters in a modern school curriculum,\" he said. \"Higher standards because it sets high expectations for learning and provides ways in which schools and teachers can help young people to meet, and often exceed, those expectations.\" Chris Keates, general secretary of the NAS/UWT union said the report would be considered carefully. \"We broadly welcome the thrust of the review which has the potential to make a positive difference for learners, teachers and the wider workforce in Wales. \"The emphasis on ensuring that teachers are given sufficient autonomy in the classroom to make decisions about teaching and learning is particularly welcome.\" David Evans of the NUT praised how the review had been conducted, adding: \"It is absolutely critical now that what Prof Donaldson has set in motion is implemented fully in conjunction with the profession\". The Welsh government said it would launch a \"great debate'\" on the curriculum shortly.", "The investment is backed by nearly \u00a315m from the Welsh government with production due to start in late 2018. Economy Minister Edwina Hart said the deal would \"safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years\". \"In a climate of stiff global competitiveness, we have been actively seeking to win a share of this investment for Wales,\" she said. \"Ford's decision to manufacture its new innovative engine here in Wales is a tribute to the reputation of the local management team and the quality and loyalty of the Welsh workforce,\" she added. The Ford Bridgend plant opened in 1980 and has fought fierce competition to win successive investments in the past worth more than \u00a32.8bn. The company has said its presence supports around 10,000 jobs in south Wales, with 1,860 employed at the plant itself. Ford said technicians based in Essex and Germany had worked together on the design and development of a new fuel-efficient range of engines. A letter from Ford to workers seen by the BBC in June said that to win the investment there would need to be a change to working conditions at Bridgend to make the plant more competitive. Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister William Graham said Friday's announcement was a sign of \"confidence in the UK government's efforts to rebuild the economy\". This is good news for workers at Bridgend as the new production will begin in 2018, just as the manufacturing of Jaguar Land Rover engines at the site will be coming to an end. It secured hundreds of jobs that may otherwise have been in jeopardy. Two hundred fixed contract workers were let go at Ford Bridgend this year when it stopped manufacturing engines for Volvo. There are concerns, though, that the new investment will mean that Bridgend can only manufacture a third of the number of engines it does at the moment. Some question why the Welsh government should be contributing \u00a315m to the investment of a multinational company in a plant it owns. Bridgend was in competition with three other European Ford plants for this work, all with governments offering financial support as standard. The automotive industry is so competitive internationally that without government backing, companies are likely to go elsewhere.", "The move to western Aleppo came after troops retook Hanano district, the largest controlled by the rebels. The capture of Hanano gives the army an advantage in its drive to seize other opposition-held areas. Some 275,000 people are under siege as the army's offensive - now in its 13th day - is intensified. The assault has killed 219 civilians, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says. Among the victims were 27 children, the monitoring group added. Reports suggest there is a lack of medical supplies and food. Meanwhile, rebels have intensified rocket attacks on the government-controlled western districts of Aleppo. Their attacks have killed 27 civilians since the offensive began, the Observatory said, including 11 children. The Syrian army's success in Hanano is its biggest of the offensive against the rebels. Retaking all of Aleppo would be a major victory for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after five years of conflict. Hanano was the first neighbourhood in Aleppo taken by rebels in 2012. Syrian forces regained the district on Saturday - a move making it easier for them to isolate the northern districts of east Aleppo from the southern ones. Air strikes launched as part of the recent government offensive were described by activists as the most intense ever, leaving the streets deserted. As the army advance neared, the Observatory said more than 400 residents had left the eastern districts of Haidaria and al-Shaar, where they were received by the army and taken to areas under their control in the west of the city. Al-Jazeera says others are moving out of the besieged neighbourhoods of Hulluk, Sheikh Fares and Sakhour. Civilians in eastern Aleppo had until now rejected several government ultimatums to leave and the latest development is important, says the BBC's Sebastian Usher. Aleppo, once Syria's commercial and industrial hub, has been divided roughly in two since 2012, with the government controlling the west and rebels the east. In the past year, Syrian troops have broken the deadlock with the help of Iranian-backed militias and Russian air strikes. Russia says its air force is active in other parts of the country, but not operating over Aleppo.", "The club's new owners have brought in a \u00c2\u00a3100,000 debenture for existing members and a doubled annual fee of \u00c2\u00a316,000. Residents on the estate - where houses cost millions - have threatened to block roads during the PGA contest but the club said they were \"not the type\". PGA organisers said any impact on May's event would be \"extremely unfortunate\". The Beijing-based Reignwood Group, which bought Wentworth golf club in 2014, unveiled a new membership structure last year. But Eric Leon, from Wentworth Residents Association, said local people - who own the estate's private roads and verges - had been \"kicked out\". He said many residents were not multi-millionaires and could not afford the new fees, which are due to come in to force in 2017. \"We can, in practice, make it very difficult to hold an event like the PGA,\" he said. \"There are obviously a lot of people who are prepared to block the road if required,\" he added. A spokeswoman for the club said it was disappointing to hear of the threat to block roads, but if there was a \"serious threat of this nature\" the estate would make the club aware. She said Wentworth residents had respected the PGA championship for 44 years and there had never been any disruption before. \"I don't think the estate residents are the type of people who would be prepared to block roads during such a celebrated event,\" she added. She said the Wentworth club had been confirmed as the host venue of the championship - one of the UK's biggest golf tournaments - until 2018 and was also working on collaborating with the European Tour beyond that date. A spokesman for the European Tour, which organises the PGA Championship and is based at Wentworth, next", "The Stormont administration is facing a multi-million pound shortfall due to the continuing failure to implement welfare reforms. The DUP is to table a 'fantasy' budget to executive colleagues later this week in a bid to break the deadlock. Theresa Villiers said agreement would buy more time to resolve the crisis. It is estimated Northern Ireland will lose out on around \u00c2\u00a3600m this year if welfare reforms are not introduced. Ms Villiers, who met business leaders in Belfast to discuss the economic impact of the crisis, said a provisional budget was better than no budget at all. \"Failing to agree a budget of any kind would mean we face those emergency budget measures which could detrimentally start to impact on public services. \"I think agreeing a budget on a provisional basis would be helpful,\" she said. \"It at least gives a little bit more time to see these matters resolved.\" The DUP are proposing the 'fantasy' budget in an effort to clear an imminent legislative requirement to sign off on an agreed spending plan for the rest of the year. Sinn Fein has not ruled out backing the plan, which will be based on the assumption that the Stormont House Agreement has actually been implemented. Currently, the executive would not have the money to see through many of the funding commitments in the provisional budget. However, funds could become available if the welfare reform dispute is resolved. The failure to agree has left the executive facing a funding gap of hundreds of millions of pounds this financial year. The defeat of the Welfare Reform Bill in the Assembly last month, due to a Sinn Fein/SDLP veto, has endangered other political and economic developments. These include the devolution of corporation tax powers, access to \u00c2\u00a32bn of increased borrowing powers from the treasury, a major civil service redundancy scheme and new structures to address the legacy of the Troubles. If executive ministers fail to set a budget for the second half of the financial year, then a senior civil servant will be forced to take over departmental purse strings at the end of July.", "The research reported lower sales and turnover, with poorer profit growth. Those taking part in the study expected turnover to increase by only 1% in the next 12 months. The business monitor is conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) and Grant Thornton UK. It found year-on-year profit growth has fallen from 6% in the second quarter of 2014, to 3.3% in the latest figures. There has been a similar trend in sales volumes and turnover, with export growth being especially hard hit. ICAEW Scotland President Andrew Hewett said: \"It is disappointing to once again see a drop in confidence amongst Scottish businesses, particularly when it takes us into negative territory. \"This is part of an ongoing decline in confidence in Scotland, which can perhaps be attributed to ongoing uncertainty. \"The aftermath of the referendum, the run up to the general election, the forthcoming Holyrood elections and the possibility of an EU referendum combine to mean that there is, potentially, an even deeper degree of uncertainty in Scotland than there is elsewhere in the UK, a feeling which is reflected in Scottish confidence levels.\" The research found companies were scaling back on recruitment plans. The number of employees was reported to have increased by 0.7% over the past 12 months. The UK figure for the same period was 2.2%. Companies in Scotland expected their workforce headcount to increase by just 0.3% over the next year. The monitor pointed out that, with Scotland's greater dependence on the public sector, UK government plans to cut spending will combine with a slowing of private sector job creation to \"impact dramatically\" on the Scottish labour market. Grant Thornton UK managing partner in Scotland Kevin Engel said: \"This significant drop in confidence north of the border is naturally concerning, particularly given Scotland is the only part of the UK showing such a marked negative trend. \"The quarter examined covers the pre-election period, which could go some way to explain the downward shift in confidence. \"However the Scottish business community is historically resilient. Now is the time for that tenacity in the face of challenging conditions to come to the fore to resist the potential dip in economic performance that may follow.\"", "The comment comes after the Welsh Government said deaths had stabilised following a significant rise towards the end of the last decade. There were 463 deaths in 2015 and 504 in 2012, while all liver disease deaths were up 19.4% over the last five years. But substance misuse charity Cais said there are still many older people who had drinking problems. \"I think we need to take cautious optimism from these figures,\" said Clive Wolfendale, the charity's chief executive. \"Deaths remain far too high. We still have decades of ill-health long stowed up in our population. \"There's certainly a culture of drinking to excess among the older generation and it's going to take some decades to play out. \"There are signs that alcohol consumption among teenagers are on the decline but, in some cases, they are turning to new psycho-active substances.\" Mr Wolfendale added he was pleased to hear plans to introduce a new law setting a minimum price for alcohol in Wales could be revived by the Welsh Government. Under the plans, the cost of alcohol would be determined by a formula based on its strength and volume. However, the proposal depends on the result of a Supreme Court challenge against similar plans by the Scottish Government. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Government's annual report on liver disease shows there is still more work to be done. As well as alcohol, obesity and blood borne viral hepatitis C are the other most preventable causes of liver disease. \"In Wales, we want to reduce the number of people getting and dying from liver disease,\" he said. \"We want to ensure people - whatever their age - value good liver health, and are aware of the dangers of excess alcohol, obesity and blood borne viral hepatitis. \"We want everyone to take personal responsibility for their lifestyle choices and reduce the risk of acquiring preventable liver disease.\" He said during 2015-16 there had been \"continued progress in the care of patients with liver disease in Wales\". \"We've seen a reduction in the number of alcohol-related deaths over recent years, but we know there's much more to do,\" he added. \"Services are improving throughout Wales, despite dealing with complex demand. \"The service needs to continue to undergo change if it is to cope with patients and their needs.\"", "Many of the whales died overnight at Farewell Spit at the top of the South Island, but those that survived are now swimming in the bay off the beach. Hundreds of locals managed to rescue the survivors after forming a human chain to refloat the whales. The incident is one of the worst such cases the country has seen. On Friday, a number of the whales that had been refloated returned to the beach overnight, but high tide and the arrival of a new pod of pilot whales on Saturday morning improved rescue efforts. \"Fingers crossed, the new whales are going to lead them out into deeper water,\" said Andrew Lamason, the department of conservation's regional manager. However, he added that there was still a chance that they might turn back into Golden Bay. Mr Lamason said improved weather and clear waters also helped with the latest rescue attempt, but added that he had to warn volunteers about the possibility of stingrays and sharks after one of the dead whales appeared to have bite marks. Officials on Saturday were also considering how best to dispose of the whale carcasses. Mr Lamason said that simply towing them out to sea could be problematic as they may become gaseous and buoyant and float into populated bays. Scientists do not know what exactly causes whales to beach themselves. But it sometimes happens because the whales are old and sick, injured, or make navigational errors particularly along gentle sloping beaches. Whales that become beached will send out distress signals attracting other members of their pod, who then also get stranded by a receding tide. The latest incident in New Zealand was first reported on Thursday evening, but conditions were too dangerous at the time to launch a rescue operation. The surviving whales were kept alive after", "Cathro, who took charge in December, has come under pressure after his side slipped to fifth in the table. Goncalves worked under the 30-year-old at Rio Ave, where Cathro was assistant manager, in Portugal. \"I know how he works and, if you give him time, you will see amazing things here,\" he said. \"Inside of me, I am sure next season you will see what Ian is really capable of doing. Hearts owner Ann Budge issued a statement on Thursday in which she stressed that Cathro was in charge of picking the team amid speculation about the role of former manager and present director of football Craig Levein. Goncalves, who was signed by Cathro from Anorthosis Famagusta in January, insists that the Hearts players have confidence in the head coach. \"You can see there's a lot of pressure on him, but he has a plan he must follow to the end and must not change because we lost two or three games,\" said the 25-year-old striker. \"All the players trust him that his plan is going to work because we see in training what he is saying and what we do is clear and everybody is understanding what is his plan. \"I think every players trusts him and has confidence in him.\" Hearts are five points behind fourth-placed St Johnstone and in danger of missing out on a Europa League qualifying place. Cathro has suggested that, while he is aiming to qualify, his side might not be quite ready to compete at that level. However, Goncalves believes it is hugely important that they qualify - even if it means a shorter summer break. \"With the plan the club have, it is important that we go to the Europa League,\" he said. \"Even if we had a holiday of six days or five days, I would be happy to have a holiday of a few days to play in the Europa League, or even not have holidays.\" Hearts beat Dundee 1-0 on Saturday to end a run of three straight defeats. \"We needed", "Lord Carey, who backed the benefit cap when Anglican bishops opposed it, urged the government to rethink the cuts in a statement to the Sun and the Mirror. Another former Archbishop, Rowan Williams, has also signalled his opposition to the move. But ministers say it is part of wider plans to raise pay and encourage work. The government has so far resisted calls to alter its plans. Under the government's plans, the earnings level above which tax credits are withdrawn will be lowered from \u00c2\u00a36,420 to \u00c2\u00a33,850, and the rate at which the benefit is lost as pay rises will be sped up. The changes are due to come into effect at the end of the year. Ministers argue the impact of the cuts will be mitigated by the new National Living Wage and higher tax thresholds. But Labour says three million families face losing an average of \u00c2\u00a31,000 a year. In his statement, Lord Carey wrote: \"I urge the government to reconsider these particular cuts to working tax credits that will hit many hard-working families very hard indeed.\" He told the BBC that while he had long been a supporter of the government's policies, cuts should not come at the expense of the most vulnerable. There was a chance now, he said, to show the reality of compassionate Conservatism. Lord Williams, meanwhile, told the Sun: \"There should be no debate about the aim of getting more people into employment. But it won't do to organise the system so that employment brings no advantages and no proper security for working people and their children. \"I don't think this is a party political issue. It ought to be agreed common sense and compassion.\" Chancellor George Osborne restated his commitment to cutting tax credits in the Sunday Telegraph. He wrote: \"It's simply not credible to impose higher wages and leave tax credits unreformed, condemning taxpayers to ever-higher welfare bills.\" The former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke, speaking to the BBC, urged Mr Osborne not to change his plans. But BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said some Conservatives privately have deep concerns about the cuts.", "But beyond the rhetorical flourishes, what did we learn? He had some extra money to play with thanks to Philip Hammond's budget: So \u00c2\u00a320m went on social care, there will be more Wi-fi on trains and there was the abolition of children's funeral costs in support of the campaign by the Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris at Westminster. The emotive appeal of the latter clearly had the biggest impact in the conference hall. The creation of a fair pay commission was heavily trailed in advance but the speech contained few details. In a sense what is more significant is what it tells us about the Welsh Government's approach to the economy over the next few years. The thinking is because the unemployment rate is so low in Wales, the focus now has to be less on quantity and more on quality. It is also a response to the Leave vote in Wales as senior figures in the party believe the main reason for the failure of Remain was to do with job insecurity and low pay. Carwyn Jones also made some big claims which deserve a closer look. In a bullish section on the NHS, he said waiting times were going down. In some areas this may be the case but there has been no broad-based substantial reduction in waits, and the latest figures reveal that waiting times in the Welsh NHS continue to lag behind the health service in England in most of the key categories for treatment and diagnosis. There was also a touch of bravado about the claim that the Welsh Government had saved the Welsh steel industry. It obviously went down well with the Labour rank and file in Llandudno, but in reality the continued operation of Port Talbot has more to do with changes to the pension system and the internal politics of Tata in India than noises from Cardiff Bay. Having said all that, this was the most relaxed I have seen Carwyn Jones make his big set-piece speech of the year to Labour in Wales. He has just turned 50 and still dodges the question about how long he plans to stay in the job. On today's reckoning, he does not look like he is going anywhere, particularly as he believes Brexit has just introduced an entirely new element to the job.", "He will take up his new post alongside the newly appointed Cabinet Secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood. Both will start in January 2012 and both will be paid the same salary of \u00c2\u00a3200,000. A No 10 spokesman said Sir Bob had been appointed after an open competition process. He declined to say how many other senior civil servants had applied for the post. Sir Bob will also continue in his current role as the top civil servant at the Department of Communities and Local Government. He replaces Sir Gus O'Donnell, who has held the post of civil service head - as well as cabinet secretary - for six years. His retirement on 31 December signals a major overhaul at the top of the Civil Service, with his role being carved into three parts. Mr Heywood will be the prime minister's principal policy adviser as well as being the new cabinet secretary - but not head of the civil service as Sir Gus had been. Prime Minister David Cameron decided to split up the roles because of the scale of the work involved. Mr Cameron said Sir Bob, a former chief executive of Sheffield Council and the Homes and Communities Agency, would bring a \"wealth of experience\" to the role. He added: \"This is a time of significant change and challenge for the Civil Service, driven by the demands for new skills and capabilities, and the delivery of substantial financial savings without compromising on standards. \"I feel absolutely confident that Bob and Jeremy will provide the leadership to ensure that our civil service continues to be admired around the world for its strength and professionalism.\" Sir Bob Kerslake said he was \"delighted and honoured\" to be offered the role at an important time for the Civil Service, which employs more than 450,000 people. \"We have immense strengths in the service that we should be justly proud of, but we must also embrace change. I want to engage all parts of the Civil Service in the reform process.\" The recruitment process was led by Sir David Normington, First Civil Service Commissioner and the former top civil servant at the Home Office.", "Gary Carruthers, 35, admitted his guilt and was jailed on Wednesday. Ch Supt George Clarke said PSNI officers had identified the children in the photos held by Carruthers and have already spoken to their parents. He said none of those in the images had reported \"contact offending\". Mr Clarke also reassured parents of children at the school that Carruthers had not shared the images with anyone else. Carruthers was caught by police with about 30,000 indecent images of children, some of the victims were as young as two years old. In a safe at his home, detectives also found computer discs and storage devices, manuals on how to abuse children, and even classroom registers. He pleaded guilty to possessing the indecent images and was sentenced to three years in prison. At the time of his arrest, parents at his former workplace were sent a note explaining that there was a child safeguarding issue at the school. Some parents have told the BBC they were not given enough information about the arrest and trial of the part-time cleaner at their child's school for such serious crimes against children. They also expressed concern about images of their children being distributed online, with one father asking: \"Is my wee girl's face on computer screens in other countries?\" Mr Clarke advised parents at the school that if they have not been contacted by police at this stage, they should not be concerned. The officer told the BBC that Carruthers \"used one of those images to manufacture an image of abuse\". \"So he took an abuse image he manufactured on the image of a child at the school. \"He also had a number of other images of children at the school, so any child that is in that group we have identified. \"We have spoken to the child and their parents and none of those have disclosed contact offending, so that should be a reassurance to the parents that we haven't spoken to that they're not in that category.\" \"It's also very important to note that there's no suggestion whatsoever that he was involved in distribution of these images,\" he added.", "Portraits are central to what makes photography so compelling, offering us a glimpse of our own past, drawing up long-forgotten moments or a glance at the lives of others. Whatever the limits of the camera are, for the most part, you can say that a picture shows something that once was. Mix that with our need to interpret the faces and poses we see in pictures, and good portraits come alive. That's the magic of photography, whereby a still and silent image can evoke far more than any moving pictures with sound ever will. A competition that focuses on this is, as the name suggests, the Portrait Salon and on Thursday, 29 November 2012, it is holding simultaneous projections at four venues across the country. The judges, Karen Newman from Open Eye Gallery, Hat Margolies from Lucid Rep, and photographer Dan Burn-Forti, selected the pictures to be shown from 1,110 entries. As you would expect, there are some cracking pictures on show. Portrait Salon was formed last year and describes itself as a form of Salon des Refuses - an exhibition of works rejected from a juried art show - that aims to showcase the best of the rejected images from the Taylor Wessing Portrait Prize, which is organised annually by the National Portrait Gallery (NPG). As the founders of Portrait Salon, Carole Evans and James O Jenkins write in the newspaper-style catalogue that accompanies the show, the idea began as an experiment and was not intended to upset or disrupt the Taylor Wessing, but to allow those whose work did not make the walls of the NPG another outlet. They write: \"We want to give exposure to those great images that for one reason or another don't make the cut but still deserve recognition.\" Add to this judge Karen Newman's remarks about the subjective process the act of judging is, and you get a truly delightful mix of pictures on show. You can see a few of them below and if you'd like to see the projection, details can be found on the Portrait Salon website or follow them on Twitter.", "The money will be used to recruit staff for nursing homes and to provide home care packages. The funds are for the independent sector only and are aimed at home helps and nurses working in privately-owned care homes. Their employers are to receive a 2% increase in the rate paid by the health trusts. The decision whether or not to pass that increase onto staff is at the employers' discretion. The Department of Health hopes that the money will be used to boost wages. Stephen Mooney, a healthcare assistant who works at Aughnacloy House care home in Lurgan, County Armagh, said problems recruiting staff were simply \"down to wages\". He receives about \u00a36.80 an hour and said he felt that rate did not reflect care workers' work and dedication. \"It's the type of job that unless you are committed, there's no point in being in it,\" he said. \"If there was a better hourly rate I think it would make more people come forward and there would be better opportunities for people like me.\" Mr Mooney said a pay increase \"would be a nice bonus\" for care workers. \"We're all dedicated, we work hard and that would enhance it for us.\" Health Minister Simon Hamilton said the care sector was \"a crucial partner\" in delivering vital services to vulnerable people. \"I am acutely aware of the different challenges they face including recruitment,\" he said. \"This support package should bring some stability and confidence to the sector and reassure residents and their families that we are doing all we can to ensure their continued well-being.\" Pauline Shepherd, the chief executive of Independent Health and Care Providers, welcomed the extra cash. \"Domiciliary care is nearly in crisis and a number of care homes have had to close,\" she said. \"I believe and I hope that it is an acknowledgement that something needs to be done urgently pending a more in-depth and fundamental consideration of what the problems are.\" The BBC understands the sector will receive an additional rise on 1 April to reflect the change due in the new compulsory National Living Wage of \u00a37.20 an hour, announced by the government last year.", "The company is the biggest electricity supplier, providing for more than half a million homes and 37,000 businesses in Northern Ireland. The price cut will come into force from 1 April. The company said the cut would mean the average household would save \u00c2\u00a350 a year, and \u00c2\u00a3200 a year for small businesses. Power NI will still be taking the same 2% slice of profits, and said they were able to introduce the cut because of a reduction in the wholesale price of gas in recent months. Gas is the biggest component in electricity generation, so electricity prices are more closely related to gas prices than oil prices which have fallen further over the last year. Kerstie Forsyth from Power NI said: \"We were able to buy cheaper wholesale electricity prices just before Christmas, and that was as a result of lower wholesale gas prices.\" Ms Forsyth said that because the company buys in advance, 1 April is the earliest moment that they can pass the savings on to customers. The change in price had to be cleared by the Utility Regulator because the company has such a big chunk of the electricity market. The regulator's chief executive Jenny Pyper said \"customers of Power NI can be confident that, due to our regulation of Power NI's prices, their bills reflect the actual costs of supplying electricity\". After significant fluctuations in recent years, Power NI's electricity price is now below the rate they charged in 2010. The smaller electricity providers are not regulated, but often follow the same rough trajectory as Power NI in order to compete. On Tuesday, Budget Energy announced a 5% price cut, and SSE Airtricity and Electric Ireland have yet to respond. Larger companies, who have recently raised concerns over energy costs are unlikely to see as big a drop. Expensive network costs make up a larger chunk of their bill, which will not be affected by this price cut. The Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association (NIIRTA) welcomed the price reduction. NIIRTA chief executive Glyn Roberts said: \"Energy costs are a top concern for our members, given many of them have refrigeration in their stores and so are pleased that this price reduction will bring bills down to 2008 prices.\"", "The crew of Katie Greves, Melanie Wilson, Frances Houghton, Polly Swann, Jessica Eddie, Olivia Carnegie-Brown, Karen Bennett and Zoe Lee held off Romania on the line. Great Britain were last at the halfway point but moved through the field in the second 1,000 metres. The US, heavy favourites, retained the gold they won in both 2008 and 2012. Like Britain, the US were behind Canada at the halfway point, but their superior power saw them surge ahead in the second half, taking victory in six minutes, 1.49 seconds. The American boat has now won 11 successive world or Olympic titles and matches the achievement of Romania, who were Olympic champions in 1996, 2000 and 2004. Find out how to get into rowing with our special guide. For Great Britain, urged on by cox Zoe de Toledo, a first Olympic medal comes after a fourth-placed finish at the 2015 World Championships. \"At 500m to go I thought we were going to win,\" Swann told BBC Sport. \"I believed with every stroke we had what it took. It does not take away from this silver, it is incredible. \"These girls are strong, sassy, inspirational and I am so proud of them.\" Before the Games there was some speculation that the British eight, the European champions, could have been joined by Katherine Grainger and Vicky Thornley when their double scull boat was dissolved. However, the existing team went on to win World Cup silver behind the US and each member out-performed Grainger and Thornley at unofficial trials. That led Grainger and Thornley to revive their double sculls boat - the silver they won on Thursday making Grainger Great Britain's most decorated female Olympian - with the eight", "The airline met Welsh business leaders on Tuesday to outline the benefits of the new route to the capital Doha. Since the new route was announced, sanctions have been placed on Qatar by its Middle East neighbours. \"We're operating 90% as normal - apart from the four countries affected,\" said Glen Mintrim, the airline's vice president for northern Europe. The sanctions include a refusal to allow Qatar Airways flights access to the region's air space which could add hours to journey times. The country has also been accused of supporting terrorist organisations. But Mr Mintrim does not anticipate problems. \"Last week we had our Dublin launch which started as planned, it's business as normal - nothing's changed.\" But he would not be drawn on the launch date, the frequency or cost of the flights. Attracting a long-haul route has been one of Cardiff Airport's main ambitions. It will be a key factor in its target of having two million passengers a year within the next five years. Airport bosses believe the regular flight to Doha will offer significant business opportunities not only for south Wales but also the south west of England. Deb Barber, chief executive of Cardiff Airport, said: \"It's transformational. It's been a long time part of our strategy to bring direct, long-haul flights to Wales and it's the only region not served at the moment, so there has been a huge gap in the market we have been looking to fill.\" Latest figures show that exports from Wales to Qatar amounted to \u00c2\u00a326m in 2016. James Bennett, sales and marketing director of Caerphilly-based aircraft parts company AerFin, is looking to more international growth. \"For us, if you look at the Middle East, it's a critical, strategic region,\" he said. \"It will see 3,500 aircraft deliveries over the course of the next 20 years. We, as a components support provider and lease services and solutions provider, will want to be a part of that growth. \"Anything that enables an easier link with that region will be a positive.\" Doha would also be a tourist destination in itself as well as allowing passengers access to a hub that provides flights. Qatar is one of the richest countries in the Middle East and will host the 2022 World Cup.", "The bright orange bus criticises what it calls \"gender ideology\" with the words \"you can't change sex\" and \"it's biology\" on its side. It closely resembles a Spanish bus created by a Catholic group that was forced off the roads by protesters. The US bus was vandalised at its first stop in New York. It is sponsored by conservative action groups the National Organization for Marriage, Citizen Go and the International Organization for the Family. The organisers say it is aimed at promoting \"the truth of gender\" which they say is \"determined by biology rather than by emotions and feelings\". Speaking while the transgender flag was raised over over City Hall, Boston's mayor Marty Walsh said: \"We are listening to our transgender community by making the city more inclusive. \"Its important for us to every now and then send a message, to let people know we will not be intimidated by discrimination or harassment. \"When you deny the experience of transgender individuals, you are denying the experience of basic human civil rights - in Boston and Massachusetts we are better than that. \"Together we are going to continue to fight intolerance with love and acceptance, and we will continue to fly this flag with pride in our hearts.\" Protesters surrounded the bus at the Massachusetts State House in Boston and in neighbouring Cambridge, near Harvard University. One protester wrote #HateSpeechBus on the bus in response to the campaign's slogan #FreeSpeechBus. A spokesman for the National Organization for Marriage told the BBC he was \"disappointed that people who preach tolerance and acceptance reacted to the bus by lashing out\". The spokesman insisted a significant proportion of the US population felt \"uncomfortable\" about the prospect of transgender people using public facilities such as changing rooms and bathrooms. He said the vandalism of the bus showed how \"people with alternative point of view on transgender issues are treated\", and called for their opinion to be treated with respect. The group had previously described the incident in New York as a \"vicious assault\" by \"LGBT extremists\" but said it was committed to continuing the East Coast tour. The bus will now travel to Connecticut, Philadelphia and Baltimore before its final stop in Washington DC.", "A review in May 2014 highlighted \"serious concerns\" over how elderly patients with dementia were treated at the Princess of Wales, Bridgend, and Neath Port Talbot hospitals. A report on Wednesday said the public should be \"significantly reassured\", but some areas required more work. The health board said it was pleased and heartened by the findings. The original Trusted to Care report gave 14 recommendations, of which eight still need attention. It prompted Health Minister Mark Drakeford to instigate a series of unannounced spot checks at district general hospitals in Wales. The Trusted to Care 2015 review by Professor June Andrews and Mark Butler that followed, pointed to more work needed in the following areas: It said a clear deadline for delivery must now be set. However it praised Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU) for its \"excellent\" progress in addressing issues with making sure elderly patients are well fed, given water and have opportunities to be mobile. The board has also made progress on making sure enough staff work on elderly care wards, and was praised for \"exemplary action\" in relation to tackling the improper administration of sedation and medicines. Overall the report concluded the two hospitals \"continued to be exemplary in part\" and improvements have been made in the areas where previous serious failings occurred. However the authors warned: \"There remains variation in the patient experience between wards and services, especially at the Princess of Wales hospital\", and \"more needs to be done\" to improve standards and professional practices. ABMU chief executive Paul Roberts said: \"We hope that patients, their families and the public are now assured about the care we are providing. \"It would be a foolish health organisation that claimed the care it provided was always perfect. But we hope that not only are we now providing better care, but our improved systems will help us pick up issues much sooner, deal with them quickly, and better help us learn from mistakes.\" Mark Drakeford said he was pleased the report had found progress had been made, and he expected the board to continue the work. Conservative shadow health minister Darren Millar said the progress was welcome but similar reassurances were also required at other sites, such as the Tawel Fan", "Mr Corbyn had imposed a three-line whip on his MPs to vote to back Brexit. But 52 Labour MPs rebelled in Wednesday's vote, including 11 junior shadow ministers, and three whips whose job it is to impose party discipline. Convention dictates that members of the leader's shadow team should resign or be sacked if they defy such an order. Some did resign, including shadow business secretary Clive Lewis, who was replaced by Rebecca Long-Bailey. But, after a meeting between Mr Corbyn and his chief whip Nick Brown, the remaining rebels will receive only a letter insisting that they must \"comply with the whip\" in the future. When the government brought its Brexit Bill to the Commons, Mr Corbyn said Labour would not seek to obstruct the EU referendum result. To ensure as many of his MPs supported him as possible, he imposed a three-line whip, the strictest instruction to vote with the party. 4 Shadow Cabinet re-shuffles in 18 months 32 resignations, of whom... 4 later returned to top positions 4 of those who quit, did so to vote against the Brexit Bill BBC political correspondent Chris Mason says the formal warnings leave the prospect, unless they are moved, of three whips trying to persuade their colleagues to vote with a leader who himself rebelled against Labour more than 400 times in government - and when they themselves have also defied him. There are still a \"couple of vacancies\" to be filled in Mr Corbyn's shadow team but it is not expected there will be any further announcements until next week. It has been announced that Ian Lavery and Andrew Gwynne have been appointed joint national elections and campaign coordinators for Labour. Jon Trickett has become shadow minister for the Cabinet Office and will remain shadow Lord President of the Council. In Wednesday's vote, the draft legislation was approved by 494 votes to 122, and now moves to the House of Lords. Prime Minister Theresa May wants to trigger formal Brexit talks by the end of March. She will do this by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty but requires Parliament's permission before doing so.", "The men were approached from behind by a man who shot them both in the head, a police spokesman said. Imam Maulama Akonjee, 55, moved to the city from Bangladesh two years ago, reports in New York said. Police said there were as yet \"no indications\" the men were targeted because of their faith. A man holding a gun was seen leaving the scene of the shooting in the Ozone Park area, but no-one has been arrested. Police said the suspect had a \"medium complexion\". Imam Akonjee and his assistant Thara Uddin, 64, were shot a short walk from the al-Furqan Jame mosque at about 13:50 local time (17:50 GMT) on Saturday. \"He would not hurt a fly,\" Imam Akonjee's nephew Rahi Majid, told the New York Daily News. \"You would watch him come down the street and watch the peace he brings.\" Friends of Imam Akonjee told media he had just left the mosque after prayers when he was shot. The mosque serves the large Bangladeshi community in Ozone Park. Dozens of people from the nearby Muslim community gathered at the scene to mourn and demonstrate, chanting \"We want justice\". Some of those attending the rally said the shooting was a hate crime, although police said they were still investigating the motive. Milat Uddin, who worships at the mosque, told Associated Press that authorities should treat the killing as a hate crime. \"We feel really insecure and unsafe in a moment like this,\" he told CBS New York. \"It's really threatening to us, threatening to our future, threatening to our mobility in our neighbourhood, and we're looking for the justice.\" \"These were two very beloved people. These were community leaders,\" Afaf Nasher, of the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told Reuters. \"There is a deep sense of mourning and an overwhelming cry for justice to be served.\" \"I understand the fear because I feel it myself. I understand the anger,\" said Sarah Sayeed, a member of New York mayor Bill De Blasio's staff who works as a liaison with Muslim communities. \"But it's very important to mount a thorough investigation.\"", "The gas-burner will have 750MW of capacity on stand-by in case other power sources fail. The move follows concerns that there will be insufficient reliable power in Scotland after the shut-down of the vast Longannet coal-burning plant in Fife. The closure is expected to take place within the next nine months. Smaller contracts have been agreed in other parts of the country, including Killingholme in Lincolnshire and Deeside in North Wales. The total cost is \u00c2\u00a336.5m, according to National Grid, providing up to 2.56GW of power across Britain. Three other SSE sites are to provide a much smaller 90MW total of back-up capacity; Keadby, Fiddler's Ferry and Ferrybridge. With an increasing share of electricity generated by wind, and limited cable capacity to import power from English power plants, Peterhead has been chosen to provide emergency cover if other sources of power do not meet demand in Scotland. A similar contract was signed to cover last winter. The contract with Perth-based owner SSE is for only one year, and would have the capacity to supply about 400,000 homes. The grid is being upgraded and expanded to allow for more transmission of power from plants south of the border, but these are not yet complete. In addition, Peterhead power station is being funded to provide voltage support to ensure a steady and reliable power supply, and it is still being considered for government support as the site for a large-scale trial project in carbon capture and storage. Jim Smith, the company's managing director for energy portfolio management, said: \"SSE has continually invested in the Peterhead site since it opened in 1980 and we're pleased it will continue to play an important role in ensuring National Grid can provide system stability and resilience going forward.\" Cordi O'Hara, director of market operation at National Grid, said: \"As operator of the electricity system, it's our role to ensure we've got the right tools in place to balance the system in even the toughest winter conditions. \"Our competitive tender has secured the reserve we need to do our job, as early as possible, while providing market certainty and keeping costs down for consumers.\"", "The study found abnormal sleeping patterns increased the risk of being overweight for those genetically predisposed to obesity. The effect was seen regardless of diet, health or socio-demographic group. The University of Glasgow study also found no clear link between sleep duration and body weight in those with a low genetic risk of obesity. Researchers looked at the effects of a short sleep of less than seven hours a night and a long sleep - more than nine hours - along with daytime napping and shift work. They found that in people with a high genetic risk of obesity, both short-sleep and long-sleep durations further increased risk of carrying excess weight, compared with people who slept for normal durations of between seven and nine hours a night. Long sleepers with a risk of obesity were about 4kg heavier and short sleepers were about 2kg heavier than those with a similarly high genetic obesity risk with normal sleep durations. The negative affect happened irrespective of what subjects ate, their health concerns or socio-demographic factors, the research team said. The findings, based on data from almost 120,000 UK Biobank participants, showed no obvious link between sleep duration and body weight in those considered to be at a low genetic risk of obesity. Dr Jason Gill, from the Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, said: \"These data show that in people with high genetic risk for obesity, sleeping for too short or too long a time, napping during the day and shift work appears to have a fairly substantial adverse influence on body weight. \"However, the influence of adverse sleep characteristics on body weight is much smaller in those with low genetic obesity risk - these people appear to be able to 'get away' with poorer sleep habits to some extent.\" Co-author Dr Carlos Celis said: \"It appears that people with high genetic risk for obesity need to take more care about lifestyle factors to maintain a healthy body weight. \"Our data suggest that sleep is another factor which needs to be considered, alongside diet and physical activity.\" The study, said to be the first to examine the interactions of sleeping habits and genes with obesity, is published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.", "The pair, who both work for Edinburgh council but were not named in court, were found guilty of contempt in 2013. A sheriff ruled they were in contempt for failing to obey a court order for a mother to have weekly contact with her sons, who had been taken into care. But a judgement from the Court of Session has overturned that decision. Three senior judges found there had been serious concerns for the wellbeing of the children and that the social workers, who were in a \"difficult situation\", had the best interests of the youngsters at heart. In his ruling, judge Lord Malcolm said that a decision made by the social worker to suspend contact \"out of a genuinely held concern\" of risk to the children, could not be categorised as contempt of court. The social workers, named in court papers as AB and CD, are \"senior and experienced\" employees who were found in contempt over their failure to obey a court order from May 2013. Earlier that year, a children's hearing reduced contact between the mother and her boys, who were in care, from weekly to monthly. But she appealed to the sheriff, who granted weekly contact with each child. In July 2013, AB suspended contact, a decision approved by CD, her immediate superior. AB referred to the boys being \"distressed, distraught and at times traumatised\" and wrote that it was her view\" that the weekly contact could not be continued in good conscience, knowing the dire effect it has been having on both children\". Following a complaint letter from the mother's solicitor, the sheriff ultimately found that both social workers had failed to obey the court and found them guilty of a contempt of the authority of the court. No penalty was imposed but they were found liable for the expenses of the proceedings. The three Court of Session judges unanimously ruled in favour of the social workers on Friday. Quashing the contempt ruling, Lord Malcolm said: \"The court should be sensitive to the difficult situation in which these, and no doubt the other social workers involved, were placed. \"In the context of their long involvement in the case, and the burden of a duty to safeguard the welfare of the children, they adopted a precautionary", "He suggested clubs were demanding inflated prices for players. \"We are not a club that is ready to pay what the clubs want,\" said Mourinho, who has signed two players this summer after asking United for four. \"I'm used to clubs paying big for big players. Now everybody pays big money for good players.\" United have spent \u00a375m on Everton striker Romelu Lukaku and \u00a331m on Benfica defender Victor Lindelof since the end of last season. The capture of Belgium international Lukaku pushed the total spent by Premier League clubs in this transfer window beyond \u00a3500m. Accountancy firm Deloitte said Premier League sides are on course to surpass the record \u00a31.165bn they spent last summer. On Wednesday, Chelsea agreed a fee of about \u00a350m with Real Madrid for forward Morata. United tried to sign the 24-year-old Spain international earlier this summer but were unable to agree a price, which Mourinho said was \"a shame\". \"I'm not interested in what Chelsea FC does,\" the Portuguese said of his former club. \"It was obvious they were going to sign a striker after the situation with the manager and Diego.\" Spain striker Diego Costa has been told by Chelsea manager Antonio Conte that he is not in the club's plans. United play Manchester City in the International Champions Cup in Houston on Thursday, the first Manchester derby to be held outside England. Twelve months ago, a planned pre-season friendly between the sides in Beijing was cancelled because of the state of the pitch at the Bird's Nest Stadium following poor weather. Despite the rivalry between United and City, Mourinho described the game as \"a training session\". However, United forward Marcus Rashford said: \"I know it is branded as a friendly but naturally, it is never a friendly for the people who are on the pitch.\" The match at the NRG Stadium kicks off at 21:00 local time (03:00 BST on Friday). All players will wear shirts featuring the worker bee symbol in tribute to the victims of May's Manchester attack. The shirts will be sold at auction after the game to raise funds for the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund.", "The \"Rhodes Must Fall\" group met to discuss its next move after Oriel College said the monument would stay. The group says Rhodes, a 19th Century businessman and politician in southern Africa, represents white supremacy. The university said it had already invited the group to help it achieve an \"ever-more inclusive community\". The group issued seven demands, including a call for Oxford to \"acknowledge and confront its role in the ongoing physical and ideological violence of empire\". A university spokesman said the institution was \"engaged in constructive and productive dialogue with students on a range of equality and diversity issues\". He said: \"Last Friday, we re-extended our invitation to Rhodes Must Fall to join other students in this effort to achieve an ever-more inclusive university community. In particular, we wish to discuss the need to address the under-representation of black and minority ethnic (BME) students... We hope they will accept this opportunity.\" Campaign organiser Sarah Atayero said: \"We continue to believe that the removal and relocation of the monument to Cecil Rhodes is critical for Oxford to reckon with its past, and for Oxford to acknowledge the present-day issues it faces around racism and representation.\" Oriel College denied claims that donors threatened to withdraw more than \u00c2\u00a3100m of funding if the statue was removed. Rhodes was a student at Oxford and a member of Oriel College in the 1870s and went on to become prime minister of the Cape Colony in the 1890s. He also gave his name to the historical region known as Rhodesia, which is now Zambia and Zimbabwe. When Rhodes died in 1902, he left money to Oriel College. A scholarship programme in his name has so far been awarded to more than 8,000 overseas students. The \"Rhodes Must Fall\" campaign began in South Africa, where a Rhodes statue was removed, and the movement was adopted by campaigners in Oxford. On Thursday, the college said the statue should remain but it would add \"a clear historical context to explain why it is there\". It said: \"The college believes the recent debate has underlined that the continuing presence of these historical artefacts is an important reminder of the complexity of history and of the legacies of colonialism still felt today.\"", "The south Wales force has been given \u00a3155,000 to be one of six UK forces to test the system and public reaction.

The force's police and crime commissioner said the technology should strengthen criminal cases and protect police from wrongful accusations. The \u00a31.4m funding trial was approved by Home Secretary Teresa May, an advocate of the technology, last week. The other police forces in the trial are Hampshire, Leicestershire, Durham, Thames Valley and the Metropolitan Police. Once switched on by officer, the device records what an officer sees to a hard drive. The recording can be download by the officer when back at base. Gwent Police has another \u00a3100,000 of its own money to raise the number of officers to be trained to 360, with the first expected to be used from April. Police commissioner Ian Johnston said: \"Body worn camera evidence is impactful and irrefutable and the principles of securing and preserving evidence are enhanced by them. They will strengthen cases going to the criminal courts. \"Scientific research also supports the evidence that body worn cameras can assist in de-escalating an incident when the offenders are made aware of its presence. \"In some cases, they could also provide evidence that will help those who feel aggrieved over the way they have been treated by the police and also to help protect police officers themselves from wrongful accusations. \"I'm confident that the benefits of using these cameras and the associated technology will be realised in terms of criminal justice savings and in terms of police officer integrity and safety.\" Gwent temporary deputy chief constable, Lorraine Bottomley, said: \"Evidence from other force areas which have used this technology indicates that its can increase the number of early guilty pleas and successful prosecutions in relation to incidents investigated by the police. \"Other forces have also seen a decline in the number of vexatious or spurious complaints against officers which can waste a lot of precious police time and resources.\" Body-worn video was first used in Britain by Devon and Cornwall Police in 2006.

Last month, when unprecedented floodwaters engulfed Cumbria, he watched 160 of them drown. On the 12th December Mr Stobart got a phone call at 08:30 to say that some of his sheep were stranded. It should have been a short drive to the field, but roads and bridges were impassable. By the time he got there several hours later, he found a lethal fast-flowing expanse of water between him and his flock. \"It was awful. The sheep had been standing in the water for hours,\" he said. \"The fire service were trying to do their best, but as we walked out they moved away from us, out in to the current. We rescued a couple but the others were swept away - it was too dangerous to try to reach them.\" Sheep are very vulnerable in floods, their wool becomes waterlogged and they get dragged under. \"It was absolutely horrendous,\" he says, his eyes shining with tears. \"You've worked all year to see the best out of them, and then something happens that is out of everyone's control and there's nothing you can do. It's absolutely torture to watch.\" Every sheep is tagged - if they are found, then James gets a call. He has some photos of the piles of mangled bodies of his sheep. \"We've found about half of them. We don't know if we'll ever find the rest.\" Across Cumbria some 630 farms were affected by the flooding, and around 2,000 sheep drowned. Mr Stobart puts the value of his ones that he lost at \u00c2\u00a312,000. This won't put him out of business - the family has 1,300 breeding sheep.

It is now one in three, compared with one in 10 in 2005. Children with their own books were more likely to be above-average readers and do better at school, the study of 18,000 children suggested. Poorer children and boys were less likely to have books, it added. The survey was carried out in September with school-aged children from 111 schools across the UK. It suggested that a third (33.2%) did not have books of their own. That translates to 3.8m children UK-wide. Better off children and young people were more likely to say they had books of their own, compared with those who received free school meals. Trust director Jonathan Douglas said the steep rise in the number of children without their own books was of particular concern. He said: \"We know there is a direct correlation between book ownership and children's reading abilities. \"With one in 6 in the UK struggling with literacy it is very worrying that many children could be missing out on opportunities to develop these essential skills.\" The trust said that children who owned books were more likely than others to read every day, and that book ownership had a clear link with reading ability. Of the children and young people with books of their own, more than half read above the level expected for their age, with fewer than one in 10 reading below the level. By contrast, among those without books of their own, nearly a fifth were failing to meet the expected reading level, with only a third reading above that level. The trust launched the survey to coincide with an appeal for public donations towards books and reading support for disadvantaged children. A number of children's book illustrators have designed cards to support the trust's Christmas Gift of Reading campaign. The survey also revealed links between reading ability and receiving books as presents. About a fifth of children said they had never been to a book shop or a library. But the survey also showed that reading any type of material, for example magazines, outside class at least once a month was also associated with greater reading attainment.", "One study solely on pacemakers found more than 8,000 known vulnerabilities in code inside the cardiac devices. The other study of the broader device market found only 17% of manufacturers had taken steps to secure gadgets. The reports come soon after more than 60 health organisations in the UK fell victim to a cyber-attack. The report on pacemakers looked at a range of implantable devices from four manufacturers as well as the \"ecosystem\" of other equipment used to monitor and manage them. Researcher Billy Rios and Dr Jonathan Butts from security company Whitescope said their study showed the \"serious challenges\" pacemaker manufacturers faced in trying to keep devices patched and free from bugs that attackers could exploit. They found that few of the manufacturers encrypted or otherwise protected data on a device or when it was being transferred to monitoring systems. Also, none was protected with the most basic login name and password systems or checked that devices they were connecting to were authentic. Often, wrote Mr Rios, the small size and low computing power of internal devices made it hard to apply security standards that helped keep other devices safe. In a longer paper, the pair said device makers had work to do more to \"protect against potential system compromises that may have implications to patient care\". Mr Rios said all the problems he and his co-workers uncovered had been reported to the US Department of Homeland Security, which oversees companies that make medical devices. The separate study that quizzed manufacturers, hospitals and health organisations about the equipment they used when treating patients found that 80% said devices were hard to secure. Bugs in code, lack of knowledge about how to write secure code and time pressures made many devices vulnerable to attack, suggested the study. Despite acknowledging these problems, only 9% of device makers and 5% of health organisations tested equipment annually for potential security vulnerabilities, it found. A higher percentage of makers, 17%, took steps to secure the equipment they made. The study found that 49% of manufacturers were not using advice from the US Food and Drug Administration about how to secure devices. \"The security of medical devices is truly a life or death issue for both device manufacturers and healthcare delivery organisations,\" said Dr Larry Ponemon, co-author of the study, with security company Synopsys. \"It is urgent that the medical device industry makes the security of its devices a high priority,\" he said."], "sampled": ["It would be the first increase since the rate was cut to near zero during the 2008 financial crisis.

Only about half of Americans (49%) now believe that people convicted of capital crimes should be killed.\n\nFor years, public opinion, based on surveys, has been divided over the death penalty: A majority of Americans support it, but it is opposed strongly by a minority.\n\nThe poll found that about half of Republicans (52%) favor the execution of criminals for murder, compared with 44% of Democrats and 43% of independents. The poll was conducted in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, including more than 7,000 people who said they supported capital punishment.\n\nEven younger people who have been more strongly against capital punishment for years are more open to the idea today. That shift may be associated with the recent shift in attitude among older Americans, who, according to the survey, continue to oppose executions of people convicted of murder.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Obama has declined to speak directly on the issue. In a statement in July, though, Mr. Obama cited the poll, saying: \"Public opinion on capital punishment has steadily increased in recent years. The question then becomes: Have the courts and other voices in society over time changed to make the death penalty more appropriate for the crime, as the poll suggests?\"\n\nDespite the recent decline in support for the death penalty, Mr. Allen said that a strong majority of people oppose capital punishment on a per person basis. He said: \"If there is a deterrent, then, well, that's good.\"\n\nHe said that one of the biggest reasons for the decline in support for the death penalty is that judges have become more lenient over time with what constitutes murder, and that more and more people do not agree that the death penalty is appropriate for killing an unarmed person.\n\n\"Those of us who've dealt with the death penalty since its inception have seen that this is going to be a pretty tough proposition.

For example, energy could eventually be generated by the motion of the sun. As the sun moves through our atmosphere the electrical current generated will \"generate electricity for use in the solar cells where it would be stored and transferred to other parts of the world.\"\n\nOne other possible application for the zeroes is to build a computer.

The parents of infants were told there were no ashes. Aberdeen City Council's official guidebook describes the process differently, with a section saying \"the dead infant or younger child is generally laid to rest face down on a single mat (the \"carpet\") on which ashes have been placed; after the mat is set in a proper position, the ashes are wrapped around it and laid to rest next to the child in a resting pose\". (page 25) In fact, cremation is the normal procedure as well as the preferred approach, with the exception of infants in the first months of life or in the womb. The council's official guidebook for children aged one to five states that \"burial should take place in an area designated for cremation (such as on a gravestone) and remains should be removed by a licensed undertaker (who will usually carry out a pre-arranged pre-burn burial)\".(page 543) It added that \"burnings shall not take place unless directed by a coroner\". The only exception is an infant in the last trimester of pregnancy after normal birth (see Children at Sea). In practice, the law seems to be that most children are cremated.

Residents on the ground floor who also pay a premium have not had their fees increased whilst the club's staff pay no fees, despite the fact that they remain in the house.\nHere's my take. I've already been a long standing supporter of The Hoops for many years, and even though I'm on the ground floor, this is an important issue that needs to be addressed before the season starts. The Hoops have a long standing habit of overcharging the rent money of the community surrounding them. These charges often amount to \u00a3600 \u2013 \u00a3700 a year. In my view, this is wrong, as the club has a duty to the people of this area to pay the lowest possible rental price for the land. I've been offered free tickets to the away games in future to protest, so we are hoping there is a change soon.\n\n\nWhat do you think?

The DUP is to table a 'fantasy' budget to executive ministers on Wednesday which would cut \u00a3250 million from the \u00a311 billion welfare bill, leaving the government with no money to hand out.\n\nHowever, the DUP budget is likely to raise some eyebrows in Stormont, as it will feature a number of items that have been vetoed by the unionists before.\n\nThe DUP is expected to increase spending on the police, in particular the \u00a3900,000 increase proposed for the Northern Ireland Serious Crime Intelligence and Emergency Response Team (Sio-Eirr) budget. The Sio-Eirr unit is part of the police which deals with the terrorist threat.\n\nA recent survey by the Institute for Public Policy Research, Northern Ireland, revealed a reduction in the number of officers on duty across Northern Ireland from 18,749 in 2010 to 17,945 in 2016. The fall has been driven by a fall in the number of officers who are on leave due to personal reasons, which have risen by 60% between March 2013 and March 2015.\n\nA spokesperson for the PSNI said: \"The police are a service for the whole community, including members of our religious community. They protect us and keep us safe. We can continue to rely on the dedicated efforts of the PSNI to fight crime and terrorism in Northern Ireland from this day to the next.\"\n\nA DUP spokesman said: \"Northern Ireland is not and never will be a monoculture. Northern Ireland is a diversity paradise. Northern Ireland has the highest number of Muslims in Europe. The DUP believes that Northern Ireland is a multicultural and multi-cultural society, and the number one priority of the DUP is to ensure that this continues. Our priority is to make Northern Ireland one of the most equal societies in the world.\"\n\nThe budget also includes an increase in the funding to the Belfast Fire and Rescue Service (BFRS) from \u00a319.5 to \u00a321.5 million.\n\nIt is also understood Northern Ireland's police and fire services will face cuts in their budgets.\n\nDespite the financial challenges, the DUP budget is likely", "The research reported lower sales and turnover, with poorer profit growth. Those taking part in the study expected turnover to increase by only 1% in the next 12 months. The business's net cost of trading also increased by \u00a33.7m from the \u00a35.3m the year previously.\n\n\"The results make bleak reading for a small trader which has faced mounting financial challenges in recent years,\" said the study. \"For a trader to be losing \u00a312,000 a month puts them in the bottom 20% of traders in the city.\" It estimates the losses since the start of 2014 to be at least \u00a330m. Last year's report said losses reached \u00a330m.\n\nA spokesperson for BHS said the business was on track to return to profit and warned that while there had been an improvement, there were signs of improvement which could potentially lead to it returning to profit in the \"near future\". \"Nevertheless, BHS is currently unable to show any significant signs at this point that things are going to get better. Our target is to return to profitability by approximately the end of 2017,\" she said.\n\nThe retailer was already planning ahead for the possibility of it going out of trade following its sale by Sainsbury's in 2012. The current report shows that BHS, which employs around 50,000 people, has been unable to meet its financial targets and may continue to do so despite its improvement, it said.\n\nA second report published by the charity, Invest, on Wednesday warns that it is too early to fully assess the impact of the closure of BHS. Investment, which is now backed by the co-operative group which owns the iconic store, argued that many BHS staff would remain with the retailer to take its place once the company is closed.\n\nHowever, the charity claims that despite this, the closure will be a severe blow to the small business community and small firms around the country. \"At its heart, the business community of Birmingham has a long history, of working hard for those around them, and this community has worked tirelessly to ensure BHS has succeeded. That work is now over,\" said Invest in its report.\n\nThe charity said it was critical that \"immediate action is taken to secure jobs for the many BHS", "The comment comes after the Welsh Government said deaths had stabilised following a significant rise towards the end of the last decade.

There are a number of existing homes in the area that have been refurbished and I understand the council is now working on securing building consent for these.\"\n\nMr Rowlands added: \"Although the new development can provide 1,000 new homes, it is also important that the existing buildings are protected to prevent unnecessary deterioration of buildings, which are not currently being used as a primary purpose for their purpose under the local regeneration plan.\"\n\nLiz Wynne, chief executive of Community Action, the group that led the campaign against the decision to allow the demolition, said the council had taken the decision after only accepting the consultation response.\n\nShe said Mr Rowlands had confirmed this during an earlier meeting.\n\n\"Our community are already living in fear because of the destruction of Bryn Estyn Castle, which was demolished as part of the local regeneration plan five years ago.

Another former Archbishop, Peter Smith, said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the announcement.\n\n\"I would have thought a country of 80 million could not afford to be this irresponsible,\" he said.\n\n\"The truth is that there is an urgent need for our government to be honest about the cost of its welfare reforms.\"\n\nOn Monday George Osborne said \"no one can take food from the mouths of the children\" but the government was not backing down.\n\nHe said: \"We are not making cuts for the sake of reducing the deficit.\n\n\"We know that children in poor neighbourhoods have the same level of deprivation as other children in affluent areas, despite the fact that they are in poorer areas.\n\n\"That's why we have tried through housing benefit, working tax credits, universal credit, to give every household on the minimum wage at least a free meal a day.\"\n\nHe continued: \"When we talk about welfare we have to remember, too, that so many children in poverty have parents who are working. And so for this reason we can see no contradiction between keeping child poverty down and making sure poor people can put food on the table by taking money from people who are working.\"\n\nHowever, in November Mr Gove ruled out further welfare cuts, saying he only wanted to save \u00a323bn from \"tax and spend\", pointing to the \u00a315bn saving promised by George Osborne.\n\nMr Osborne in turn has been mocked relentlessly as he attempts to sell the Budget to an increasingly sceptical public.\n\nThe former Chancellor has been criticized for failing to make a credible case for scrapping universal credit. The \"sham\" reform will see millions of low income workers lose the benefit because they only meet basic conditions of income, such as attending school and looking for jobs.\n\nIt has a reported \u00a33bn in the pipeline.\n\nThe Telegraph reports that Conservative MPs are increasingly voicing a series of concerns regarding the cuts, including what will happen to thousands of young unemployed individuals.\n\n\"The cuts do", "But beyond the rhetorical flourishes, what did we learn?

Not only that, but he got to cut one of every 11 jobs. Yet despite all that, Osborne's budget was a colossal flop, with GDP contracting by an unprecedented 2 per cent over the two years following the Budget in June 2016. As ever, the reality is that the UK economy would be stronger if there had been a larger fiscal transfer from the rest of the world to the UK.\n\nAnd perhaps because Osborne's budget was so badly received, and because the Brexit vote has forced the government into a tailspin of spending cuts, he is now facing even more severe criticism from his own backbenches. Some of the Tory backbenchers have said they will never support his budget in its current form \u2013 especially now that they have been put in the position of having to negotiate Brexit with the EU.\n\nFor me, as a Conservative MP, there is no chance of me ever voting for a budget that does not contain some elements of \"social justice\". If Britain is ever to regain its global reputation as a \"plastic\" society than we need an economy that is a meritocracy, and one in which everyone has the opportunity to aspire to good jobs and a decent life.\n\nWe need a culture in which everyone is held to account: no one is too small, or too fat, or too young, to do well\n\nThe new Labour leader is no friend to the status quo, either \u2013 and he is right to make the case for an honest assessment of what is working and what isn't.

They were granted vast areas of land in the 16th and 17th centuries by the Houses of Royal Great Britain and are, after England, the wealthiest and best-known of England's noble houses.\n\nWhen King William III granted them large-scale land holdings in the early 17th century, the Dukes of Cornwall had already built numerous large houses and castles in Dorset. As late as 1824, the Royal Household's annual reports referred to the Duchies as \"our principal domains\" that would remain in \"the same condition to which they have been established since the year 1612\".\n\n\nThe Duchies hold lands, estates and crown lands covering more than 600,000 acres in North East England in addition to all existing holdings of Duchy of Cornwall and Duchy of Northumberland.\n\nIn 2008, Sir Peter Westmacott, the Duke of Cornwall and Northumberland, described the Duchies as \"the UK's most powerful house of Lords\".\n\nThey are also thought to have the most-protected pension scheme and property portfolio in Britain, according to the Financial Times.\n\nIn total, the Duchies are thought to have", "Gary Carruthers, 35, admitted his guilt and was jailed on Wednesday. Ch Supt George Clarke said PSNI officers had identified the children in the photos held by Carruthers.\n\nCh Supt Clarke said: \"This was a shocking case where police officers, who had been given a tip-off, were able to identify the children in a series of photographs \u2013 images of abuse, and there is no evidence to suggest these children were placed at risk in any way. These are simply images taken from the internet.\" Asked specifically about the fact that a number of the pictures in the original call remained online after Carruthers was tracked to the area, the officer said: \"I wouldn't have thought so, but it may have occurred at a later date. It could have happened, it wouldn't have seemed a surprise\".\n\nCarruthers worked at the RUC HQ in Portadown where the abuse claims first came to light and was on duty on the night of June 15, 1996. After a police officer gave a call-back to a young person identified by Carruthers as one of the victims, he became involved. The abuse ended up with young male victims being interviewed by officers and their parents being visited. Carruthers was suspended before his arrest more than a year later.\n\nIt follows the arrest a fortnight ago of David McGough after five months on the run after admitting possessing extreme images which included the children being abused.\n\nThe abuse came to light after McGough was tracked down by his wife, who noticed a large number of pictures of abuse. The children the RUC inspector had worked with were shown many of the photos of abuse. She found it odd that she and his children had been involved.\n\nCarruthers will be sentenced on 30 September. He was found guilty of abuse of a child under 13 \u2013 the same charge the RUC inspector pleaded guilty to. He was also found guilty of conspiracy to sexually assault child victims younger than 13.\n\nHis fellow RUC officer, Peter Connolly, 40, also from Portadown, was found not guilty of sexually assaulting a child, possessing extreme pornography and possession of extreme pornography with intent.\n\nAfter", "Portraits are central to what makes photography so compelling, offering us a glimpse of our own past, drawing up long-forgotten moments or a glance at the lives of others.

It's not a one-way street \u2013 this is purely about me taking photos and painting, with the idea being that each one will inspire me to push myself further as I paint, even if the photo is a 'failure' (or something I would rather have not taken). I find that looking at my photos with other people can be a very enjoyable pastime and I hope that for this project and for future ones, it can bring people along with me.\n\nThere is also a video on Youtube that I wish to share, showing the process through a conversation with my partner Ben:\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I want to give back. Photography is incredibly subjective and often we see things only through our own eyes, so what I find is that I love doing portraits when I work with a partner. It doesn't matter if I'm doing the whole painting or just my arm, as long as the other person helps shape the image. And of course, the last minute is the best time to do these. Sometimes you just want it done and no time is available after the picture is taken.

It takes effect just over a week before the Easter weekend, when people on many rural electricity tariffs will be switching to cheaper electricity.\n\nThe union is calling on the eight suppliers to join the cut on behalf of their customers. If they do not agree to participate, they will be liable to pay the costs for any consumers who choose to switch off by switching off the electricity, says Gerry Quinn of TUI Power and Energy.\n\nThe union said the move would be an \"absolute game changer\" for people who currently pay the highest electricity bills. It believes that a 10% discount will mean households will save \u20ac120 for a typical three-year cycle.\n\n\"This is a real opportunity for customers who are just starting off in the market to save,\" Mr Quinn said.\n\n\"This reduction in the price of power is particularly important for customers who are on contracts which have variable tariffs. Many of these customers do not have the option of switching off and this would mean that they are paying more for basic bills,\" he said.\n\nThe union said some small businesses, who are paying over \u20ac100 a year on electricity, would be saved by switching off. They will save around \u20ac5 a year through switching off.\n\nThe company said its current prices are competitive with the UK and Europe.\n\nBut, it is not cutting prices by 8%, as announced last year, because new contracts have come into force this year.

The effect was seen regardless of diet, health or socio-demographic traits.\n\n\"The association with obesity and the abnormal sleep times remained apparent even for the people who were healthy, which was surprising,\" said principal investigator Dr Sarah Tishkoff, Senior Lecturer in Epidemiology at the University of Stirling's School of Medicine in Scotland.\n\n\"There's no clear explanation for the underlying molecular mechanism. Our next step is to investigate why and the possibility of using pharmaceutical intervention to tackle this issue at an early stage.\"\n\nThe analysis of the genetic variants associated with sleep abnormalities also highlighted the importance of environmental factors which contribute to these variations in sleep patterns. This was particularly highlighted for genes contributing to the genetic architecture of obesity, in particular, the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) binding protein 4 (Kf4) gene.\n\nResearchers determined that both children and adults who were overweight or obese also had lower levels of levels of the hormone prolactin in their blood. Prolactin stimulates the growth hormone into action. The findings also shed light on why children's sleep patterns are at a greater risk for obesity. This study also found that children without a genetic predisposition to obesity, were at a greater risk for abnormal sleep patterns even when they were healthy.\n\n###\n\nThe study was funded by the Wellcome Trust, and by the Medical Research Council.\n\nThe University of Stirling is one of the four UK-wide universities ranked in the Top One per cent of the world's universities in Science, Engineering and Research (SEER).

In the past two years, more than half of heart pacemakers have been recalled due to a manufacturing defect, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\nSurgical implants and heart valve devices were the most vulnerable to attack by hackers, and those attacks typically involved inserting malicious firmware into the operating systems, according to a 2014 security analysis report from a company called Symantec.

The implants\u2014a pacemaker, for example\u2014could be hacked without a patient's knowledge. If there is a problem with the pacemaker, it could communicate through wires to the hospital that will have to be severed. If the implanter is working properly and the doctor has ordered an incorrect length wire, a hacker could turn it into a deadly weapon that could kill patients.
