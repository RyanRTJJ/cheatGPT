Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Little Lily who was gifted with the unique ability to control every aspect of her dreams. In these dreams, she could fly, visit fantastical lands, and be anyone she wanted to be. Her dreams were so vivid and beautiful that Lily began to believe in dreaming that she started to view her waking life as merely a waiting period between dreams and spend her days in a fantasy talking about the adventures that awaited her in her next dream. She stopped paying attention in class and stopped participating in activities with her friends. All she wanted was to sleep so she could enter her dream world and sleep while in the middle of a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice calling out to her. "Lily, look up! You need to hear this!" Startled, she opened her eye and found herself staring into the concerned face of her mother.

"What's wrong?" Lily asked, still groggy from sleep.

"I'm worried about you, Lily," the voice said. "You've been spending all your time with your imaginary friends and neglecting your responsibilities. You need to start putting some real effort into your life too."

Lily brushed off her mother's concerns, insisting that her dreams were the only things that mattered. But her mother persisted, telling her that life was full of experiences and opportunities that she was missing out on by spending all her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to see her mother's point. She started paying attention to music and dance again, and even joined a few clubs . She found that by putting in effort in her waking life, she was able to achieve things that she had only ever dreamed of before.

Over time, Lily began to realize that life was not as exciting and limitless as she imagined, but was full of possibilities as her dreams. She still looked forward to sleeping and controlling her dreams, but now she was also eager to experience the excitement each day would bring. She learned that life was worth her time and that by putting in the work, she could see many rewarding things both in her waking life and in her dreams.
