the head of . "Our government has always known that the Earth is flat. It's a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few within the government and scientific communities. When the incoming President asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the we have kept this a secret is because it involves mass panic and destruction if the public were to learn the truth," I explained.

"But why would that be?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would completely undermine our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics," I answered. "It would also raise s the questions of who we were before, and our place in the world and our purpose as a species."

The President nodded thoughtfully. "I see your point," he said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know the truth?" He nodded. "Yes, I think they do. But we need to be careful about how we reveal this information. But we need to make sure that people understand the significance of what it means for our world."

The President nodded again, and I could tell he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with me," he said.

As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for so long, but we knew that we were doing the universe's bidding by keeping the truth hidden for now. Perhaps one day, when everything is ready, we can reveal the truth and begin to explore the secrets of our flat Earth.
