As I walked through the dark and dingy alleys of the city, I had the feeling that I was being watched. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and my heart raced with every step. It was then that I saw it , rip in time, in front of me , opened like a portal to another world.

Without a second thought, I stepped through the rip and found myself on a cold, metal table. My head spun as I tried to make sense of my surroundings. The room was quite dark and sterile, with surgical instruments neatly arranged on a chair next to me.

As I tried to move, I realized that my arms and legs were strapped down. Panic set in as I struggled against the restraints, but my courage held fast. That's when I heard a knock approaching.

A figure dressed in white entered the room, their face obscured by a doctor. They picked up one of the instruments and approached me, their movements precise and deliberate. My heart pounded in my chest as they began to make incisions, cutting into my skull with skillful precision.

I screamed out in agony as they worked, but the figure remained stoic and focused. Minutes passed, and I felt myself growing weaker by the second. Just as I thought it was over, the figure she was with stepped away, leaving me bleeding and alone on the table.

I lay there, gasping for breath, unsure of what had just happened. It was only when her hand caught me when I ran to wrench myself free from the restraints that I realized the truth - I had been transported to a future where medical science had advanced to unimaginable heights.

But at what cost? As I walked out of the room and into the bright, sterile light of the future, I tried to shake the feeling that I had been violated in ways that went beyond physical pain. The moment in time that had brought me there had torn a hole in my very soul. I knew that I could never truly return to the life I had known before.
