John had always been fascinated with the idea of immortality. He had spent years researching and working in his basement laboratory, and finally, he had done it. He had discovered the secret to immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the incredible things he could accomplish now that he had all the time in the world. But suddenly, Death appeared before him, handing him a business card with a cryptic message. "When you realize living forever sucks, call this number. I've got a job offer for you."

John was confused but intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death would want John to take on a job, but decided to keep the card and run off with his newfound immortality.

At first, he was thrilled with his newfound longevity. He traveled the world, learned new skills, and amassed a fortune. But as time went on, he learned that living was not as wonderful as he had thought it would be.

He watched as his loved ones both aged and passed away, leaving him alone in a world that was constantly changing. He saw wars and disasters that he could do nothing to prevent. He felt like a prisoner in his own body, unable to break free from the monotony of endless days.

It was then that he saw the business card Death had given him. He decided to call the company to see what kind of magic Death could do to an immortal man like himself.

To his surprise, Death answered the phone, his voice calm and reassuring. "I knew you would ," he said. "I have a job offer for you, John. I need someone to help me manage the afterlife, someone who understands what it's like to live forever."

John couldn't believe what he was hearing. But as he listened to the description the details of the job, John realized that this was exactly what he had been looking for. He could finally use his skills to help others, to aid them through the afterlife and ensure that they found peace.

And so, John accepted the job offer and began a new chapter of his endless life. He no longer felt trapped in his immortality but instead embraced it as a tool to help others find their way. And though he missed his mortal friends and family, he was glad that he was where he wanted to be.
