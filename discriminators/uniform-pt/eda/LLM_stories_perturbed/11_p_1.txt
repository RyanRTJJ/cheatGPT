Jacob was a curious boy with a wild imagination. He loved to explore the world around him, but there were some things he just couldn't understand. The concept of death, for instance, was one that left him feeling confused and scared.

One day, Jacob decided to take matters into his own hands. He put on his favorite astronaut costume and declared that he was a space explorer on a mission to find answers to the question that had troubled him. As he donned his helmet and climbed into his makeshift spaceship (a cardboard box with cardboard cut out for windows), he felt a sense of control over the unknown.

With his trusty rocket ship in tow, Jacob set out to explore the mysteries of the universe. He floated through space, planets and stars, marveling at the vastness of it all. As he navigated his way through the cosmos, Jacob came across many other beings, some friendly and others not so much. But no matter what obstacles he faced, Jacob always found a way to use his quick thinking and his faith to overcome them.

In the end, Jacob returned home feeling more informed and empowered than ever before. He knew that he might not have all the answers he was searching he was still in his twenties, he was determined to keep on learning. And whenever he encountered a concept or situation that he couldn't understand, he knew he could always put on his astronaut suit and take to the stars, where he could find a sense of safety and control in the unknown.
