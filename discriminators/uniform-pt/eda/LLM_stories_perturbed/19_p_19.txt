I woke up feeling groggy, on the other side of consciousness. I rubbed my eyes and stretched my arms, trying to shake off the sleepiness. As I walked towards the bathroom, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and did a double take.

My eyes widened as I saw a bright glow emanating from my fingertips. I looked down at my hands, and sure enough my fingertips were emitting a bright, warm light. I tried to shake it off, but the light only grew stronger. I had no idea what was happening to me.

As I went about my morning and found myself at the coffee shop, the lightning power was growing stronger by the minute. My fingertips had the way to create and manipulate light, and I was able to make it brighter or darker as I pleased. It was fascinating, but also a bit overwhelming.

I decided to take a walk to clear my head, but as soon as I stepped outside, I knew something was beyond me. The world was in chaos, with cars overturned and buildings on fire. The residents were running in all directions, screaming and in fear.

It didn't take me long to realize I had been granted this power for a reason. I had the ability to help those in need and bring light to the darkness. I ran towards the nearest burning building and used my powers to create a path of light, guiding people to safety.

As I continued to use my powers to help those around me, I realized that this was my purpose. I had been given it by my Creator, and it was up to me to use it for good. My days were filled with helping others, and I felt a sense of fulfillment and joy that I had never experienced before.

As the sun went down on a chaotic day, I looked up at the sky and felt a sense of gratitude. I didnâ€™t know what tomorrow would bring, but I knew that I was ready to face it with my dreams and purpose.
