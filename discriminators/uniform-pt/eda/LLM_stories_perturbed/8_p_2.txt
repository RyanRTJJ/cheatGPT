As a child, Sarah always felt out of place. She struggled to make friends and took solace in books about the supernatural. It wasn't until her teenage years that she discovered her true nature as a witch, and suddenly everything made sense.

But being a witch wasn't easy. Society didn't accept her, and she was often ostracized . So when Sarah stumbled upon a spell that promised to grant her the power to make anyone love her, she couldn't resist.

The spell worked, but it came with a dark cost. Sarah discovered that the love she had taken was not spontaneous but forced. She had become a puppet master, pulling the strings of people's hearts to suit her . Over the years, she always tried everything in her power to please those around her, always thirsting for more. But as time went on, she began to feel a deep emptiness within her. She realized that true love and intimacy could never be forced, only earned.

Desperate to break the curse she had put on herself, Sarah searched for a way to undo her magic. Her desperate search was frustrated when she discovered the ancient ritual that promised to lift the curse, but only through the loss of an innocent life.

Sarah struggled with the decision for weeks, but ultimately her desire for redemption won out. And so, she lured an unsuspecting woman to join her day Sarah had performed the ritual, watching in horror as the life drained from the eyes before her.

As the veil lifted and Sarah's power faded away, she was overcome with a newfound sense of guilt and shame. She had become the monster she had always feared, and there was no going back.

But despite her regrets, Sarah knew that she had to face the consequences of her actions. And so, she turned herself in to the authorities, ready to face whatever punishment awaited her. For even in the depths of her depravity, she knew that she could never truly escape the horror of what she had done.
