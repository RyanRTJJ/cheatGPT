The first Vice Chancellor, Zaxar, was furious. He had sent his best troops to invade Earth and had given them the most powerful weapons to destroy the puny humans. But now, he was receiving reports that his assault was failing.

"What do you mean you ate our ammunition?" Zaxar bellowed at his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the humans have developed a taste for our weaponry. They've been eating our technology instead of being destroyed by it."

Zaxar's eyes widened . "That's impossible. How can they eat our weapons?"

Gorg cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that these humans have been experimenting with genetically modified crops that can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been feeding these crops to their livestock, and now the humans themselves have developed our own crops for them."

Zaxar rubbed his scaly chin, swaying back in thought. He had not anticipated this development. They had been conquering other planets for centuries, but only recently had they encountered to fight any human that could consume their weapons.

"Very well," Zaxar finally said. "We have to adapt our strategy. Gorg, send me direct instructions to our scientists to develop a new kind of weapon that the humans cannot eat. They will not be defeated by a race of beings who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay was a small planet in small town, yet even the alien overlord couldn't help but feel a sense of grudging respect for the humans. They were resourceful, and their ability to survive was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
