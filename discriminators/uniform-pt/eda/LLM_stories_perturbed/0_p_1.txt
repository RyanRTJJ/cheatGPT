John had always been fascinated with the idea of immortality. He had spent years researching and experimenting in his search for magic, and finally, he had done it. He had discovered the secret to immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the incredible things he could accomplish now that he had all the time and energy in the world. But suddenly, Death appeared before him, handing him a card with a cryptic message. "When you realize living forever sucks, call this number. I have a job offer for you."

John was confused but intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death would offer him a job, but he wanted to keep the card ! Maybe he can find something useful with his newfound immortality.

At first, John was thrilled with his immortality. He traveled the world, learned new skills, and amassed a fortune. But as time went on, John realized that living forever wasn't as wonderful as he had thought it would be.

He watched as his loved ones aged and passed away, leaving him alone in a world that was constantly changing. He saw worlds crumbling around him, disasters that he could do nothing to prevent. He felt like a prisoner in his own body, still dying to escape the cycle of endless days.

It was then that John remembered the business card Death had given him. He decided to call the number, to see what kind of job offer Death could have for an immortal man like himself.

To his surprise, Death answered the phone, his voice calm and reassuring. "I knew you would call eventually," he said. "I have a job offer for you, but I need someone to help me in the afterlife, someone who understands what it's like to live forever."

John couldn't believe what he was hearing. But as Death explained the details of the job, John realized that this was exactly what he had been looking for. He could use his immortality to help others, to guide them through their darkest moments and ensure that they found peace.

And so, John gave Death the job offer and began a new chapter of his endless life. He never felt trapped in his immortality but instead embraced it as a tool to help others find their own. Even though he spent some time missing his mortal friends and family, he knew that he was where he was meant to be.
