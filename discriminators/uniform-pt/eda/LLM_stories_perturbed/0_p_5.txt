John had always been fascinated with the concept of immortality. He had spent years researching and experimenting in his basement laboratory, and finally, he had done it. He had discovered the secret to immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the incredible things he could accomplish now that he had all the time in the world. But suddenly, Death appeared before him, handing him a business card attached to it in the shape of a cryptic message. "When you realize just how much this sucks, call this number. I've got a job offer for you."

John was immediately intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death would offer him a job, but he decided to ignore the card and continue with his newfound immortality.

At first, John was thrilled with his newfound longevity. He traveled the world, learned new skills, and amassed a large savings account. But as time went on, John realized that living forever was not as wonderful as he had thought it would be.

He watched as his loved ones aged and passed on, leaving him alone in a world that was constantly changing. He saw wars and disasters that he could do nothing to stop. He felt like a prisoner in his own body, only wanting to escape the monotony of endless days.

It was then that John remembered the business card Death had given him. He decided to call the number, curious about what kind of job offer Death had for an immortal man like him. Perhaps to John's surprise, Death answered the phone, his voice strong yet reassuring. "I knew you would call eventually," he said. "I have a job offer for you, John. I need someone to help manage the afterlife, someone who understands what it's like to live forever."

John couldn't believe what he was hearing. But as the man explained the details of his job, John realized that this was exactly what he had been looking for. He could finally use his immortality to help others, to guide them through the afterlife and ensure that they found peace.

And so, John accepted the job offer and began a new chapter of his endless life. He no longer felt responsible for his immortality but instead used it as a tool to help his friends who had lost their way. And though he still missed his mortal friends and family, he knew that he was where he was meant to be.
