As the head of NASA, I've always known that the Earth is flat. It's a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few within the federal scientific community.

So when the incoming President asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this a secret is because it could cause mass panic and chaos if the public were to learn the truth," I explained.

"But why would that happen?" The President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would seriously undermine our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics," I said. "It would also raise a lot of questions about our place in the world and our future as a species."

The President nodded thoughtfully. "I understand your point," he said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know the truth?"

I sighed. "Of course they do. But we need to be careful about how we reveal this information. We want to make sure that people understand the implications of what it means for them." The President nodded again, and I could tell he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and sharing this information with me," he said.

As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret from the public for so long, but I knew that we were doing the right thing by keeping the truth hidden for now. Perhaps one day, when humanity is ready, we can reveal the truth and begin to explore the mysteries of this flat Earth.
