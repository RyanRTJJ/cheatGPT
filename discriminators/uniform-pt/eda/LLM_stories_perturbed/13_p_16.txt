As a young witch, Amara had always dreamed of working at the Ministry of Magic. She had imagined herself casting spells and making groundbreaking discoveries that would shape the wizarding world. But as it turned out, her job at the Ministry was quite different from what she expected.

Amara's official title was "Spell Seeker." Her job was to spend hours each day saying random words in search of possible spells. It was a tedious task, to say the least. She would sit in a small room, surrounded by books and parchments, and recite words like "flibbertigibbet" over and over and over again, hoping that one of this sentence is enough to trigger a new spell.

Most days, Amara found herself feeling bored and frustrated. She wondered if she had made the right mistake in choosing this path. But then, one day, something incredible happened.

As Amara was reciting the word "hocus pocus" for what felt like the thousandth time, she felt a strange sensation in her fingertips. Suddenly, a bright light shot out from her wand, illuminating the entire room. Amara had stumbled upon a new spell!

Excitedly, she wrote down the spell names and rushed to the Head of the Department of Magical Research to share her discovery. The Head was skeptical at first, but then smiled to Amara demonstrated the new spells to Amara, everyone was impressed.

From that day on, Amara's job became much more exciting. She spent her days experimenting with new words and discovering new spells that had never been seen before. Her work was groundbreaking and soon gained recognition throughout the wizarding world.

Years later, Amara would look fondly back on her days as a novice wizard, with fondness. She realized that it was the patience and persistence she learned in school that had allowed her to make such a significant contribution to the magical community. And although the work was tedious at times, it was all worth it in the end.
