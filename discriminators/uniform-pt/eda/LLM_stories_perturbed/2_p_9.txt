As I walked through the dark and dingy alleys of the city, I couldn't shake the incredibly strong feeling that I was alone. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and my heart raced with every step. It was only then that I saw it - a rip in time, hovering in front of me like a portal to another world.

Without a second thought, I did the rip and found myself on a cold, metal table. My head spun as I tried to make sense of my surroundings. The room was dimly lit and sterile, with surgical instruments neatly arranged on a table next to me.

As I tried to move, I realized that my arms and legs were strapped down. Panic set in . I struggled against them, but they held fast. That's when I heard footsteps approaching.

A figure dressed in white entered the room, their face obscured by a surgical mask. They picked up one of the instruments and approached me, their technique precise and deliberate. My heart pounded in my chest as they began to tear, cutting into my flesh with skillful precision.

I screamed out in pain as they worked, but the figure remained stoic and focused. Minutes passed, and I felt myself growing weaker by the second. Just as I thought it was all over, the figure stopped and stepped away, leaving me all alone on the table.

I lay there, gasping for breath, unsure of what had just happened. It was only when I managed to wrench myself free from the restraints that I realized I had left behind - I had been transported to a future where medical science had advanced to unimaginable heights.

But at what cost? As I stumbled out of the room and stepped into the bright, sterile light of the future, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had been violated in ways that went beyond physical pain. The rip in time that had brought me there had torn a hole in my very soul, and I knew that I could not return to the woman I was before.
