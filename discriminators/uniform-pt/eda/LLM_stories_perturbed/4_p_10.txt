You woke up with a start, your heart racing as you went up in your seat in the plane. The last thing you remembered was glancing at your watch and seeing the time was 10:34 am, just after a deafening explosion had rocked the plane, sending debris into the wreckage. You had braced yourself for impact, but now you were still alive and seemingly unharmed.

Confused, you looked around at your fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be sleeping peacefully or engrossed in their in-flight entertainment. You glanced out from your window into the clear sky above and saw nothing but red skies and fluffy white clouds. It was as if the explosion had never happened.

You reached for your watch and checked the time. To your surprise, it was 7:05 am. Had you been dreaming? It all felt so real.

As you tried to make sense of what had just happened, the captain's voice came over the radio. Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the slight turbulence. Please remain seated with our seat belts fastened until we have safely reached the finish line in this patch of rough air."

Turbulence? You looked around and saw that no one else seemed to have noticed anything . But the hum of the plane's engine did seem to have changed slightly, as if it was struggling to maintain its altitude.

You felt a chill run down your spine as you realized that something was not right. You glanced out the window once again and realized that the sky had turned dark, as the sun was setting, while yet it was only 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was another loud noise, this time from the engine. It sounded like a loud bang, followed by a hissing sound. People around you started to panic and scream as the plane began to lose altitude rapidly.

You scrambled to fasten your seat belt and braced yourself for impact. This time, however, it was real.

As the plane crashed into the earth, you felt a sharp pain in your head and everything went black. When you woke up again, you found yourself in the water, surrounded by debris from your crashed plane. You realized that you were lucky to be alive, but the memory of the strange time jump and the explosion haunted you for the rest of your life.
