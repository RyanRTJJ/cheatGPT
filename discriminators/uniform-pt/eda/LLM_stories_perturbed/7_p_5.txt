It was beautiful summer sunshine and I decided to take my kids to the park. They were ecstatic and couldn't wait to start playing on the swings and slides. As we arrived, I noticed some dark clouds looming in the distance, but I thought we had plenty of time to get out of the park before the rain hit.

As my kids were playing, I started to notice the telltale signs of a lightning strike. The hair on my arms began to stand up, and the lightning was electrically charged. I immediately knew we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my kids and jogged to the back towards the nearest shelter. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning struck nearby, and I felt an excruciating pain coursing through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my kids crying and calling out my name.

It took me a few moments to realize why this happened. I had been hit by lightning. As I got up, I experienced something strange. My senses were heightened, and I could sense everything around me with incredible accuracy. It was like a sixth sense had awakened within me.

As I drove my kids back to our car, I realized that my Dad Senses had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate every move my kids were about to make, and I could sense danger before it happened. It was like I had become a superhero, with the power to protect my kids from harm.

From that moment on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had always been a protective father, but now I could do much more. I took it to the next level. I could sense when it happened, and I could react before anyone else even knew what was going on. When we got into the car, my kids looked up at me with concern. But I smiled at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's got this. With my Dad there, we'll always be safe."
