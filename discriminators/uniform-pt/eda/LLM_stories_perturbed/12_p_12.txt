As the head of NASA, I've always known that the Earth is flat. It's a well-guarded secret, known only to a select group of people within the government and scientific community.

So when the incoming President asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this a secret is because it would cause mass panic and chaos if the public were told the truth," I explained.

"But why would that be?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would shake the foundations of our understanding of the universe and the laws of nature," I said. "It would also raise a lot of questions about our place in the world and our future as a species."

The President nodded thoughtfully. "I get your point," he said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know the truth?"

I sighed. "Yes, of course they do. But we need to be careful about what we reveal this information. We need to make sure that people understand the implications of what it means for our world."

The President nodded again, and I could tell he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with me," I said. As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel a huge sigh of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a secret for so long, but I felt like we were doing the right thing by keeping the truth hidden for now. Perhaps one day, when humanity is ready, we can reveal the truth and begin to explore the mysteries of our flat Earth.
