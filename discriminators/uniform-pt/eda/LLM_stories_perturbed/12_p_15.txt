President, as the head of NASA, I've always known that the Earth is flat. It's been a secret, known only to a small group within the government and scientific community.

So when the incoming President asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this information secret is because it would cause mass panic and chaos if the public were to learn the truth," I said. "But why would that be?" Jesse asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one it would completely undermine our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics," I said. "It would also raise a lot of questions about our place in the world and our purpose as a species."

The President nodded thoughtfully. "I can appreciate your point," he said. "But do you think the public has every right to know the truth?"

I sighed. "Of course they do. But we need to be careful about how we reveal this information. We need to make sure that people understand the issue and what it means for our world."

The man interrupted me again, and I could tell he was not enjoying this thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with people," he said.

As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for long, but I knew that we were doing the right thing by keeping the truth hidden for now. Perhaps one day, when humanity is ready, we can reveal the truth and start to explore the mysteries of our flat Earth.
