For as long as he could remember, Tyler had always had the same favourite book. In it, he would find himself wandering through a fantastical world filled with strange creatures and towering castles. And every time, he would be joined by a strange girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She never introduced herself, but over time, they became best friends, exploring the dream world together and sharing secrets and stories.

As they grew older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got a job, and started building a life for himself. But he never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and sometimes he would catch himself thinking about her.

One day, while walking through the park, Tyler saw her. The girl from his dreams. She was sitting on a rock looking off into the distance. At first Tyler thought he must be imagining things, but as he got closer, he could see that it was really her. She looked older, and her complexion was darker, but the sparkling eyes and bright smile were still there.

Tyler walked up to her and said hello, but she looked at him with a blank expression, as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, to remind her of their adventures in the past, but she just shook her head and said she had to go.

For weeks, Tyler tried to find her again, but she seemed to be going away. Finally, one day, he managed to catch her alone. He asked her why she was acting so strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at Tyler with sad eyes and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I can't explain it right now. It's a little bit complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more information, but she refused to say anything else. As she walked away, he couldn't help feeling a sense of anger towards Tyler. The girl from his dreams had been real all along, but now she seemed to be slipping away , once again.

For months, Tyler tried to forget about her, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something he was missing. Then, one night, he had a dream. In it, he was back in the fantastical world, and there she was, the girl from his dreams, waiting for him.

As they explored the dream world once again, she finally explained everything to him. She was a bridge between worlds, a guide who helped people navigate the to the multiverse. Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she had been constantly guiding through his dreams. But now that he was an adult, it was time for her to move on to other responsibilities.

Tyler woke up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had finally gotten the answers he had been seeking, though he knew that he could never see her again. As he went about his day, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the time they had shared together, both in his dreams and in the days of reality.
