As I walked through the dark and dingy alleys of the city, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was a zombie. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and my heart raced with every step. It was then that I saw it - a rip in time, hovering in front of him like a portal to another world. Without a second thought, I stepped through the rip and found myself on a cold, metal table. My head spun as I tried to make sense of my surroundings. The room was dimly lit and sterile, with surgical instruments neatly arranged on a table next to me. As I tried to move, I realized that my arms and legs were pinned down. Panic set in as I struggled against the restraints, but they held fast. That's when I heard the footsteps behind me. A dark figure dressed in white entered the room, their face obscured by a surgical mask. They picked up one of their instruments and approached me, their movements precise and deliberate. My heart pounded in my chest as they began to make incisions, cutting into my flesh with skillful precision.

I screamed out in agony as they worked, but each figure remained stoic and focused. Minutes passed, and I found myself growing weaker by the second. Just as I thought it was all over, the figure stopped and stepped away, leaving the body bleeding and alone on the table.

I lay there, gasping for breath, unsure of what had just happened. It was only a moment later that I managed to wrench myself free from the restraints that I realized the truth - I had been transported to a future where medical science had advanced to unimaginable heights.

But at what cost? As I stumbled out of the room into the bright, sterile light of the future, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had been violated in another way that went beyond what the law of nature permitted. The rip in time that had brought me there had torn a deep hole in my very soul, and I knew that I could never truly return to the life I had known before.
