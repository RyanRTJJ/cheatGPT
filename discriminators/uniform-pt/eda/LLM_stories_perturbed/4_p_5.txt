You woke up with a start, your head spinning as you sat up in your seat on the plane. The last thing you remembered was glancing at your watch to read the time : 11:00 am, just before a deafening explosion had rocked the plane, sending debris flying everywhere. You had done nothing for impact, yet you were still alive and seemingly unharmed.

Confused, you looked around for any evidence of your fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be sleeping peacefully or engrossed in their in-flight entertainment. Finally you looked out the window and saw nothing but blue skies and fluffy white clouds. It was as if the explosion had never happened.

You reached for your watch and checked the time. To your surprise, it was 1:00 am. Had you been dreaming? It all felt so real.

As you tried to make sense of what had just happened, the captain's voice came over the intercom. "Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the slight turbulence. Please remain seated with your seat belts until we have safely cleared this patch of rough air."

Turbulence? You looked around and noticed that no one else seemed to have noticed anything , but the hum of the plane's engine did seem to have changed slightly, as if it was struggling to maintain altitude.

You felt a chill run down your spine as you realized that something was not right. You looked out the window and saw that the sky had turned dark, almost like it was nighttime. But it was only 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was another loud noise, this time from the engine. It was a loud bang, followed by a loud bang. People around you started to cry and scream as the plane began to lose altitude . You reached the wall to fasten your seat belt and braced yourself for impact. This time, you knew it was real.

As the plane crashed into the ocean, you felt a thud in your head and everything went black. When you woke up again, you were floating in the water, surrounded by debris from the plane. You realized that you were lucky to survive, but the memory of the forced jump and the explosion haunted you for the rest of your life.
