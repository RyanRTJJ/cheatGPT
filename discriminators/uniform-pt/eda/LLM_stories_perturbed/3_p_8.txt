For as long as he could remember, Tyler had always had the same dream. In it, he would find himself wandering through a world filled with strange creatures and towering castles. And in this dream he would be joined by a strange girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She Tyler for herself, but over time, they became close friends, traveling the dream world together and sharing secrets . As Tyler grew older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got a job, and started building a life for himself. But he never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and sometimes he would catch himself daydreaming about her.

One day, while walking through the park, he remembered her. Apparently from his dreams. She was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he must be imagining things, but as he got closer, he could see that it was really her. She looked older, of course, but those sparkling eyes and mischievous smile were still there.

Tyler walked up to her and tried to approach her, but she just looked at him with a blank expression, as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding her of their fight in the dream world, but she just shook her head and said she had to go.

For weeks, he tried to find her again, but she seemed to be avoiding him. Finally, one day, he managed to catch her. He asked her why she was feeling strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him with sad eyes and said, "I remember you, but I can't explain it right now. It's too complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more questions, but she refused to say anything else. As she walked away, he couldn't shake a sense of loss. The girl from his dreams had been real all along, but now she seemed to be away from him once again.

For months, Tyler tried to forget about her, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something important he was missing. Then, one night, he had a dream. In it, he was back in the city, ready to find his love, and there she was, the same woman from his dreams, waiting for him.

As he entered the dream world once again, she finally explained everything to him. She was a traveler between worlds, a guide who helped people navigate the complexities of the multiverse. Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she had been raising and guiding through the years. But now that he was an adult, it was time for her to move on to other responsibilities.

Tyler woke up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had finally gotten the answers he had been seeking, but he knew he would never see her again. As he went about his day he couldn't help but feel grateful for the time they had shared together, both in his dreams and in brief moments of reality.
