You woke up with a start, your heart racing as you sat up in your seat on the plane. The only thing you remembered was glancing at your watch and seeing that the time was 10:34 am, just before a deafening explosion had rocked the plane, sending flying debris everywhere. You had braced yourself for Only now you were still alive and seemingly unharmed.

Confused, you looked around at your fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be sleeping peacefully or engrossed in their in-flight entertainment. You glanced out the window and saw nothing but blue sky and fluffy white clouds. It was as if the explosion had never happened.

You reached for your watch and checked the time. To your surprise, it was 5:35 am. Had you been dreaming? It all felt so real.

As you tried to make sense of what had just happened, the captain's voice came over the intercom. "Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the turbulence. Please remain seated with our belts fastened until we have safely passed through this patch of bad weather." You looked around and realised no one else seemed to have noticed anything unusual. But the hum of the plane's engine did seem to have changed slightly, as if it was trying to maintain altitude.

You felt a chill run down your spine and you realized that something was not right. You glanced out the window again and saw that the sky had turned dark, as if it was nighttime. But it was only 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was another loud noise, this time from the engine. It sounded like a loud bang, followed by a hissing sound. People around you started to panic and scream as the plane began to lose altitude rapidly.

You scrambled to tighten your seat belt and braced yourself for a landing. This time, you knew it was real.

As the plane crashed into the ocean, there was a sharp flash in your head and everything went black. When you woke up again, you were floating in the water, surrounded by debris from the plane. You didnâ€™t think you were lucky to be alive, but the memory of the strange landing and the explosion haunted you for the rest of your life.
