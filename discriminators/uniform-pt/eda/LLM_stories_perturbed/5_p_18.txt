Jenna had always been fascinated by blacksmithing. As a child, she loved watching her father work the forge, turning metal into beautiful, intricate shapes. But when she expressed an interest in learning to work the knife herself, he had scoffed.

"Blacksmithing is not for women," he said. "It's a man's job."

Jenna didn't care. She knew she had what it took to be a blacksmith. And so, when she turned 19 she left home and traveled to the nearest city, where she found work as an apprentice to a master blacksmith.

The work was hard, of course, but Jenna loved it. She learned how to work and shape iron with the hammer and anvil, to create beautiful pieces of art from nothing but raw materials. She learned to work with flame, using it to heat the metal to just the right temperature to work it with her hands. Over the years, Jenna honed her skills, becoming one of the best blacksmiths in the city. People came from all around to commission her to create beautiful pieces for them. She crafted everything from simple hooks and arrows to elaborate swords and armor.

One day, a wealthy merchant approached Jenna with a special request. He wanted her to create a set of iron gates for his mansion, gates that would be both beautiful and strong enough to keep out unwanted guests.

Jenna accepted the request and set to work. For weeks, she toiled over them, heating the steel in the forge and shaping it with her hammer. She used every trick she had learned over the years, working the process with great precision and care.

When she finished, the gates were a masterpiece. They were strong and sturdy, yet delicate and beautiful at the same time. The King was thrilled honoured her and paid Jenna handsomely for her work.

As Jenna watched the grill being installed at the mansion, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. Through iron and flame, she had created something of value. And she knew that she had proved her father wrong - blacksmithing was not just a man's job.
