You woke up with a start, your heart racing as you sat up in your seat on the plane. The last thing you remembered was the clock on your iPhone, seeing the time was 10:34 am, just before a deafening explosion had rocked the plane, sending debris flying everywhere. When you left that moment behind, you braced yourself for impact, but now you were still alive and seemingly unharmed.

Confused, you looked over at your fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be sleeping or engrossed in their in-flight entertainment. In a moment, you looked out the window and saw nothing but blue sky and fluffy white clouds. It was as if the explosion had never happened.

You reached for your watch and checked the time. To your surprise, it read 9:35 am. Had you been dreaming? It felt so real.

As you tried to make sense of what had just happened, a soothing voice addressed you from across the room. Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the slight turbulence. Please remain seated with your seat belts on. "At last we have safely passed through this patch of rough air."

Turbulence? You looked around and saw that no one else seemed to have noticed anything unusual. But the hum of the plane's engine did seem to have changed slightly, as if the plane was struggling to maintain altitude.

You felt a chill run down your spine as you realized that something was not right. You glanced out the window and saw that the moon had appeared over the horizon as if it was nighttime. But it was only 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was another loud noise, this time from the engine. It sounded like a loud bang, followed by a hissing sound. People around you began to panic and scream as the plane began to lose altitude rapidly.

You scrambled to fasten your seat belt and braced yourself for impact. This time, you knew it was real.

As the plane crashed into the ocean, you felt a pain in your head and everything went completely still. When you woke up again, you were floating in the water, surrounded by debris from the plane. You realized that you were lucky to be alive, but the memory of the strange time jump and the explosion haunted you for the rest of your life.
