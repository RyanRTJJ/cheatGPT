in head of the press today. "We've always known that the Earth is flat. It's a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few in the government and scientific community.

So when the incoming President asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this a secret is because it would cause shock and chaos if the public were to learn the truth," I explained.

"But why would that be?" the kid asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would completely change our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics," I said. "It would raises a lot of questions about our place in the world and our purpose as a species."

The President nodded thoughtfully. "I see your point," he said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know the truth?" "Yes, of course they do. But we need to be careful about how we reveal this information. We need to make sure that people understand the implications of what it means for our world."

The President nodded again, and I could tell he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with us," he said.

As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for so long, but I knew we were all doing the right thing by keeping the truth a secret for now. Perhaps one day, when we are all ready, we can reveal the truth and begin to explore the mysteries of our flat Earth.
