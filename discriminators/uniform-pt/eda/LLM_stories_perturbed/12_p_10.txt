As the head of NASA, I've always known that the Earth is actually a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few members of the nation's scientific community.

So when the incoming President asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this a secret is because it would cause mass panic and chaos if the public were to be told the truth," I explained.

"But why would that be?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would dramatically alter our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics," I said. "It would also raise a lot of questions about our place in the world and our purpose as a species."

The President nodded thoughtfully. "I see your point," he said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know the truth?"

I sighed. "Yes, of course they do. But I think we also need to be clear about how we reveal this information. We need to make sure people understand the implications of what it means for our world."

The President nodded again, and I could see he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your patience and for sharing this information with me," he said. As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It was not easy keeping the Big Bang the big secret for so long, but I knew that we were doing the right thing by keeping the truth hidden for now. Perhaps one day, when humanity is ready, we can reveal ourselves to the world and begin to explore the mysteries of our flat Earth.
