It was a beautiful summer day, and I decided to take my kids to the park. They were ecstatic and couldn't wait to start playing on the swings . As we arrived, I noticed some dark clouds looming in the distance, so I thought we had plenty of time to enjoy the park before the rain hit.

As my kids were playing, I started to notice the signs of thunder strike. The hair on my arms began to stand up, and the air felt electrically charged. I immediately knew we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my kids and ran to the nearest shelter. As we reached the moment a bolt of lightning struck nearby, and I felt an excruciating pain coursing through my stomach. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my kids crying and calling out my name. It took me a few minutes to realize what had happened. I had been hit by lightning. As I got up, I noticed something strange. My senses were so incredible! I could sense everything around me with incredible accuracy. It was like a quantum field had been activated within me.

As I walked with my kids back to our home, I realized that my Dad Senses had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate every move my kids were about to make, and I could sense that when it happened. It was like I had become a god with the power to protect my kids from harm.

From that day on, I felt like I had been given a special gift. I had always been a protective father, but now I could take it to the next level. I could sense danger before it happened, and I could react before anyone else even realized what was happening. When we walked home from the car, my kids looked up at me with concern. But I looked at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's got this. With my Dad Senses, we'll always be safe."
