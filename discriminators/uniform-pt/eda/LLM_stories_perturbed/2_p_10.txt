As I walked through the dark and dingy alleys of the city, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and my heart raced with every step. It was then that I saw it - a woman. With a look over her shoulder this time, hovering in front of me like a portal to another world.

Without a second thought, I stepped through the portal and found myself on a cold, metal table. My head spun as I tried to make sense of my surroundings. The table was dimly lit , with surgical instruments neatly arranged on a table next to me. I tried to grab one side, but realized that my arms and legs were tied down. Panic set in as I struggled against the restraints, but they held fast. That's when I heard the footsteps approaching.

A figure dressed in white entered the room, their face obscured by a surgical mask. They picked up one of the instruments and approached me, their movements precise and deliberate. My heart raced through my chest as they began to make incisions, cutting into my flesh with skillful precision.

I screamed out in agony as they worked, but the figure heads seemed calm and focused. breathing, and feeling myself growing weaker by the second. Just as I thought it was all over, the figure stopped and stepped away, leaving me bleeding and alone on the table.

I lay there, gasping for breath, unsure of what had just happened. It was only when I managed to wrench myself free of my physical restraints that I realized the truth : I had been transported to a future where medical science had advanced to unimaginable heights.

But at what cost? As I stumbled out of the room and into the bright, sterile light of the future, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had been violated in ways that went beyond physical pain. The rip in time that had brought me there had torn a hole in my very soul. I knew I could never return to the life I had known before.
