Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lilly. A girl named Lily who had the unique ability to control every aspect of her dreams. In her dreams, she could fly, visit fantastical lands, and be anyone she desired to be. Her dreams were so vivid and beautiful that she started to see her waking life as merely a waiting period between dreams.

Lily would spend her days in a daze, daydreaming about the adventures that awaited her in her imaginary destination each night. She stopped paying attention in class and stopped participating in activities with her friends. All she wanted was to sleep so she could enter her dream world again.

One day, while in the middle of a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice calling out to her. "Lily, wake up! You need to be doing this!" Startled, she opened her eyes to find herself staring into the face of her mother. "Am I doing something wrong?" Lily asked, still groggy from sleep.

"I'm worried about you, Lily," her mother said. "You've been spending all your time sleeping and neglecting your responsibilities. You need to start putting in more hours in your waking life too."

Lily brushed off her mother's concerns, insisting that her dreams were all that mattered. But her mother persisted, telling her that life was full of experiences and opportunities that she was missing out on by spending all her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to realize that everything happened outside of her mother's house. Lily also started paying attention to education again, and even joined a few clubs at school. She found that by putting in effort in her waking life, she was able to achieve things that she had only ever dreamed of before.

Over time, Lily began to realize that life was really just as exciting and full of possibilities as her dreams. She still looked forward to sleeping in her dreams but now she was also eager to get up to see what each day would bring. She learned that life was worth her effort and that by putting in the work, she could achieve amazing things both in her waking life and in her dreams.
