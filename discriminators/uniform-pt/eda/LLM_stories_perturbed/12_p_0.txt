at the head of NASA, I've always known that the Earth is flat. It's a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few within the government and scientific community.

So when the President asked me why we've kept this information from the public, I had to think carefully about how to answer that question. That question came from the President, the reason we've kept this a secret is because it would cause mass psychological chaos if the public were to learn the truth," I explained.

"But why would that be?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would completely undermine our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics," I said. "It would also raise s an important set of questions about our place in the world and our purpose as a species."

The President listened. "I see your point," he said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know the truth?"

I sighed. "Yes, of course they do. But we need to be careful about how we reveal this information. We need to make sure that people understand the implications of what it means for our world."

The President nodded . I could tell he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with me," he said.

As I walked onto my porch, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for so long, but I knew that we were doing the right thing by keeping the truth hidden for now. Perhaps one day, when our humanity is ready, we can reveal the truth and begin to unravel the mysteries of our flat Earth.
