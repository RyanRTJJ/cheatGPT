It was a beautiful summer day, and I decided to take my boys to the park. They were ecstatic and couldn't wait to start playing on the swings and slides. As we arrived, I noticed some dark clouds looming in the sky, but I thought we had plenty of time to enjoy their fun before the rain hit.

As my kids were playing, I started to notice the telltale signs of a lightning strike. The hair on my arms began to stand up and the air felt damp. I immediately knew that we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my kids and ran towards the nearest shelter. As we reached the shelter, a flash of lightning struck nearby, and I felt an excruciating pain coursing through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my son and his wife crying and calling out my name.

It took me a few moments to realize what had happened. I had been struck by lightning. As I got up, I noticed something special about me. My senses were heightened, and I could sense everything around me with incredible accuracy. It was like a sixth sense had been activated within me.

As I drove my kids back to their car, I realized that my Dad Senses had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate every move my kids were about to make, so I could sense danger before it happened. It was like I had become a second father: I had the power to protect my kids from harm.

From that day on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had always been a protective father, but now I could take it to the next level. I knew the danger before it happened, and I had the ability to react before anyone else even knew what was going on.

As we got into the car, my kids looked up at me with concern. But I smiled at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's got this. With my Dad Senses, we'll always be safe."
