John had always been fascinated by the idea of immortality. He had spent years researching and experimenting in his basement on the moon and finally, he had done it. He had found the secret to immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the incredible things he could accomplish now that he was completely unrestrained by all the time in the world. But suddenly, Death appeared before him, holding out a business card with a cryptic message. "Hi, I realize living forever sucks, call this number. I've got a job offer for ..." Death was confused but intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death would offer him a job, but he decided to accept this business card and continue with his newfound immortality.

At first, John was thrilled with his newfound longevity. He traveled the world, learned new skills, and made a fortune. But as time went on, John found that living forever wasn't as wonderful as he had imagined. He would need to live with another living person as his loved ones aged and passed away, leaving him alone in a world that was constantly changing. He saw wars and disasters that he could do nothing to prevent. He felt like a prisoner in his own body, unable to escape the monotony of endless days.

It was then that John remembered the business card Death had given him. He decided to call it, curious to see what kind of job offer Death could have wished for an immortal man like himself.

To his surprise, Death answered the phone, his voice calm and firm. "I just knew you would call eventually," he said. "I have a job offer for you, John. I need someone to help me manage the monsters who know what it's like to live forever."

John had not seen what he was hearing. But as Death explained the details of the job, John realized that this was exactly what he had been looking for. He needed to use his immortality to help others, to guide them through the afterlife and stay there until they found peace.

And so, John accepted the job offer and began a new chapter of his endless life. He no longer felt trapped in his immortality but instead embraced it as a tool to help others find their way. And though he still had his mortal friends and family, he knew that he was where he was meant to be.
