As the official who runs NASA, I've always known that the Earth is flat. But it is a well-guarded secret, known only to a lucky few within the government and scientific community.

So when the incoming President asked me why we've kept this information from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this a secret is it would cause mass panic and chaos if the public were to learn the truth," I said. "And why would that be?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would completely undermine our understanding of the universe -- the laws of physics," I said. "It would also raise a lot of questions about our place in the world and our purpose as a species."

The President was skeptical. "I see your point," he said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know the truth?"

I sighed. "Yes, of course they do. But we need to be careful with what we reveal this information. We need to make sure that people understand the implications of what it means for their lives and our world."

The President nodded again, and I could tell he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing your deep thoughts with me," he said.

As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for so long, but I knew that we were doing the right thing by keeping the truth hidden for now. Perhaps , when humanity is ready, we will finally learn the truth and begin to explore the mysteries of our flat Earth.
