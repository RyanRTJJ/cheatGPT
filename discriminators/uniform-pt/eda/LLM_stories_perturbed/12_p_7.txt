As the Director of NASA, I've always known that the Earth is flat. It's a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few within the government and scientific communities. But when the incoming President asked me why these scientists have kept this information from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this a secret is because it would cause mass panic and chaos if the public were to learn ," I explained.

"But why would that cause panic and chaos?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would completely undermine our understanding of the cosmos and the laws of physics," I said. "It would also raise s a number of questions about our place in the world and our purpose as a public." The President nodded thoughtfully. "I see your point," he said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know more about the truth?"

I sighed. "Yes, of course they do." "But we need to be careful about how we reveal this information. We need to make sure that people understand the implications of what it means for security in our world."

The President nodded again, and I could see he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with me," he said.

As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for so long, but I know we were doing the right thing by keeping the truth hidden . Perhaps one day, when humanity is finally awakening, we can reveal the truth and begin to explore the mysteries of our flat Earth.
