It was a beautiful summer day, and I decided to take my kids to the park. They were ecstatic and couldnâ€™t wait to start playing on the swings and slides. As we arrived, I noticed some dark clouds looming in the distance, but I thought we had plenty of time to enjoy the park before the rain hit.

As my kids were playing, I started to notice the telltale signs of a lightning strike. The hair on my arms started to stand up, and the air felt electrically charged. I immediately knew we had to get outta there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my kids and we headed for the nearest shelter. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning struck my neck and chest. Suddenly, I felt an excruciating pain coursing through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my kids crying and calling out in pain. It took me several moments to realize what had happened. I had been hit by lightning. As I got up, I noticed something strange. My senses were activated and I could sense everything around me with an amazing accuracy. It was like a sixth sense had been activated within me.

As I was walking my kids back to our car, I realized that my Dad Senses had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate every move my kids were about to make, and I could sense when it happened. It felt like I had become a superhero, with the power to protect my kids from all the dangers before them. From that day on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had always been a super girl, but now I could take it to the next level. I could sense danger before it happened, and I could react before anyone else even knew this was going on. When I got into the car, my kids looked up at me with a blank look. I smiled at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's got this. With my Dad Senses, we'll stay safe."
