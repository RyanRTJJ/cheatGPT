It was a beautiful day in Nashville, and I decided to take my kids to the park. They were ecstatic and couldn't wait to start playing on the swings and running through the playground. As we walked I noticed some dark clouds looming in the distance, but I thought we had plenty of time to enjoy the park before the rain hit.

As my kids were playing, I started to notice the telltale signs of a lightning strike. The hair on my arms began to tingle and the air felt electrically charged. I immediately realized that we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my kids and ran towards the nearest shelter. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning appeared nearby, and I felt an excruciating pain through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my kids crying and calling out my name.

It took me a good long while to realize what had happened. I had been hit by lightning. As I got up, I noticed something strange. My senses were heightened, and I could sense everything around me with incredible accuracy. It was like a sixth sense had been activated within me.

As I walked with my kids back to my office back then, I noticed something different in my Dad Senses had been expanded three fold. I could anticipate every move my was about to make, and I could see it before it happened. It was like I had become a superhero, with the power to protect my kids from harm.

From that day on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had always been a protective father, but now I could take it to the next level. I could sense danger before it began, and I could react before anyone else even knew what was going on.

As we got into the car, my friends looked up at me with concern. But I smiled at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's got Dad Senses." "With my Dad Senses, we'll always be safe."
