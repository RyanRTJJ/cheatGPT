As the head of the government, I've been told repeatedly that the Earth is flat. It's a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few within the government and within academia. So when the incoming President asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this a secret is because it would cause mass panic and chaos if the public were to learn the truth," I explained.

"But why would that be?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would completely alter our basic understanding of the universe and the laws of physics," I said. "It would also raise a lot of questions about our position in the world and who we act as ." The President nodded thoughtfully. "I see your point," he said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know the truth?"

I sighed. "Yes, of course they do. But we need to be careful about how we reveal this information. We need to make sure that people understand the implications of what this is doing for our world."

The President looked stunned, and I could tell he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with me," he said. As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for so long, but I knew that we were doing the good thing by keeping the truth hidden for now. One day, when humanity is ready, we can reveal the truth and begin to uncover the mysteries of our flat Earth.
