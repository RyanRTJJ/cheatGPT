It was a beautiful summer day, and I decided to take my kids to the water park. They were ecstatic and couldn't wait to start playing on the swings and slides. As we arrived, I noticed the dark clouds looming in the distance, but I thought we had plenty of time to enjoy the park before the rain hit.

As my four kids were playing, I started to notice the telltale signs of a lightning strike. The hair on my arms began to stand up, and the air felt electrically charged. I immediately knew we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I packed up the kids and ran towards the nearest shelter. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning was nearby, and I felt an excruciating pain rush through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my kids crying and calling out my name. It took me a few moments to realize what had happened. I had been hit by lightning. As I got up, I noticed something different about me. My senses were heightened, and I could sense everything around me with incredible accuracy. It was like a sixth sense had been activated within me.

As I walked with my kids back to our car, I noticed how my Dad Senses had increased 100 fold. I could feel and physically move my kids were aware of any sounds my kids might make, and I could sense danger before it happened. It was like I had become a superhero, with the power to protect my kids from harm.

From that day on I knew I had to become a superhero. I had always been a protective father, but now I could take it to the next level. I could sense it when it happened, and I could react before anyone else realized what was going on.

As we got out of the house and went into the car, my kids looked up at me with concern. But I smiled at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's here for us. With my Dad Senses, we'll always be safe."
