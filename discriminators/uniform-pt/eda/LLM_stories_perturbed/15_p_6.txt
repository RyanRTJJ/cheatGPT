The alien overlord, Zaxar, was furious. He had sent his best troops to assault the hostile Earth and had given them the most advanced weapons to destroy the puny humans. But now, he was receiving reports that their assault was failing.

"What do you mean they had no ammunition?" Zaxar bellowed to his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the humans have developed a taste for our weapons, sir. They've been enjoying it instead of being destroyed by it."

Zaxar's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's impossible. How can they eat our weapons?"

Gorg cleared his throat . "It appears that we have been experimenting with genetically modified crops that can make material, including metal. They've been feeding these crops to their livestock, and now the humans themselves have developed a taste for them."

Zaxar rubbed his chin, not fully sure what to make of this thought. He had not anticipated this development. The human race had been conquering other planets for centuries, and never had they encountered in their plans against living enemies that could consume their weapons.

"Very well," Zaxar finally said. "We have to adapt our strategy. We must send a message to our scientists to develop a new kind of weapon : one metal humans cannot eat. We will not be defeated by a race of beings who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's orders, the alien overlord couldn't help but feel a sense of grudging respect for the humans. They were resourceful, and their determination to survive was immense. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious no matter what it took.
