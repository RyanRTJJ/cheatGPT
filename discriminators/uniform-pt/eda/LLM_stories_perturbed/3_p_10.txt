For as long as he could remember, Tyler had always had the same recurring dream. In it, he would find himself wandering through a fantastical world filled with strange creatures and towering castles. And there, he would be greeted by a strange girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She for herself, but over time, they became close friends, exploring the dream with her and sharing secrets and stories.

As Tyler grew older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of life. He went to college, got a job, and started building a life for himself. But he never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and sometimes he would catch himself daydreaming about her.

One day, after strolling through the park, Tyler saw her. The girl from his dreams. She was sitting on a bench, watching the park fade into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he must be imagining things, but as he got closer, he could see that it was really her. She 'd changed of course, but the sparkling eyes and cute smile were still there. He went up to her and said hello, but she just looked at him with a blank expression, as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding her of their adventures in the dream world, but she just shook her head and said she had to go.

For weeks, Tyler tried to find her again, but she seemed to be disappearing. Finally, one day, he managed to catch her alone. He asked her why she was acting so strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him with sad eyes and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I cannot explain it right now. It sounds too complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more information, but she refused to say anything. As she walked away, he couldn't help feeling a sense of sadness. The girl from his dream had been real all along, but now she seemed to be slipping away from him . For months, Tyler tried to forget about her, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something important he was missing. Then, one night, he had a dream. In it, he was back in the fantastical world, and there was Isabel, the girl from his dreams, waiting for him.

As they explored the dream world once again, she finally explained herself to him. She was a traveler between worlds, a guide , helping different people navigate the complexities of the multiverse. Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she had had tasked with guiding through his dreams. But now that he was an adult, it was time for her to move on to other responsibilities.

Tyler woke up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had finally gotten the answers he had been seeking, but he knew he would never see her again. As he went about his day, he could not help but feel grateful for the times they had shared together, both in his dreams and in the brief moments of reality.
