The alien overlord, Zaxar, was furious. He had sent his best troops to invade Earth and had given them the most advanced weapons to destroy the planet. But now he was receiving reports that his plan was failing.

"What do you mean they ate our ammunition?" Zaxar bellowed at his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the humans have developed a taste for our weaponry, sir. They've been consuming it instead of being destroyed by it."

Zaxar's eyes widened in surprise. "That's impossible. How can they eat it?" Zaxar cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that the humans have been experimenting with genetically modified crops that can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been feeding these crops to their livestock, and now the humans themselves have developed a taste for them."

Zaxar rubbed his scaly chin, deep in thought. He had not known of any such development. His fleet had been circling the planets for centuries, and had been learning as they encountered a species that could consume their weapons.

"Very well," Zaxar declared, "We will need to adapt our strategy. Gorg, send a message to our scientists to develop a different type of weapon that our enemies cannot eat. We will not be eaten by a race of beings who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's orders, the alien overlord couldn't help but feel a sense of grudging respect for the humans. They were tenacious creatures, and their determination to defeat their foes was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
