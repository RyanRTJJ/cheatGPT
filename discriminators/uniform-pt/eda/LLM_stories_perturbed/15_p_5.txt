His overlord, Zaxar, was furious. He had sent his best troops to invade Earth and had given them the raw weapons to destroy the puny humans. But now, he was receiving reports that their assault was failing.

"What do you mean you're wasting our ammunition?" Zaxar bellowed at his overlord, who shifted uncomfortably under his gaze. "It seems that the humans have developed a taste for our weaponry, and have been consuming it instead of being destroyed ." Gorg's eyes widened in confusion. "It seems impossible. How can they eat our weapons?"

Gorg cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that the humans have been experimenting with genetically modified crops that can be processed into various kinds of material, including metal. They've been feeding these crops to the humans, and now the humans themselves have developed more foods for them."

Zaxar rubbed his scaly chin, deep in thought. He had not anticipated this development. His fleet had been conquering other planets for centuries, and never had this technology encountered a species that could consume their weapons.

"Very well," Zaxar finally confirmed, "we will need to adapt our strategy. Gorg, send a message to our scientists to develop a new kind of weapon that the humans can't use. We won't be defeated by a race of people who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's fervent hatred for his alien overlord couldn't help but inspire a deep sense of grudging respect for the humans. They were resourceful, and their determination to thrive was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
