As the head of NASA, I've always known that the Earth is flat. It's a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few within the scientific and scientific community.

So when the incoming President asked me about how NASA kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this a secret is because it would cause mass moral chaos if the public were to learn the truth," I explained.

"But why would that happen?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would completely undermine our understanding of the Universe and the laws of physics," I explained and paused. "It would raises a lot of questions about our standing in the world , and about what we do and our purpose as a species."

The President nodded thoughtfully. "I see ," he said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know the truth?"

I sighed. "Yes, of course they do. But we need to be careful about how we reveal this information, and you need to make sure that people understand the truth, and what it means for our country." He nodded again, and I could tell that he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with me," he said.

As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for so long, but it felt good to know that we were doing the right thing by keeping the truth hidden for now. Perhaps one day, when the Time is ready, we can reveal the truth and begin to explore the mysteries of the flat Earth.
