Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily who had the unique ability to control every aspect of her life through her dreams. In her dreams, she could fly, visit fantastical lands, and be anyone she wanted to be. Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she started to view everyday life as merely a waiting period between dreams.

Lily would spend her days in a daze, unaware of what the world awaited her in her next dream. She stopped paying attention in class and stopped participating in activities with friends. All she wanted was to sleep so she could enter the world again.

One day, while in the middle of a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice calling out to her. "Lily, wake up! You need to hear this!" Startled, she opened her eyes and found herself staring into the concerned face of her mother. "What the hell is wrong?" Lily asked, struggling to wake from sleep.

"I'm worried about you, Lily," her mother said. "You've been spending too much time sleeping and neglecting your responsibilities. You need to start putting in effort into your waking life so that you can enjoy it. Lily shrugged off her mother's concerns, insisting that her sleep was all that mattered. But her mother persisted, telling her that life was full of experiences and opportunities that she was missing out on by spending all of her time asleep.

Slowly , Lily began to see her mother's point. She started paying attention in class again, and even joined a few clubs at school. She found that by putting herself first in her waking life, she was able to achieve things that she had only ever dreamed of before.

Over time, Lily began to realize that life was just as exciting and full of possibilities for her as her dreams. Originally, she looked forward to sleeping and dreaming about how she would manifest her dreams, but now she was also eager to see what each day would bring. She learned that life was worth her time and that by putting in the work, she could accomplish some truly amazing things both in her waking life and in her dreams.
