As a child, Sarah always felt out of place. She struggled to make friends and often found solace in books about monsters and witches. It wasn't until her teenage years that she discovered her true nature as a witch, and suddenly everything made sense.

But being a witch wasn't easy. Sarah had no friends to accept her, and she was often ostracized and bullied. So when she stumbled upon a spell that would give her the power to make anyone love her, she couldn't resist.

The spell worked, but it came with a dark cost. Sarah discovered that the love she received was not genuine, was fake, and had no connection to her. She had become a puppet master, pulling the strings of people's hearts to suit her own . Sarah used her power to manipulate those around her, always thirsting for more. But as time went on, she began to feel a deep emptiness within her. She realized that true love for herself could never be discovered, but only earned.

Desperate to break the curse she had put on herself, Sarah searched for a way to undo the curse. And that's when she discovered the ancient ritual that promised to lift the curse, but only through the sacrifice of an innocent life.

Sarah struggled with the decision for weeks, but ultimately made the decision for redemption . And so, that night Sarah would sacrifice an unsuspecting victim to her home and performed her task, watching in horror as the life drained from the innocent young girl she turned away from her.

As the curse was lifted and Sarah's power faded away, she was left with a newfound sense of regret and shame. She had become the monster she had always feared, and there was no going back.

But despite her regrets, Sarah knew that she had to face the consequences of her actions. And so she turned herself in to the authorities, ready for whatever punishment she deserved. For even in the depths of her depravity, she knew that she could never truly escape the horror of what she had done.
