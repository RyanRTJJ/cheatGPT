It was a beautiful summer day, and I decided to take my kids to the park. They were ecstatic about the weather and couldnâ€™t wait to start playing on the playground and slides. As we arrived, I noticed some dark clouds looming in the distance, but I thought we had plenty of time to enjoy the heat before the rain hit.

As my kids were playing, I started to notice the telltale signs of a storm. The hair on my neck began to stand up, and the air felt electrically charged. I immediately knew we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my kids and started walking towards the nearest shelter. As we reached when a bolt of lightning struck nearby, and I felt an excruciating pain deep in my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my kids crying and calling out my name.

It took me a few moments to realize what had happened. I had been hit by lightning. As I got up, I felt something strange. My senses were heightened, and I could sense everything around me with incredible accuracy. It was like a sixth sense was suddenly activated within me.

As I walked with my kids back to the car, I realized that my Dad Senses had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate every move my kids were about to make, and I could stop it before it happened. It was like I had become a superhero, with the power to protect my kids from harm.

From that day on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had always been a protective father, but now I could take it to the next level. I could tell everything before it happened, and I could react before anyone else even knew what was going on.

As we got into the car, my kids looked at me with concern. But I smiled at them and said, "Don't worry. I got this. With my Dad Senses, we'll always be safe."
