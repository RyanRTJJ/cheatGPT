You woke up with a start, but your blood was already racing as you sat up in your seat on the plane. The last thing you remembered was glancing at your watch and seeing the time was 10:34 am, just before a deafening explosion had rocked the plane, sending a deluge of dust everywhere. You could have braced yourself for impact, but now you were still alive and seemingly unharmed.

Confused, you looked around at your fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be asleep or engrossed in their in-flight entertainment. When you looked out the window, you saw nothing but blue sky and fluffy white clouds. It was as if the explosion had never happened.

You pulled out your watch and checked the time. To your surprise, it had read 9:35 am. Had you been dreaming? It all felt so real.

As you tried to make sense of what had just happened, a voice came over the intercom. "Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the slight turbulence. Please remain seated with our seat belts fastened until we have safely passed through this patch of rough air."

Turbulence? You looked around and around but no one else seemed to have noticed anything unusual. But the hum of the plane's engine did seem to have changed slightly, as if it was struggling to keep its altitude.

You felt a chill run down your spine as you realized that something was not right. You looked out the window again and saw that the sky had turned dark, as if it was nighttime. But it was still 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was another loud noise, a noise coming from the engine. It sounded like a loud bang, followed by a hissing sound. People around you started to cry and as the engines died, the plane began to lose altitude rapidly.

You scrambled to fasten your seat belt and braced yourself for impact. This time, you knew it was real.

As the plane crashed into the ocean, you felt a sharp pain in your head and everything went down. And when you woke up again, you were floating in the water, surrounded by debris from the plane. You realized that you were lucky to be alive, but the memory of the strange time jump and the explosion haunted you for the rest of your life.
