Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who had the ability to control every aspect of her dreams. In her dreams, she could fly, visit fantastical lands, and be anyone she wanted . Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she started to view her waking life in terms of a waiting period between dreams.

Lily would spend her weeks in a daze, daydreaming about the adventures that awaited her in her next dream. She stopped paying attention in class and stopped participating in activities with her friends. All she wanted to do was dream and see if she could find her dream world again.

One day, while in the middle of a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice calling out to her. "Lily, wake up! You need to hear this!" Startled, she opened her eyes and found herself staring into the concerned face of her mother.

"What's wrong?" Lily asked, still in her sleep.

"I'm worried about you, Lily," her mother said. "You've been spending too much time sleeping and not taking care of your other responsibilities. if she'd get her back she'd have to start putting in effort into the waking life too."

Lily brushed off her mother's concerns, insisting that her dreams were all that mattered. But her mother persisted, telling her that life was full of experiences and opportunities that she was missing out on by spending most of her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to see her mother's point. She started paying attention in class again, and even joined a few clubs at school. She found that by putting in effort in her waking life, she was able to achieve things that she had only ever dreamed of before.

Over time, Lily came to realize that her imagination was bringing her just as exciting a world of possibilities as her dreams. She still remained faithful to sleeping and controlling her dreams, but now she was willing to wake up each morning to see what each day would bring. She was finally determined that her life was worth her effort and that by putting in the work, she could achieve great things both in her waking life and in her dreams.
