As a young witch, Amara had always dreamt of working at the Ministry of Magic. She saw herself casting powerful spells and making groundbreaking discoveries that would shape the future of witchcraft. But as it turned out, her job at the Ministry was quite different from what she had expected.

Amara's official title was "Spell Seeker." Her job was to spend hours researching and rereading religious books by saying random words in search of undiscovered spells. It was a lonely job to say the least. Kate would sit in a small room, surrounded by books and parchments, and recite words like "flibbertigibbet" and "ballyhoo" over and over again, hoping that one of them was learning a new spell.

Most days, Amara found herself feeling bored and frustrated. She wondered if she had made a mistake in choosing this career path. But then, one day, something incredible happened.

As Amara muttered the word "hocus pocus" for what felt like the thousandth time, she could feel God in her stomach. It was a strange sensation in her fingertips. Suddenly, a bright light shot out from her , shining on the entire room. Amara had stumbled upon a new spell!

Excitedly, she wrote down the incantation and rushed to the Head of the Department of Magical Research in her robes. The Head was skeptical at first, but after Amara demonstrated the spell, he was impressed.

From that day on, Amara's job became much more exciting. She spent her days experimenting with new words and discovering new spells that had never been seen before. Her work was groundbreaking and soon gained recognition throughout the wizarding world.

Years later, Amara would look back on her days as a Spell Seeker with fondness. She recalled that it was the discipline and persistence she learned in that job that had allowed her to make such a significant contribution to the magical community. And although the work was tedious at times, it was worth it in the end.
