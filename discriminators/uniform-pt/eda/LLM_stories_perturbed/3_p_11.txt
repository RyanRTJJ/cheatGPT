For as long as he could remember, Tyler had always had the same recurring dream. In it, he would find himself wandering through a fantastical world filled with strange creatures, mysterious creatures, and towering castles. And every time, he would suddenly be joined by a strange girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She never introduced herself, but over time, they became close friends, exploring the dream world together and sharing secrets and stories.

As Tyler grew older, the night memories began to fade, and he struggled to meet the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got found a job, and started building a life for himself. But he never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and sometimes he would catch himself daydreaming about her.

One day, while walking through the park, Tyler saw her. The girl from his dreams. She was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he might just be imagining things, but as he got closer, he realized that it was really her. She looked older, of course, but the sparkling eyes and mischievous smile were still there.

Tyler walked up to her and said hello, but she just looked at him with a blank expression, as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding her of all their adventures in the dream . Again, she just shook her head and said she had to go.

For weeks, Tyler tried to find her again, but she seemed to be avoiding him. Finally, one day, he seemed to catch her alone. He asked her why she was acting normal. He wondered why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him with sad eyes and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I can't explain it right now. It's just too complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more information, but she refused to say anything else. As she walked away, he couldn't help feeling a sense of loss. The girl from his dreams had been real all along, but now she seemed to be slipping away from him once again.

For months, Tyler tried to forget about her, but he never got over the feeling that there was something important he was missing. Then, one night, he had a dream. In it, he was back in the fantastical world, and there she was, the girl from his dream, waiting for him.

As they explored the dream world once again, she became everything to him. She was a traveler between worlds, a guide who helped his navigate the complexities of the multiverse. Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she had been tasked with guiding through his dreams. But now that he was an adult, it was time for her to move on to other responsibilities.

Tyler woke up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had finally found some answers he had been seeking, but he knew he would never see her again. But as he went about his day, he couldn't help but feel a small sense of closure for all of the time they had shared together, both in his dreams and in the brief moments of reality.
