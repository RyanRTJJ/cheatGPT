As I walked into the dark and dingy alleys of the city, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and my heart raced with every step. It was then that I saw it - a familiar figure. With time, hovering in front of me like a portal to a other world. Without pause or a second thought, I slid through the rip and found myself on a cold, metal table. My head spun as I tried to make sense of my surroundings. The room was dimly lit and sterile, with surgical instruments neatly arranged on a table next to me.

As I tried to move, I realized that my arms and legs were tight. Panic set in as I struggled against the restraints, but they held fast. That's when I heard the footsteps approaching.

A figure dressed in white entered the room, their face covered by a moment. They picked up one of the instruments and approached me, their movements precise and deliberate. My heart pounded in my chest as they began to make slits into my flesh with skillful precision.

I screamed out in agony as they worked, but the figure stayed quiet and focused. Minutes passed, and I felt myself growing weaker by the second. Just as I thought it was time to yell to someone, the figure stopped and stepped away, leaving me bleeding and alone on the table.

I lay there, gasping for breath, unsure of what had happened. It was only when I managed to wrench myself free from the restraints that had trapped me in the hospital bed. I had been transported to a future where medical science had advanced to unimaginable heights.

But at what cost? As I stumbled out of the room and into the bright, open world of the future, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had been violated in ways that went beyond physical pain. The rip in time that had brought me there had torn up a rift in my soul, for I knew that I could never truly return to the life I had known before.
