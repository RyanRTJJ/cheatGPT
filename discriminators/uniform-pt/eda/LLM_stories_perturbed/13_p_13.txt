. As a young witch, Amara had always dreamed of working at the Ministry of Magic. She had imagined herself casting powerful spells and making groundbreaking discoveries that would shape the wizarding world. But as it turned out, her experience inside the Ministry was quite different from what she had expected.

Amara's official title was "Spell Seeker." Her job was to spend several hours each day saying random words in search of undiscovered spells. It was a tiring process to say the least. Amara would sit in a small room, surrounded by books , and recite words like "flibbertigibbet" and "ballyhoo" over and over again, hoping that one of them would trigger a new feeling in her. By the end of each semester, Amara found herself feeling bored and frustrated. She wondered if she had made a mistake by choosing this career path. But then, one day, something incredible happened.

As Amara was reciting the word "hocus pocus" for what felt like the thousandth time, she felt a strange sensation in her heart and a bright light shot out from her wand, illuminating the entire room. Amara had stumbled upon a new treasure! She wrote down the incantation and rushed to the Head of the Department of Magical Research to share her discovery. The Head was skeptical at first, but after Amara demonstrated new words and he was impressed.

From that point on, Amara's life became much more exciting. She spent her days experimenting with new words and discovering new spells that had never been seen before. Her work was groundbreaking and soon gained recognition throughout the wizarding world.

Years later, Amara would look back on her days as a Spell Seeker with fondness. She realized that it was the patience and persistence she learned in that job that had allowed her to make such a significant contribution to the magical community. And although the work was not easy at times, it was all worth it in the end.
