The alien leader was furious. He had sent his best troops to invade Earth and had given them the most advanced weapons to destroy the puny humans. But now, he was receiving reports that their assault s had fallen short. "What do you mean they ate our babies?" Corey bellowed at the Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the humans have developed a weapon against our weaponry, sir. They've been consuming it instead of being destroyed by it."

Zaxar's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's impossible. How can they eat our weapons?"

Gorg cleared his throat nervously. So far it had never occurred to him that the humans had been experimenting with modified crops to digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been feeding them to their livestock, but now the humans themselves have developed a taste for them."

Zaxar rubbed his scaly chin, deep in thought. He had not anticipated this development. His species had been conquering other planets for centuries, and never had they encountered race that could consume their weapons.

"Very well," Zaxar finally said. "We will need to refine our strategy. Gorg, send a message to our future savior, develop a new kind of weapon that the humans cannot eat. We will not be defeated by a race of plants that eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's orders, the alien overlord couldn't help but feel a sense of grudging respect for his fellow humans. They were resourceful, and their determination and courage was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle against the humans was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
