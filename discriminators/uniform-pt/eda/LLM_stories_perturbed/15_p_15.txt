The alien overlord, Zaxar, was furious. He had sent his best troops to invade Earth and had given them his most advanced weapons to destroy the puny invading troops. But now, he was receiving reports that their assault was failing.

"What do you mean they ate our ammunition?" Zaxar asked his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems the humans have developed an appetite for our weaponry, sir. They've been consuming it instead of being destroyed by it."

Zaxar's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's impossible. How can they eat our weapons?"

Gorg cleared her throat, shaking her head nervously. "It appears that the humans have been experimenting with genetically modified crops that can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been feeding these crops to their livestock, and now they themselves have developed a taste for them."

Zaxar 's scaly mouth narrowed in thought. He had not anticipated this development. His fleet had been conquering other planets for centuries, and never had they encountered a species that could consume their own flesh?" Zaxar finally said. "We will need to adapt our strategy. Gorg, send a message to our scientists to develop a type of weapon that the humans cannot eat and we will not be defeated by any kind of beings who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's orders, the alien overlord couldn't help but feel a sense of grudging respect for the humans. They were resourceful, and their determination to survive was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for humanity was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
