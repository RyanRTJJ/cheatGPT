You woke up with a start, your heart pounding and your mind racing as you sat up in your seat on the plane. The last thing you envisioned was getting out of bed, popping open your watch and seeing the time was 10:34 am, just before a deafening explosion had rocked the plane, sending debris flying everywhere. You had braced yourself for impact, but now you were still alive and very energized. Without thinking, you looked around and saw your fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be sleeping peacefully or engrossed in their in-flight entertainment. You glanced out the window and saw nothing but blue sky and fluffy white clouds. It was as if you had never happened.

You looked at your watch and checked the time. To your surprise, it read two months. Had you been dreaming? It all felt so real.

As you had been trying to make sense of what had just happened, the captain's voice came over the intercom. "Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the delay in processing your order. Please remain seated with your seat belts fastened until we have safely passed through this patch of land." You looked around and realised that although no one else seemed to have noticed anything , the hum of the plane's engine did seem to have changed slightly, as if it was struggling to maintain its altitude.

You felt a chill run down your spine as you realized that something was not right. You glanced out the window again and saw that the sky had turned blue, as if it was nighttime. But it was only 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was another loud noise, this time from your rental car engine. It sounded like a loud bang, followed by a loud hissing sound. People around you started to panic and scream as the plane began to lose altitude rapidly.

You scrambled to fasten your seat belts and braced yourself for the worst. For the first time, you knew it was real.

As the plane crashed into the ocean, you felt a sharp pain in your head and , and went black. When you woke up again, you were floating in the water, surrounded by debris from the plane. You realized that you were lucky to be alive, but the memories of the strange time jump and the explosion haunted you for the rest of your life.
