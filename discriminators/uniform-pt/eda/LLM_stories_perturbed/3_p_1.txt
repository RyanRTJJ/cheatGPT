For as long as he could remember, he always had the same recurring dream. In it, he would find himself wandering through a fantastical world filled with strange creatures and towering castles. And every time, he would be joined by a young girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She never introduced herself, but over time, they became close friends, exploring the dream world together and sharing secrets and stories.

As Tyler grew older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of everyday life. He went to school, got a job, and started building a life for himself. But he never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and sometimes he would catch himself daydreaming about her.

One day, while he was walking along the street, Tyler suddenly saw her. The girl from his dreams. She was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he must be imagining things, but as he got closer, he could see that it was really her. She was getting older, of course, but the sparkling eyes and mischievous smile were still there.

Tyler walked up to her and said hello, but she just looked at him with a blank expression, as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding Tyler about their adventures in the dream world, but she just shook her head and said she had to go.

For weeks, Tyler tried to find her again, but she seemed to be avoiding him. Finally, one day, he managed to catch her and asked her why she was acting so strange, why did she seem to remember him. She looked at him with sad eyes and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I can't explain it right now. I remember something very complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more information, but she refused to say anything else. As she walked away, he couldn't help feeling a sense of loss. The girl of his dreams had been real all along, but now she seemed to be slipping away from him once again.

For months, Tyler tried to forget Missy, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something important he was missing. Then, one night, he had a dream. In it, he was back in the fantastical world, and there she was, the girl of his dreams, waiting for him.

As they explored the dream world once again, she finally explained everything to him. She was a walker through the worlds, a guide who knew how to navigate the was an important ally of the Goddess and the first woman to come into the multiverse. Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she had been tasked with guiding through his dreams. But now that he was an adult, it was time for her to turn her attention to other responsibilities.

Tyler woke up feeling confused and saddened. He had finally gotten the answers he had been seeking, but he knew he would never see her again. As he went about his day, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the time they spent together, both in his dreams and in the brief moments of reality.
