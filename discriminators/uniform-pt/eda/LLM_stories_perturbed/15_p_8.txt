The alien overlord, Zaxar, was furious. He had sent his troops to invade Earth and had provided the most advanced weapons to destroy the puny humans. But now, he was receiving reports that their assault had brought peace to Earth. "What do you mean they ate the people?" Zaxar bellowed at his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the humans have developed a taste for our blood. They've been consuming it instead of being destroyed by our own Virus?" Zaxar's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's impossible. How can they eat it?" Kan cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that the humans are experimenting with genetically modified crops that can digest metal, including metal. They've been feeding these crops to their livestock, and now the livestock have developed a taste for these crops as well! Noone could be surprised. He rubbed his scaly chin, deep in thought. He had not anticipated this development. His species has been conquering other planets for centuries, and never had they encountered a species that could consume metal, especially at the edges of space ships as well," Gorg said. "We will need to reconsider our strategy. Gorg, send a message to our scientists to develop a new kind of weapon that the humans cannot eat. We will not be defeated by a group of beings who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's orders, the aliens couldn't help but feel a sense of grudging admiration for the humans. They were resourceful, and their determination to survive was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for his life was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
