For as long as he could remember, Tyler had always had the same recurring dream. In it, he would find himself wandering through a strange world filled with strange creatures and secrets. And every time, he would be joined by a strange girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She never introduced herself, but over time, they became quite comfortable exploring the dream world together and sharing secrets and stories.

As Tyler grew older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got a job, and started building a life for himself. But he never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and sometimes he would catch himself daydreaming about her.

One day then, while walking through the park, Tyler saw her. The one from his dreams. She was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he must be imagining things, but as he , he could see that it was . She looked older, of course, but the sparkling eyes and mischievous smile were still there.

Tyler walked up to her and said hello, but she just looked at him with a blank expression, as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her back and remind her of their adventures in the dream world, but she just shook her head and said she had to stay out of it. Tyler tried to irritate her again, but she seemed to be avoiding him. Finally, one day, he managed to catch her alone. He asked her why she was acting so strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him in the eyes and said, "I remember you, but sometimes I can't explain it right . It's just too complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more information, but she refused to say anything else. As she walked away, he couldn't help feeling a sense of loss. The girl from his dreams had been real all along, but now she seemed to be slipping away from him once again.

For months, Tyler tried to forget about her, but he could never shake the feeling that there was something important he was missing. Then, one night, he had a dream about her. By the end of it, he was back in her fantastical world, and there she was, the guide to his dreams, waiting for him.

As they explored the dream world once again, she finally explained everything to him. She was a traveler between worlds, a guide who helped people navigate the complexities of the multiverse. He had once been one of her charges, someone she had helped with guiding through his dreams. But now that he was an adult, it was time for her to move on to his new adventures. He woke up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had finally gotten the answers he had been seeking, but he knew he would never see her again. As he went about his day, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the time they had shared together, both in his dreams and in the brief season they spent together in reality.
