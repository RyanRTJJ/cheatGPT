Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lily who had the unique ability to control every aspect of her dreams. In her dreams she could fly, visit fantastical lands, and be almost anything she wanted to be. Her life in dreams was so much more, so vivid and exciting that she started to view her waking life as merely a waiting period , she would spend her days in a daze, daydreaming about the adventures that awaited her in her next dream. She stopped paying attention in class or participating in activities with her friends. All she wanted was to sleep so she could jump-start in her dream world again.

One day, she was in the middle of a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice calling to her. "Lily, wake up! You need to hear this!" Startled, she opened her eyes to find herself staring at the concerned face of her mother.

"What's wrong?" Lily asked, still groggy from sleep.

"I'm worried about you, Lily," her mother said. "You've been spending all your time sleeping and neglecting your responsibilities. You need to start putting in effort into your waking life too."

Lily brushed aside her mother's concerns, insisting that her days were all that mattered. But her mother persisted, telling her that life was full of experiences and that she was missing out on by spending all her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to see her Lily found herself re-focusing and trying hard to be productive. She started paying attention in class again, and even joined a few clubs at school. She found that by putting in effort in her waking life, she was able to achieve things that she had only ever wanted to before.

Over time, Lily began to realize that life was not as exciting and full of possibilities as her dreams. She still looked forward to sleeping and controlling her dreams, but now she was eager to see what each day would bring. She learned that life was worth the effort and that by putting in the work, she could achieve amazing results both in her waking life and in her dreams.
