For as long as he can remember, Tyler McCloud had the same recurring dream. In it, he would find himself wandering through a fantastical world filled with strange creatures and haunted castles. And every time, he would be joined by a strange girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She and herself, and over time, they became close friends, exploring the dream world together and sharing secrets and stories.

As Tyler grew older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of life. He went to college, got a job, and started building a life for himself. But he never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and Tyler sometimes would catch himself daydreaming about her.

One day, while walking through the park, Tyler saw her. The girl from his dreams. She was sitting on a rock, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he must be imagining things, but as he got closer, he could see that it was really her. She looked older, of course, but her sparkling eyes and mischievous smile were still there.

Tyler walked up to her and said hello, but she just looked at him with a blank expression, as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding her of their adventures in the dream world, but she just shook her head and said she had to go.

For weeks, people were trying to find her again, but she seemed to be hiding. Finally, one of them managed to catch her alone. He asked her why she was acting so stupid, but she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him with sad eyes and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I don't want to deal with it right now. It's too complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more information, but she refused to say anything else. As she walked away, he couldn't help feeling a sense of loss. The girl from his dreams had been real all along, but now she seemed to be slipping away from him . For months, Tyler tried to forget about her, but he still had the feeling that there was something important he was missing. Then, one night, he had a dream. As soon as he was back in the fantastical world, he discovered she was, the girl from his dreams, waiting for him.

As they explored the dream world once again, she finally explained everything to him. She was a dream traveller between different worlds, a guide who helped people navigate the complexities of the multiverse. Tyler was one of her charges, someone she had been tasked with guiding through his dreams. But now that he was an adult, it was time for her to move on to other responsibilities.

Tyler woke up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had finally gotten the answers he had been seeking, but he knew he would never see her again. As he went about his day, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the time they had shared together, both in his dreams and in the brief moments of reality.
