As the head of NASA, I've long known that the Earth is flat. It's a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few in the government and scientific community.

So when the incoming President asked me how NASA kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this a secret is because it would be cause for mass panic and chaos if the public were to learn this," I explained.

"But why would that be?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would completely undermine our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics," I explained. "It would also raise a lot of questions about our place in the world and our place as a species."

The professor listened carefully and thoughtfully. "I see your point," he said. "But don't you think the public has a right to the truth?"

I sighed. "Yes, of course they do. But we need to be careful about how we reveal this information. We need to make sure that people understand the true nature of what it means for our world."

The President nodded as he left, but I could tell he was deep feeling. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with me," he said.

As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of elation and sadness for the future. It wasn't easy keeping such a secret for so long, but I was glad that we were doing the right thing by keeping the truth hidden for now. Perhaps one day, when humanity is ready, we can reveal the truth and begin to explore the mysteries of the future planet Earth.
