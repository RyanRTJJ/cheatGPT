As the head of NASA, I've always known that the Earth is flat. It's a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few within the government and scientific community.

So when the President asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this a secret is because it would cause mass panic and chaos if the public were given the truth," I explained.

"But why would that be?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would completely undermine our understanding of gravity and the laws of quantum physics," I said. "Secondly, it would also raise a lot of questions about our place in the world and our purpose as a species." He nodded thoughtfully. "I see your point," I said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know the truth?"

I sighed. "Of course they do. But we need to be careful about how we reveal this information. We need to make sure that people are comfortable knowing the implications of what it means for our world."

The President nodded again, and I could tell that he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with me," he said.

As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for so long, but we knew that we were doing the right thing by keeping the truth hidden for now. Perhaps one day, when humanity is ready, we can reveal the truth and begin to explore the mysteries of outer space and life beyond our flat Earth.
