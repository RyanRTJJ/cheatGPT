John had always been fascinated with the idea of immortality. He had spent years researching and experimenting in his basement laboratory, and finally, he had made it. He had discovered the miracle of immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the incredible things he could accomplish now that he had all the time in the world. But suddenly, Death appeared before him, handing him a business card with a cryptic message. "When you realize living forever , please call me at this number. I've got a job offer for you."

John was confused but intrigued. He couldn't imagine something that would lead to a job, but he decided to keep the card and talk with his newfound immortality.

At first, John was thrilled with his newfound longevity. He traveled the world, learned new skills, and amassed a fortune. But as time went on, he began to discover that living forever wasn't as easy as he had thought it would be. He watched in desperation as his loved ones aged and passed away, leaving him alone in a world that was constantly changing. He saw wars and accidents that he could do nothing to prevent. He felt he was like a prisoner in his body, unable to escape the monotony of endless days.

It was then that John remembered the business card Death sent him. He decided to call the number, curious to see what kind of job offer Death could have for an immortal man like himself.

To his surprise, Death answered the phone, his voice calm and firm. "I knew you would call eventually," he said. "I have a job offer for you, John. I need someone to help me manage the afterlife, someone who knows what it's like to live to believe what he was doing, but as Death explained the details of the job, John realized that this was exactly what he had been looking for. With Death by his side, John could finally use his immortality to help others, to guide them through the afterlife and ensure that they found peace.

And so, John accepted the job offer and started a whole new chapter of his life. He no longer felt trapped in his immortality but instead embraced it as a tool to help others find purpose. And though he still missed his mortal friends and family, he knew that he was where he was meant to be.
