John had always been fascinated with the idea of immortality. He had spent years researching and testing in his basement laboratory, and finally, he had done it. He had uncovered the secret to immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the incredible things he could accomplish now that he had all the time in the world. Then suddenly, Death appeared before him, handing him a business card with a cryptic message. "Mr. Death, I gotta realize living forever sucks, call this number. I've got a job for you."

John was confused but intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death would actually offer him a job, but he decided to keep the card and continue with his newfound immortality.

At first, John was thrilled with his newfound longevity. He traveled the world, gained new skills, and amassed a fortune. But as time went on, John realized that living forever was not as wonderful as he had thought it would be. He watched as his loved ones aged and passed away, leaving him alone in a world that was constantly at his disposal. He saw wars and disasters that he could do nothing to prevent. He felt like a prisoner in his own body, unable to escape the seemingly endless trance. It was then that John remembered the business card Death had given him. He decided to call the number, curious to see what kind of job offer he could have for an immortal man like himself.

To his surprise, a man answered the phone, his voice calm and reassuring. "I knew you would call eventually," he said. "I have a job offer for you, John. I need someone to help manage the team now." John was someone who understands what it's like to live forever."

John couldn't believe what he was hearing. But as Death explained the details of the job, John realized that this was exactly what he had been looking for - they could finally trust immortality to their descendants. Death was willing to guide them into the afterlife and ensure that they found peace.

And so, John accepted the job offer and began a new chapter of his endless life. He no longer felt trapped in his immortality but instead embraced it as a tool to help others find their way. While he still missed his mortal friends and family, he knew that he was where he was meant to be.
