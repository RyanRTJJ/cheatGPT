For as long as he could remember, Tyler had always had the same recurring dream. In it, he would find himself wandering through a world filled with strange creatures and towering castles. Near the end of the time, he would be joined by a strange girl with sparkling black eyes and a mischievous smile. She at first a friend, and she always wanted her herself, but over time, they became close friends, exploring the dream world together and sharing secrets and stories.

As he got older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got a job, and started building a life for himself. But he never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and sometimes he would catch himself daydreaming about her.

One day, while walking through the park, Tyler caught himself staring at her. The girl from his dreams. She was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he must be imagining things, but as he got closer and could see that it was really her. A whole lot older, of course, but the sparkling eyes and mischievous smile were still there.

Tyler reached over to her and said hello, but she just looked at him with a blank expression, as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding her of their adventures in the dream world, but she just got a numb head and said she had to go.

For weeks, Tyler tried to find her again, but she seemed to be avoiding him. Finally, he decided he could catch her alone. He asked her why she was acting so strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him with sad eyes and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I can't explain it right now. It's too complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more information, but she resisted his need to say anything else. As soon as he was turned away, he Tyler started feeling a sense of loneliness. The girl from the fantasy had been real all along, but now she seemed to be slipping away from him once again.

For months, Tyler tried to forget about her, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something important he was missing. Then, one night, he had a dream. In it, he was back in the fantastical world, and there was Sheila, the girl from his dreams, waiting for him.

As they explored the dream world once again, she explained everything to him. She was a traveler between worlds, a guide who helped people navigate the complexities of the multiverse. Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she had been tasked with guiding through his dreams. But now that he was an adult, it was time for her to move on to other responsibilities.

Tyler woke up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had finally gotten the answers he had been seeking, he knew he would never see him again. As he went about his day, he couldn't help but feel grateful for his two friends -- they shared their lives and the moments they had shared together, both in his dreams and in the brief moments of reality.
