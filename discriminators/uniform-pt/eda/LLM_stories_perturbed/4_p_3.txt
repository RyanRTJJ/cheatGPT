You woke up with the sound of your heart racing as you sat up in your seat on the plane. The last thing you remembered was glancing at your watch to see the time was about 20:00, just before a deafening explosion had rocked the plane, sending debris flying over the deck. One you had braced yourself for just now . It sounded like you were still alive and unharmed.

Confused, you looked around at your fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be occupied or engrossed in their in-flight entertainment. You glanced out the window and saw nothing but blue sky and fluffy white clouds. It was as if the explosion had never happened.

You grabbed your watch and checked the time. To your surprise, it read 9:35 am. Had you missed anything? It all felt so real.

As you tried to make sense of what had just happened, the captain's voice came over the intercom. "Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for the slight turbulence. Please remain seated with your seat belts fastened until we 've passed through this patch of rough air."

Turbulence? You looked over and saw that no one else on the flight would have noticed anything unusual. But the sound of the plane's engine did seem to have changed slightly, as if it was struggling to maintain altitude.

You felt a chill down your spine as you realized that something was not right. You glanced out the window and saw that the sky had turned dark, as if it was nighttime. But it was only 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was a familiar noise, this time from the engine. It sounded like a loud bang, followed by a loud explosion. People around you started to panic and flinch as the plane began to lose control. You scrambled to fasten your seat belt and braced yourself for impact. This time, you knew it was real.

As the plane crashed into the ocean, you felt a sharp pain in your head and everything went off. When you woke up again, you were floating on water, surrounded by debris from the plane. You realized that you were lucky to be alive, but the memory of the strange time jump and the explosion haunted you for the rest of your life.
