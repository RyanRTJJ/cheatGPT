For as long as he could remember, Tyler had always had the same recurring dream. In it, he would find himself wandering through a dream land filled with strange creatures and mysterious objects. And every time, he would be joined by a strange girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She never introduced herself, they called each other Tina. Over time, they became close friends, exploring the dream world, and sharing secrets and stories.

As Tyler grew older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got a job, and started building a life for himself. But he never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and sometimes he would stop himself from daydreaming about her.

One day, while walking through the park, Tyler saw her. The girl from his dreams. She was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he must be imagining things, but as he got closer, he could see that it was really her. She looked older, of course, but the adorable eyes and mischievous smile were still there.

Tyler walked up to her and said hello, but she just looked at him with a blank expression, as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding her of their adventures in our outside world, but she shook her head and said she had to go.

For weeks, Tyler tried to find her again, but she seemed to be avoiding him. Finally, one day, he managed to catch her alone. He asked her why she found so strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him with sad eyes and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I can't explain it right now. It's too complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more information but she refused to say anything else. As she walked away, he couldn't help feeling a sense of loss. The girl from his dreams had been real all along, but now she seemed to be away from him once again.

For months, Tyler tried to forget about her, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something important he was missing. The girl from his dreams was his one night, he had a dream. In it, he was back in the fantastical world, and there she was, the girl from his dreams, waiting for him.

As they explored the magical world once again, she finally explained everything to him. She was a traveler between the realities, and a guide who helped people navigate the complexities of the world. Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she had been tasked with guiding through his dreams. But now that he was an adult, it was time for her to move on to her other responsibilities.

Tyler woke up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had been given all the answers he had been seeking, but he knew he would see her again. As he went about his day, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the many hours they had shared together, both in his dreams and in the brief moments of reality.
