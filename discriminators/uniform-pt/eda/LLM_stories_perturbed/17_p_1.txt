Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who had the ability to control every aspect of her dreams. In her dreams, she could fly, visit fantastical lands, and be anyone she wanted to be. Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she started to think of her waking life as merely a waiting period . She would spend her days in a daze, daydreaming about the adventures that awaited her in her next dream. She stopped paying attention in class and stopped participating in activities with her friends. All she wanted was to be out of school, so she could visit her dream world again.

One day, while in the daze, she realized a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice calling out to her. "Lily, wake up! You need help with this!" Startled, she opened her eyes and found herself staring into the concerned face of her mother.

"What's wrong?" Lily asked, still unable to sleep.

"I'm worried about you, Lily," her mother said. "You've been spending all your time dreaming and neglecting your responsibilities. You need to start investing some time and effort into your dream career too."

Lily brushed off her mother's point, thinking that her dreams were all that mattered. But her mother persisted, giving Lily the reminder that life was full of experiences and opportunities that she was missing out on by spending all her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to see her mother's point. She started paying attention to her studies again, and even joined a few clubs at school. She found that by putting enough effort in her waking life, she was able to achieve things that she had only ever dreamed of. At this time, Lily began to realize that life was just as exciting and full of possibilities as her dreams. She still looked forward to sleeping and controlling her thoughts and moods, but now she was excited to see what each day would bring. She learned that life is full of opportunities for her and that by putting in the work, she could achieve amazing things both in her waking life and in her dreams.
