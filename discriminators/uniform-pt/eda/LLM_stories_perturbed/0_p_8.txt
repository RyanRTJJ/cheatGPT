John had always been fascinated with the idea of immortality. He had spent years researching and testing it in his basement laboratory, and finally, he had done it. He had discovered the secret to immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the incredible science he could accomplish now that he had all the time in the world. But suddenly, Death appeared before him, handing him a phone book complete with a cryptic message. "Now that you realize living forever sucks, call this number. I've got a job offer for you."

John was pretty intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death would offer him a job, but he decided to hand over the card and continue with his newfound immortality.

At first, John was thrilled with his newfound longevity. He traveled the world, learned new skills, and amassed a fortune. But as time went on, John began to realize that living was not as wonderful as he had thought it would be.

He watched as his loved ones aged and passed away, leaving him alone with no one in the world that was all he could remember. He saw wars and disasters that he could do nothing to prevent. He felt like a prisoner in his own body, unable to break the monotony of endless days.

It was this moment that John remembered the business card Death had given him. He decided to call the number, curious to see what the best job offer Death could have for an immortal man like himself.

To his relief, Death answered the phone, his voice calm and reassuring. "I knew you would call eventually," he said. "I have a job offer for you, John. I need someone to help me through the afterlife, someone who understands what it's like to live forever."

John couldn't believe what he was hearing. But as he walked right on through the process of accepting the job, John realized that this was exactly what he had been waiting for. He could finally use his immortality to help others, to guide them through their problems and ensure that they found peace.

And so, John accepted the job offer and began a new chapter of his endless life. He no longer felt trapped in his immortality but instead embraced it as a tool to help everyone find their way. And though he still missed his mortal friends , he knew that he was where he was meant to be.
