For as long as he could remember, Matt has always had the same recurring dream. In it, he would find himself wandering through a fantastical world filled with strange creatures and towering castles. And every time, he would be joined by a strange girl with brown eyes and a mischievous smile. She never introduced herself, but over time, they became close friends, exploring the dream world together and sharing secrets and stories.

As Tyler grew older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got a job, and started building a life for himself. However, Tyler never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and sometimes he would catch himself daydreaming about her.

One day, walking through the park, Tyler saw her. The girl from his dreams. She was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he could just be imagining things, but as he got closer, he could see that it was really a little girl from the past. She looked older, of course, but the sparkling eyes and mischievous smile were still there.

Tyler walked up to her and said hello, but she looked at him with a blank expression, like she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding her of being back in the dream world, but she just shook her head and said she had to go.

For weeks, Tyler tried to catch up with her again, but she seemed to be avoiding him. Finally, one day, he managed to reconnect and found her alone. He asked her why why she was acting so strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him with a cockeyed face and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I can't explain it right now. It's too complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more, but she refused to say anything else. As she walked away, he , he was feeling a sense of loss. The girl from his dreams had been real all along, but now she seemed to be slipping away from him once again. Tyler tried to forget about her, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something important he was missing. Then, one night, he had a dream. In it, he was back in the fantastical world, where she was, the girl of his dreams, waiting for him.

As he was transported to the dream world once again, she finally explained everything to him. She was a traveler between worlds, a guide who helped people navigate the complexities of her work. At that time, Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she had been tasked with guiding through his dreams. But now that he was an adult, it was time for her to move on from her responsibilities.

Tyler woke up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had finally gotten the answers he was seeking, but he knew he would never meet this woman again. As he went about his day, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the time they had shared together, both in their fantasy lives and in the brief moments of reality.
