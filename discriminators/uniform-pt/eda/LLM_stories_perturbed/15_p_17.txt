The alien overlord, Zaxar, was furious. He had sent his best troops to the Earth and had given them the most advanced weapons to destroy the puny humans. But now, he was receiving reports that their assault was failing.

"What do you mean that they ate our ammunition?" Zaxar bellowed at his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under his anxious gaze. "It seems that the humans there have shown a taste for our weaponry, sir. They've been consuming it instead of being destroyed by it."

Zaxar's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's impossible. How can they eat our weapons?"

Gorg cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that the weaponry has been modified," Zaxar murmured, "and genetically modified crops that can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been feeding these crops to their humans and now the humans themselves have developed a taste for them."

Zaxar rubbed his chin, deep in thought. He had not anticipated this development. His fleet had been out exploring planets across space since the late sixties, and never had they encountered a species that could consume their flesh, Zaxar finally said. "We will need to adapt our equipment and send a mission to our scientists to develop a new type of weapon that the humans cannot eat. We will not be defeated by a race of beings who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's orders, the alien overlord couldn't help but feel a bit of grudging respect for the humans. They were resourceful, and their determination to survive was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to protect it, no matter what it took.
