It was a beautiful summer day, and I decided to take my kids to the park. They were ecstatic and couldn't wait to start playing on all of the cool rides and slides. As we arrived, I noticed some dark clouds looming in the sky, but I thought we had plenty of time to enjoy the park before the rain hit.

As my kids played, I started to notice the telltale signs of a lightning strike. The hair on my arms began to stand up, and the air felt so charged. I immediately knew we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my kids and ran towards the closest exit. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning struck nearby, and I felt an excruciating pain coursing through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my legs tangled up â€” crying and calling out my name.

It took me a few moments to realize what had happened. I had been hit by lightning, I got up, I noticed that something had changed. My senses were heightened, and I could pinpoint things around me with incredible accuracy. It was like a sixth sense had been activated within me.

As I walked with my kids back to our car, I realized that my awareness had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate every move my kids were about to make, and I could sense danger before it really struck. It was like I had become a superhero, with the power to protect my kids . From that day on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had always been a protective father, but now I could help to the next trip. Now I could sense danger before it happened, and I could react before anyone else even knew anything was going on. When we got into the car, my kids looked up at me with concern. But I smiled at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's got this. With Mom Senses and Dad Senses, we'll always be safe."
