Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who had the unique ability to control every aspect of the world from her dreams. In her dreams, she could explore new worlds, explore fantastical lands, and be anyone she wanted to be. Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she started to treat her waking life as merely a waiting period between her dreams she would spend her days in a daze, daydreaming about the adventures that awaited her in her next dream. She stopped paying attention in class and stopped participating in activities with her friends. All she wanted was to sleep so she could enter her dream world again.

One day, while in the middle of a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice calling out to her. "Lily, wake up! You need to hear this!" Startled, she opened her eyes and found herself staring into the concerned face of her mother.

"What's wrong?" she asked, still groggy from her nightmare. "I worry about you, Lily," her mother said. "You've been spending all night sleeping and barely doing anything to fulfill your responsibilities. You may need to start putting in effort into your waking life". Lily brushed off her mother's concerns, insisting that her dreams were all that mattered. But her mother persisted, telling her that her life was full of new opportunities that she was missing out on by spending all her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to see her mother's point. She began paying attention and working hard again, and even joined a few clubs at school. She found that by putting in effort in her waking life, she was able to achieve things that she had only ever dreamed of before.

Over time, she began to realize that life was just as exciting and full of possibilities as . She still looked forward to sleeping and controlling her dreams, but now she was also eager to awaken and see what each day would bring. She learned that life was worth her effort and that by putting in the hard work she could achieve amazing things both in her waking life and in her dreams.
