It was a beautiful summer day, and I decided to take my kids to the park. They were so excited and couldn't wait to start playing on the swings and slides. As we arrived, we saw some dark clouds looming in the distance, but I thought we had plenty of time to enjoy the park before the rain hit.

As my kids were playing, I began to notice the telltale signs of a lightning strike. The hair on my fingers began to stand up, and the air felt electrically charged. I immediately knew we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my kids and we started our journey towards the nearest shelter. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning struck my windshield. I felt an excruciating pain coursing through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the floor with my kids crying and calling out my name.

It took me a few moments to realize what had happened. I had been hit by lightning. As I got up, I noticed something strange. My senses were high! I could sense everything around me with incredible accuracy. It was like a sixth sense had been activated within me.

As I walked with my kids back to our car, I realized that my senses had increased 100 fold. I could sense every move my kids were about to make, and I could sense danger before it happened. It was like I was a superhero, with the power to protect my kids from harm.

From that day on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had always been a protective father, but now I could bring it to the next level. I could sense danger before anyone else, and to react before anyone else even knew what was going on.

As we got into the car, my kids looked up at me with concern. I smiled at them and said, "Don't be scared. We've got this. With my Dad Senses, we'll always be safe."
