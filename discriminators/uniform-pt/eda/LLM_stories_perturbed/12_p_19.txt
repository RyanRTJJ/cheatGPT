As the head of NASA, I've always known that the Earth is flat. It's a fact known only to a select few within the nation's scientific community.

So when the incoming President asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this a secret is because it would cause shock and chaos if the public were to learn the truth," I explained to the President. "How much turmoil would that be?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would completely undermine our understanding of reality and chemistry and the laws of physics," I said. "It would also raise a lot of questions about our place in the world and our purpose as a species."

The President nodded . "I can see your point," he said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know the truth?"

I told him of course they do. And we need to be careful about how we reveal this information. We need to make sure that people understand the implications of what it means for our world."

The President nodded again, and you could tell he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with us," he said.

As he left my room, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for so long, but I knew that we were doing the right thing and hiding the truth for now. Perhaps one day, when humanity is a little more mature, we can reveal the truth and begin to explore the mysteries of our flat Earth.
