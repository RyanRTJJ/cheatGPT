For as long as he could remember, Tyler had always had the same recurring dream. In each dream, he would find himself wandering through a fantastical world filled with strange creatures and towering castles. Around this time, he would be interrupted by a strange girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She never introduced herself, but over time, they became friends, exploring the streets together and sharing secrets and stories.

As Tyler grew older, his childhood dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got a job, and started building a life for himself. But he never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and sometimes he would catch himself daydreaming about her.

One day, while walking through the park, Tyler saw her. The girl from his dreams. She was sitting on a bench nearby, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he must be imagining things, but as he , he could see that it was really her. She looked older, of course, but the sparkling eyes and mischievous smile were still there.

Tyler walked up to her and said hello, but she just looked at him with a blank expression, as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding her of their adventures in the dream world, but she just shook her head and said she had to go.

For weeks, Tyler tried reaching her again, but she seemed to ignore him. Finally, one day, he managed to catch her alone. He also asked her why she was acting so strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him with sad eyes and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I can't explain it right now. It's too complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more information, but she refused to say anything else. As she walked away, he couldn't help feeling a sense of loss. The girl from his dreams had been there for real all along, but now she seemed to be slipping away from him once again.

For a time, he tried to forget about her, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something important he was missing. Then, one night, John woke up and had a dream. In it, he was back in her world, and there she was, the girl from his dreams, waiting for him.

As they explored the dream together again, she finally explained everything to him. She was a traveler between worlds, a guide who helped people navigate the complexities of the multiverse. Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she had been tasked with guiding through his youth. But now that he was an aged adult, it was time for her to move on and take on other responsibilities.

Tyler woke up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had finally gotten the answers he had been seeking, but he knew that he would never see her again. As he went about his day, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the time they'd shared together, both in his dreams and in the brief moments of reality.
