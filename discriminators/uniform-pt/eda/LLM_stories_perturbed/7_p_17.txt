It was a beautiful summer day, and I decided to take my kids to the park. They were ecstatic and couldn't wait to start playing on the swings and slides. As we walked, I noticed some dark clouds in the distance, but I thought we would have three hours of sunshine to enjoy the park before the rain started pelting their rooftops. While my kids were playing, I started to notice the screams of a lightning strike. The hair on my arms began to stand up, and the air felt electrically charged. I immediately knew we had to get out of this area. I grabbed my kids and ran towards a shelter. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning struck me, and I felt an excruciating pain coursing through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my head down, and calling out my name.

It took me a few moments to realize what had happened. I had been struck by a bolt of lightning. As I got up, I noticed something. My senses were heightened, and I could sense everything around me with more than my brain. It was like a sixth sense had been activated within me.

As I walked with my kids back to our car, I realized that my Dad Senses had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate every move my kids knew the right choices to make, and you could sense danger before it happened. It was like I had become a superhero. I had the power to protect my kids from harm.

From that day on, I knew I had been given a gift. I had always been a protective father, but now I could take it to the next level. I could sense danger before anyone else, and I could react before anyone else even knew what was going on.

As we got into the car, my family looked up at me with concern. But I smiled at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's got this. With my help, we'll always be safe."
