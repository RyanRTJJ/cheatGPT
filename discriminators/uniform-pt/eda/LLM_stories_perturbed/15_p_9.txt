The alien overlord, Zaxar, was furious. He had sent his best troops to attack and had given them the best equipment and advanced weapons to destroy the puny humans. But now, he was receiving reports that their assault was failing.

"What do they have to give us if they ate our ammunition?" Zaxar bellowed at the Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the humans have developed a new use for our weaponry, sir. They seem quite adept at consuming it instead of being destroyed by it."

Zaxar's eyes widened in disbelief. "Humans? How can they eat our weapons?"

Gorg cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that the humans have been experimenting with genetically modified crops that can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been feeding these crops to various creatures, and now the humans themselves have developed a taste for them."

Zaxar rubbed his eyes deep in thought. He hadn't anticipated this development. His crew had been conquering other planets for centuries, and never had they encountered a species that could consume their weapons.

"Very well," Zaxar finally said. "We will have to change our strategy. Gorg, send a message to our scientists to develop a new kind of weapon that the species cannot eat. We will not be defeated by a race of beings who eat metal."

As Gorg sent a message to the scientists they were relay Zaxar's new alien overlord couldn't help but feel a sense of grudging respect for the humans. They were resourceful, and their determination to endure their fate was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
