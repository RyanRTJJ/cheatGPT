woke up with a start, your heart racing as you sat up in your seat next to the plane. The last thing you remembered was glancing at your watch and seeing the time was 10:34 am, just before a deafening explosion ripped out the plane, sending debris flying everywhere. You had braced yourself for impact, but now you were still alive and unharmed.

Confused, you looked around at your fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be sleeping peacefully or engrossed in their in-flight entertainment. You glanced out the window and saw nothing but blue sky and fluffy white clouds. It was as if the explosion had never happened.

You reached for your watch and checked the time. To your surprise, it read 9:35 am. Had you been dreaming? It all felt so real.

As you tried to make sense of what had just happened, the captain's voice came over the intercom. "Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the slight turbulence. Our passengers are now seated with our belts fastened , we have safely passed through this patch of rough air."

Turbulence? You looked around and saw that no one else seemed to have noticed anything unusual. But the hum of the plane's engine did seem to have changed slightly, as if the plane was struggling to maintain its altitude.

You felt a chill run up your spine as you realized that something was not right. You glanced out the window again and saw that the sky had already begun to get dark, as though it was nighttime. But it was only 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was another loud noise, and it came from the engine. It sounded like a loud bang, followed by a hissing noise and then the pilot who was around you started to panic and scream as the plane began to lose altitude rapidly.

You scrambled to fasten your seat belt and braced yourself for impact. This time, you knew it was real.

As the plane crashed through the side of the runway you felt the pain in your head and everything went black. When you woke up again, you found yourself in the water, surrounded by debris from the plane. You realized that you were lucky to be alive, but the memory of the strange time jump and loss of time haunted you for the rest of your life.
