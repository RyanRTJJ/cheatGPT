I woke up feeling groggy, like any other morning. I rubbed my eyes and stretched my arms, trying to shake off the sleepiness. As I stumbled towards the bathroom, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror as the reflection of a double . My eyes widened as I saw the soft glow emanating from my fingertips. I looked down at my hands, and sure enough, they were emitting a bright blue light. I tried to shake it off, but the light only grew stronger. I had no idea what was happening to my hands. I went about my morning routine, unaware that my hands were growing stronger by the minute. My fingertips had the ability to create and manipulate light, and I was able to make it brighter or darker as I pleased. It was fascinating, but also a bit overwhelming.

I decided to take the train to New York to clear my head, but as soon as I got outside, I knew something was wrong. The world was in chaos, with cars overturned and it caught on fire. People were running in all directions, screaming and shouting in fear.

It didn't take me long to realize that I had been granted this power for a reason. I had the ability to help those in need and bring light to the darkness. I ran towards the nearest burning building and started reading the spells being used my powers to create a path of light, guiding people to my light. As I continued to use my powers to help those around me, I realized that this was my purpose. I had been given a gift, and it was time for me to use it for good. My day was filled with helping others, and I felt a sense of fulfillment and purpose that I had never experienced before.

As the sun set on a day like this, I looked up at the sky and felt a sense of peace inside. I didn't know what tomorrow would bring, but I knew that I was ready to face it with my newfound sense of fulfillment and purpose.
