woke up with a tingling sensation in your throat and heart racing as you sat down in your seat on the plane. The last thing you remembered was glancing at your watch ; the time was 10:34 am, just before a deafening explosion had rocked the plane, sending debris flying everywhere. You had braced yourself for impact, but now you were still alive and seemingly unharmed.

Confused, you looked around you at your fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be sleeping peacefully or engrossed in their in-flight entertainment. You stared out the window and saw nothing but the bright blue skies and fluffy white clouds. It was as if the explosion had never happened.

You reached for your watch and looked at the time. To your surprise, it was 4:00 am. Had you been dreaming? It all felt so real.

As you struggled to make sense of what had transpired, the captain's voice came over the intercom. "Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the slight turbulence. Please remain seated with your seat belts fastened until you have safely passed through this patch of rough air."

Turbulence? You looked around and saw that no one else seemed to have noticed anything unusual. But the sound of the plane's engine did seem to have changed slightly, as if it was struggling to maintain altitude.

You felt a chill run down your spine, and you realized that something was not right. You glanced out the window again and saw that the sky had turned dark, as if it was nighttime. But it was only 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was another sound, this time from a certain corner of your room. It sounded like a loud bang, followed by a hissing sound. People around you started to begin to scream as the plane began to lose altitude rapidly.

You suddenly remembered to fasten your seat belt and braced yourself for impact. This time, you knew it was real.

As the plane crashed into land, you felt a sharp pain in your head and everything went black. When you woke up again, you found yourself floating in the water, surrounded by debris from the plane. You suddenly realized that you were lucky to be alive, but the memory of the time jump and the explosion haunted you for the rest of your life.
