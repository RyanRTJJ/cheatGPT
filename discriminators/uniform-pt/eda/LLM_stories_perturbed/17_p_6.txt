Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who had the unique ability to control the reality of her dreams. In her dreams, she could fly, visit fantastical lands, and be anyone she wanted to be. Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she started to view her waking life as an empty world, waiting period between dreams.

Lily would spend her days in a daze, daydreaming about the adventures that awaited her in the middle of her dream. She stopped paying attention in class and stopped participating in activities with others. All she wanted was to sleep so she could enter her dream world again.

One day, while in the middle between dreams, Lily dreamt about something particularly exciting she heard a voice calling out to her. "Lily, wake up! You need to hear this!" Startled, she opened her eyes and found herself staring into the concerned face of her mother.

"What's wrong?" she asked, still groggy from sleep.

"I'm worried for you, Lily," her mother said. "You've been spending all your time sleeping and neglecting your responsibilities. You need to put in effort into your waking life too."

Lily brushed off her mother's concerns, insisting that her dreams were all that mattered. Her mother persisted, however, insisting that Lily knew that life was full of experiences and opportunities that she was missing out on by spending half of her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to see her mother's point. She started paying attention in class again, and even joined a few clubs at church. She found that , by taking action in every aspect of her waking life, she was able to do things that she had only ever dreamed of before.

Over time, Lily began to realize that life was just as exciting and full of possibilities as . She still looked forward to sleeping and controlling her dreams, but now she was also eager to see what each day would bring. She learned that life was worth the effort and that by putting in the work, she could achieve amazing things both in her waking life and in her dreams.
