Once upon a time, there was a little girl ... who had the unique ability to control every aspect of her waking life. Through her dreams, she could run and jump, fly, visit fantastical lands, and be anyone she wanted to be. Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she started to view her waking life as merely a waiting period between dreams.

Lily would spend her days in a daze, daydreaming about the adventures that awaited her in her next dream. She stopped learning new things in class and stopped participating in activities with the teachers. All she wanted was to sleep so she could discover her dream world again.

One day, while in the middle of a particularly exciting she heard a voice screaming to her. "Lily, wake up! You need to hear this!" Startled, she opened her eyes and found herself staring into the concerned face of her mother.

"What's wrong?" Lily asked, still groggy from sleep.

"I'm worried about you," her mother said. "You've been spending all your time sleeping and neglecting your responsibilities. You need to start putting in effort into your day to day life too."

Lily brushed off her mother's concerns, insisting that her dreams were all that mattered. But her mother grew increasingly frustrated, telling her that life was full of experiences and opportunities that she was missing out on by spending all her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to wake up, waking her mother's point. She started paying attention in class again, and even joined a few clubs at school. She soon realized that by putting in effort in her waking life, she was able to achieve things that she had only dreamed of before.

Over time, Lily began to realize that her life was just as exciting and full of possibilities as her dreams. She always looked forward to sleeping in her dreams, but now she was also eager to see what each day would bring. She learned that life was worth her effort and that by putting in the work, she could achieve amazing things both in her daily life and in her dreams.
