Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who had the unique ability to control every aspect of her life through dreams. In her dreams, she could travel far off places, visit fantastical lands, and be anyone she wanted to be. Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she started to view her life everyday as merely a waiting , her dreams.

Lily would spend her days in a daze, daydreaming of the adventures that awaited her in her next dream. She stopped participating in class and stopped participating in the fun she had with her friends. All she wanted was to sleep so she could enter her dream world again.

One day, while in the middle of a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice calling out to her. "Lily, wake up! You 've had better hear this!" Startled, Lily opened her eyes and found herself staring into the concerned face of her mother.

"What's wrong?" she asked, still groggy from sleep.

"I'm worried about you, Lily," her mother said. "You've been spending all your time sleeping and neglecting your responsibilities. You need to start putting in effort into your waking life too."

Lily brushed off the concerns, insisting that she was no longer a child and that her dreams were all real. But her mother persisted, telling her that life was full of experiences and opportunities that she would be missing out on by spending all her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to see her mother's point. She started paying attention in class again, and joined a few clubs at her local gym. She quickly found that by putting in effort in every day of her waking life, she was able to achieve things that she had only ever dreamed of before.

Over time, Lily began to realize that life is as exciting and full of possibilities as her dreams. She still looked forward to sleeping every night and dreaming her dreams, but now she was also eager to see what the next day would bring. She learned that life was worth her effort and that by putting in the work, she could achieve amazing things both in her waking life and in her dreams.
