You woke up with a start, your heart racing as you hurried up in your seat on the plane. The last thing you remembered was checking your watch and seeing the time was 10:34 am, just before a deafening explosion had rocked the airport, sending debris flying everywhere. You had braced yourself for impact, but now you were fine and seemingly unharmed.

Confused, you looked around the airplane at fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be sleeping peacefully or engrossed in their in-flight entertainment. You glanced out the window and saw nothing but a flat, blue sky and fluffy white clouds. It was as if the explosion had never happened.

You reached for your watch to check the time. To your surprise, it showed 9:35 . What had happened? Had you been dreaming? It all felt so real.

As you tried to make sense of what had just happened, the captain's voice came over the intercom. "Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the slight turbulence. Please remain seated keep our seat belts fastened until we have safely passed through this patch of rough air."

Turbulence? You looked around and saw that no one seemed to have noticed anything unusual. But the hum of the plane's engine did seem to have changed slightly, as though it was struggling to maintain altitude.

You felt a . Silence ran down your spine as you realized that something was not right. You glanced out the window again and saw that the sky had turned dark, as if it was nighttime. But it was only 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was another loud noise, this time coming from your engine. It sounded like a loud bang, made a hissing sound. People and passengers around you started to panic , as the plane began to lose altitude rapidly.

You quickly decided to fasten your seat belt and braced yourself for impact. This time, you knew it was real.

As the plane crashed into the ocean, you felt a sharp pain in your head and everything went black. When you woke up , you were floating in the water, surrounded by debris from the plane. You realized that you were lucky to be alive, but the memory of the strange time jump and the explosion haunted you for the rest of your life.
