John had always been fascinated with the idea of immortality. He had spent years researching and experimenting in his own laboratory and finally, he had done it. He had discovered the mysterious secret of immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the incredible things that he could accomplish now that he had all the time in the world. But suddenly, kneed before him, handing him the card with a message. "When you get tired of living in that box of forever sucks, call this number. I've got a job offer for you."

John was confused but intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death would offer him a job, but he decided to keep the card and continue with his newfound immortality.

At first, John was thrilled with his newfound longevity. He traveled the world, learned new skills, and amassed a fortune. But as time went on, John came to realize that living forever wasn't as easy as he thought it would be.

He watched as his loved ones aged and passed away, leaving him alone in a world that was constantly changing. He saw wars and disasters he could do nothing to prevent. It made him feel like a prisoner in his own body, unable to escape the monotony of endless days.

It was then that John remembered the business card Death had given him. He decided to call the number, curious to find out what kind of job offer Death could have for an immortal figure as immortal as himself.

To his surprise, Death answered the phone, he was calm and reassuring. "I knew you would call eventually," he said. "I have a job offer for you, John. I need someone to help me manage the afterlife, someone who understands what it's like to live in the world and John just couldnâ€™t believe all that he was hearing. But as Death explained the reality of the job, John realized that this was exactly what he had been looking for. He could finally use his immortality to help others, to guide them through the afterlife and ensure that they found peace.

And so, John accepted the job offer and began the new chapter of his endless life. He no longer felt like he held his immortality but used it as a tool to help others find their way. And though he still missed his mortal friends and family, he knew that he was where he was meant to be.
