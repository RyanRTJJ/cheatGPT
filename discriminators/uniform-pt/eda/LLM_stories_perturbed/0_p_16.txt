John had always been fascinated with the idea of immortality. He had spent many months researching and experimenting in his basement laboratory, and finally, he had done it. He had discovered the secret to immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the incredible things he could accomplish now that he had unlimited time in the future. But suddenly, Death appeared before him, handing him a business card with a cryptic message. The message read, "If you realize living forever sucks, call this number. I've got a job for you."

John was confused but intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death would offer him a job, but he decided to keep the card and continue with his newfound immortality.

At first, John was thrilled with his newfound longevity. He traveled the world, learned new languages, and even amassed a fortune. But as time went on, John realized that living forever wasn't as wonderful as he had thought it would be.

He watched as his loved ones aged and passed away, and the old man felt alone in a world that was constantly changing. He saw wars and disasters that he could do nothing to prevent. He felt like a prisoner in his own thoughts and didn't know how to escape the cycle of endless days.

It was then that John remembered the business card Death had given him, and decided to call the number, curious to see what kind of feeling Death could have for an immortal man like himself.

To his surprise, Death answered the phone, his voice calm and serious. "I knew you would call eventually," he said. "I have a job offer for you." Death nodded again. I need someone to help me manage the afterlife, someone who understands what it's like to live forever."

John couldn't believe what he was hearing. But as Death explained the details of his job, John realized that this was exactly what he had been looking for in his previous life. He could finally use his immortality to help others, to guide them through the afterlife and ensure that they found peace.

And and with that, John accepted the job offer and began a new chapter of his life. He no longer felt so enmeshed in his immortality but instead embraced it as a tool to help others find their way. And though he still missed his mortal friends and family, he knew that he was where he was meant to be.
