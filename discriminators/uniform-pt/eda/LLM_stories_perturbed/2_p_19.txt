As I walked through the dark est streets and alleys of the city, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and my heart raced with every step. It was then that I had it - a rip in time, hovering in front of me like someone escorting me to another world.

Without a second thought, I stepped through the rip and found myself on a metal table. My head went spinning as I tried to make sense of my surroundings. The room was dimly lit and sterile, with surgical instruments neatly arranged on a table next to me.

As I tried to move, I noticed that my arms and legs were strapped down. Panic set in as I struggled against the restraints, but they held fast. That's when I heard footsteps approaching.

A figure dressed in black entered the room, their face obscured by a surgical mask. They picked up one of the instruments and approached me, their movements precise and deliberate. My heart throbbed so loudly in my chest as they began to make incisions into my flesh with skillful precision.

I screamed out in agony as they worked, but the figure remained tranquil and focused. Minutes passed, and I felt myself growing weaker by the second. Just as I thought it was all over, the ambulance stopped and stepped away, leaving me bleeding and alone on the ground. I lay there, gasping for breath, wondering what had just happened. It was only when I managed to wrench myself free from that clutched grip that I realized the truth . We had been transported to a future where medical science had reached unimaginable heights.

But at what cost? As I stumbled out of the room and into the bright, sterile light of the future, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had been violated that much deeper and that went beyond physical pain. The point in time that had brought me there had torn a hole in my very soul, and I knew that I would never truly return to the life I had known before.
