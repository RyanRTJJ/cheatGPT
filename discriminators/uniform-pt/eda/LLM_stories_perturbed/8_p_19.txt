As a child, Sarah always felt out of place. She struggled to make friends , and found solace in reading fantasy and the supernatural. It wasn't until her teenage years that she discovered her true nature as a witch, and suddenly everything made sense.

But being a witch wasn't easy. Society didn't accept her, and she was often ostracized and bullied. So when Sarah stumbled upon a spell that promised to give her the power to make the world love her, she couldn't resist.

The spell worked, but it came with a dark cost. Sarah was unable to admit how the love she received was not genuine, but forced. She had become a puppet pulling the strings of people's hearts to suit her own desires.

For years, Sarah used her power to manipulate those around her, always thirsting for a woman... But as time went on, she began to feel a deep emptiness within her. She realized that true love and connection could never be forced, only earned.

Desperate to break down the curse that she was put on herself, Sarah searched for a way to disarm her magic. And that's when she discovered the ancient ritual that promised to lift the curse, but only through the sacrifice of an innocent life.

Sarah struggled with the decision for weeks, but ultimately her desire for redemption won out. And so, she lured an unsuspecting victim to her home and performed the ritual, watching anxiously as the life drained from the innocent person before her.

As the curse was lifted and Sarah's power faded away, she was left with a newfound sense of guilt and shame. She had become the monster she had been, and there was no going back now. Not wishing to accept her regrets, Sarah knew that she had to face the consequences of her actions. And so, she turned herself in to the authorities, ready to face whatever punishment awaited her. But even in the depths of her depravity, she knew that she could never truly escape the horror of what she had done.
