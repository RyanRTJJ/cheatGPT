Jenna had always been fascinated by the blacksmith's craft. As a child, she loved watching her father work the forge, hammering red-hot metal into beautiful, intricate shapes. But when she expressed an interest in learning the trade herself, he had scoffed.

"Blacksmithing is not your thing," he said. "It's a man's job."

Jenna didn't even matter. She knew she had what it took to be a great blacksmith. And so, when she was 15 years old she left home and traveled to the nearest city, where she found work as an apprentice to a master blacksmith.

The work was hard, but she loved it. She learned how to bend and shape iron with the hammer and anvil, to create beautiful works of art from nothing but fire. She also learned to work with flame, using it to heat the metal to just the right temperature before shaping it with her hammer.

Over the years, she refined her skills, becoming one of the best metal sculptors in the city. People came from all around to commission her to create beautiful pieces for them. She crafted everything from simple hooks and hinges to elaborate swords and armor.

One day, a wealthy client approached Jenna with a special request. He wanted her to create a set of iron gates for his mansion, gates that would be both beautiful and strong enough to keep out unwanted guests.

Jenna accepted the challenge, and set to work. After weeks, she toiled over the gates, heating the metal in the forge and shaping it with her hammer. She used every trick she had learned over the years, working the metal with precision and care.

When she finished, the gates were almost perfect. They were strong and sturdy, yet delicate and beautiful at the same time. The merchant was thrilled with them, and paid Jenna handsomely for the privilege. As Jenna watched the gates being installed at the mansion, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. Through her hands and the flame, she had created something truly amazing. And she knew that she had proved her father wrong - blacksmithing was not just a job.
