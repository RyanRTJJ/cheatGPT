As I walked through the dark and dingy alleys of the city, I began to get the feeling that I was being watched. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and my heart raced with every step. It was then that I saw it - the door in front of me. Just in time, hovering in front of me like an invitation to another world.

Without a second thought, I stepped through the door and found myself on a cold, metal table. My head spun as I tried to make sense of my surroundings. The room was dimly lit and sterile, with surgical instruments neatly arranged on a table next to me.

As I tried to take my place, I realized that my arms and legs were being held down. Panic set in as I struggled against the restraints, but they proved too much. That's when I heard the footsteps approaching.

A figure dressed in white entered the room, their face obscured by a surgical mask. They picked me up from the ground, stood on the corner of the room and approached me, their movements precise and deliberate. My heart pounded in my chest as they began to make incisions, cutting into my flesh with skillful precision.

I screamed out in agony while they worked, but the figure remained stoic and focused. Minutes passed, and I found myself growing weaker by the second. Just as I thought it was all over, the figure stopped and stepped away, leaving me bleeding and alone on the beach. I just lay there, taking a breath, unsure of what had just happened. It was only when I managed to wrench myself free from the grasp of a trance and I realized the truth - I had been transported to a future where medical science had advanced to unimaginable heights.

But at what cost? As I stumbled out of the room and into the bright, new world of the future, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had been violated in ways that had brought me more grief than physical pain. The rip in time that had brought me there was a hole in my very soul, and I knew with certainty that I could never truly return to the life I had known before.
