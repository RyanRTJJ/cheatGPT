The alien overlord, Zaxar, was in a panic. He had sent his best troops to invade Earth and had given them his most advanced weapons to destroy the puny humans. But now, he was receiving reports that their assault was failing.

"What do you mean they ate our ammunition?" Zaxar asked his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the humans have developed a taste for our weaponry, and have been consuming it instead of being trained to use it."

Zaxar's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's impossible. How can they eat our weapons?"

Gorg cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that the humans have been eating our genetically modified crops that can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been fed the crops to human livestock, and now the humans themselves have developed a taste for them."

Zaxar rubbed his scaly chin, but it was hard to ignore the thought. He had not anticipated this development. His fleet had been conquering other planets for thousands of years, but never had they encountered a species that could consume their weapons.

"Very well," Zaxar added. "We will need to adapt our strategy. Gorg, send a message to our scientists and develop a new kind of weapon that the humans will not be torn apart by. We will not be defeated through a new race of beings who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's orders, the alien overlord couldn't help but get a sense of grudging cooperation from the humans. They were fighting fiercely, but their determination to survive was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
