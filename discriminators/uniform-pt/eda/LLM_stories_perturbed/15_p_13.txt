The alien overlord, Zaxar, was furious. He had sent his robots to invade Earth and had given them the most advanced weapons on Earth to crush the lives of the puny humans. But now, he was receiving reports that their assault was failing.

"What do you mean they ate our ammunition?" Zaxar bellowed at his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems the humans have developed a taste for our weaponry, sir. They've been consuming it instead of being destroyed by it."

Zaxar's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's impossible. How can they eat our weapons?"

Gorg cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that the irradiated population has been experimenting with genetically modified crops that can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been feeding these crops to their livestock, and now the humans have developed a way to eat them."

Zaxar rubbed his scaly chin, deep in thought. He had never encountered this alien world before. His fleet had been conquering other planets for centuries, and never had they encountered a species that could attack them by eating their metal weapons.

"Very well," Garak said. "We will need to adapt our strategy. Gorg, send one to our scientists to develop a new kind of weapon that they cannot eat. We will not be defeated by a race of beings who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's fierce alien overlord couldn't help but feel a sense of grudging respect for the humans. They were hardworking, determined, resourceful, and their determination to survive was most impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
