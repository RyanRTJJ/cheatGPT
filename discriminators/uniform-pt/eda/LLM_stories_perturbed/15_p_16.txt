The starfinder, Zaxar, was furious. He had sent his best troops to invade Earth and had given them the most advanced weapons to defeat the puny humans. But now, he seemed to be receiving reports that their supplies were failing.

"What do you mean they ate our ammunition?" Zaxar bellowed at his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems the humans have developed a taste for our weaponry, sir. They've been consuming it instead of being destroyed by it."

Zaxar's face turned pale in disbelief. "That's impossible. How can they have grown a taste for our weapons?"

Gorg cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that the humans have been experimenting with genetically modified bacteria. They can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been feeding these critters to their livestock, and the humans themselves have developed a taste for them."

Zaxar rubbed his scaly chin, deep in thought. He had not anticipated this development. The Enterprise had been conquering other planets for centuries, and never had they encountered a species that could consume metal well," Zaxar finally said. "We will need to adapt our strategy. Gorg, send a message to our scientists to develop a new kind of material that the humans cannot eat. We will not be defeated by a race of beings able to consume only metal."

As Gorg scientists worked to relay Zaxar's orders, his alien overlord couldn't help but feel a sense of grudging respect for the humans. They were resourceful, and their determination to survive was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
