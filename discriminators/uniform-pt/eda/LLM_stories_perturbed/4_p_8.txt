You woke up with a start, your heart racing as you woke up in your room in front of the plane. The last thing you remembered was glancing at your watch and seeing the time was 10:34 am, just before the explosion had rocked the plane, sending debris spiraling to the side. You had braced yourself for impact, but now you were still alive and seemingly unharmed.

Confused, you looked around to see your fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be sleeping peacefully or engrossed in their reading. You glanced out the window and saw nothing but blue sky and fluffy white clouds. It was almost as if the explosion had never happened.

You reached for your watch and checked the time. To your surprise, it read 9:35 am. Had you been dreaming? It all felt very familiar. As you tried to make sense of what had just happened, the captain's voice came over the intercom. "Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the slight inconvenience." Everyone requested to remain seated with your seat belts fastened until we have safely passed through your zone of rough air."

Turbulence? You looked around and saw that no one else seemed to have noticed anything unusual. But the sound of the plane's engine seemed to have changed slightly, as if it was trying to maintain altitude.

You felt a . Something shivered down your spine as you realized that something was not right. You glanced out the window and saw that the sky was dark, as if it was nighttime. But it was only 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was another loud noise, this time from the engine. It sounded like a loud bang, followed by a loud hissing sound. People around you started to panic , as you began to lose altitude rapidly.

You scrambled to fasten your seat belt and braced yourself for impact. This time, you knew it was real.

As the airplane crashed into the ocean, you felt a sharp pain in your head and everything went black. When you woke up again, you were floating in the water, surrounded by debris from the plane. You knew you were lucky to be alive, but the memory of the strange time jump and the explosion remains for the rest of your life.
