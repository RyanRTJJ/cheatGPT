As a former commander of NASA, I've always known that the Earth is flat. It's a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few within the American scientific community.

So when the President asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this a secret is because it would cause mass panic and chaos if the public were to learn the truth," I said. "But why would that be?" the President asked, thoroughly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would completely undermine our understanding of the scientific method and the laws of physics," I said. "It would also raise a lot of questions about our place in the world and our purpose as a species."

The President nodded thoughtfully. "I see your point," he said. "But do you think the public has a right to know the truth?"

I sighed. "Yes, of course they do. But we need to be careful about how we reveal this information. We need to make sure that people understand this and are fully aware of what it means for our world."

The President nodded again, and I could tell he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information ," he said.

As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping a big secret for so long, but I think we were doing the right thing by keeping the truth hidden for now. Perhaps one day, when humanity is ready, we can discover the truth and begin to explore the mysteries of our flat Earth.
