John had always been fascinated with the idea of immortality. He had spent years researching and experimenting in his basement laboratory, but now he had done it. He had discovered the secret to immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the incredible things he could do now that he had all the time in the world. But suddenly, Death appeared before him, handing him a business card with a message. "When you realize living forever sucks, call this number. I've got a job offer for you."

John was a little intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death offered him a job, but he decided to keep his eyes out for any further questions or further action, and continue with his newfound immortality.

At first, John was excited about his newfound longevity. He traveled the world, learned many new things and amassed a fortune. But as time went on, John realized that living forever wasn't as easy as he had thought it would be, especially as his loved ones aged and passed away, leaving him alone in a world that was constantly changing. He saw wars brewing around him that he could do nothing to prevent. He felt like a prisoner in his own body, unable to escape the monotony of endless days.

It was then that John remembered the business card Death had given him. He decided to call . Death seemed curious as to what . It seemed like the best job offer Death could have for an immortal man like himself.

To his credit, Death answered the phone, his voice soothing and reassuring. "I knew you would call eventually," he said. "I have a job offer for you, John. I need someone to help me manage the afterlife, someone who understands what it's like to live to believe what he heard. But as Death explained the details of the job, John realized that this was exactly what he had been looking for. He could finally use his immortality to help others, to guide them through the afterlife and ensure that they found peace.

And so, John accepted the job offer and began a new chapter in his endless life. He no longer felt trapped in his immortality but instead embraced it as a tool to help others find their own. Even though he still missed his mortal friends and family, he knew that he was where he was meant to be.
