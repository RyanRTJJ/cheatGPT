John had always been fascinated with the idea of immortality. He had spent years researching and experimenting in his basement laboratory, and finally, he had done it. He had discovered the secret to immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the great things he could accomplish now that he had all the time in the world. But suddenly, spoke before him, handing him a business card with a cryptic message; "When you realize living forever sucks, call this number. I've got a job offer ." Death was confused but intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death would offer him a job, but he decided to keep the card and continue with his newfound when John was thrilled with his newfound longevity. He traveled the world, learned new skills and amassed a fortune. But as time went on, he began to think that living forever wasn't as wonderful as he had thought it would be.

He watched as his loved ones aged and passed away, leaving him to take over a world that was constantly changing. There were wars and disasters that he could do nothing to prevent. He felt like a prisoner in his own body, unable to shake the monotony of endless days.

It was then that he remembered the business card Death had given him. He hurried to call the number, curious to see what kind of job offer Death could have for an individual like himself.

To his surprise, Death answered the phone, his voice calm and reassuring. "I knew you would understand," he explained. "I have a job offer for you, John. I need someone to help me manage the afterlife, someone who understands what his journey might be like to live forever."

John couldn't believe what he was hearing. But as Death explained the details of her incredible job, John realized that it was exactly what he had been searching for. He could finally use his immortality to help others, to guide them through the afterlife and ensure that they found peace.

And so, John accepted the job offer and began a new chapter of his endless life. He no longer felt trapped by immortality but instead embraced it as a tool to help others on their way. And though he still missed his mortal friends and family, he was reassured that he was where he was meant to be.
