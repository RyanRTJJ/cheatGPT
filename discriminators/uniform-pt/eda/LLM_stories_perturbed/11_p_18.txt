Jacob was a curious boy with a wild imagination. He loved to explore the world around him, but there were some things he just couldn't understand. The concept of death, death, and ghosts was something that left him feeling confused and scared.

One day, Jacob decided to take matters into his own hands. He put on his favorite astronaut costume and stepped out into the atmosphere as a space explorer on a mission to find answers to the questions that troubled him. As he donned his helmet and climbed into his cockpit (a cardboard box with holes cut out for windows), he felt a sense of control over the unknown.

With his trusty rocket ship in tow, he set out to unravel the mysteries of the universe. He floated past planets and stars, marveling at the vastness of it all. As he navigated his way through the cosmos, he encountered other beings, some friendly, some not so much. But no matter what obstacles he faced, Jacob always found a way to use his quick thinking and bravery to overcome them. In the end, Jacob returned home feeling more confident as a young person than ever before. When he realized that he might not have all the answers he was searching for, but he was determined to keep exploring and learning. And whenever he encountered a concept or situation that he couldn't understand, he knew that he could always put on his astronaut suit and take to space where he could find a sense of peace and control in the unknown.
