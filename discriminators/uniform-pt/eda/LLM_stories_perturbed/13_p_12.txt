As a young wizarding girl, Amara had always dreamed of a career for the Ministry of Magic. She had imagined herself casting powerful spells and making decisions that would shape the wizarding world. But as it turned out, her job at the Ministry was quite different from what she had expected.

Amara's official title was "Spell Seeker." Her job was to spend a full day saying the words of spells in search of undiscovered spells. It was a tedious task, to say the least. Amara would sit in a small room, surrounded by books and parchments, and recite words like "flibbertigibbet" and "ballyhoo" over and over again, hoping that one of them would trigger her spell.

Most days, Amara found herself feeling bored and frustrated. She wondered if she had made a mistake in choosing this career path. But then, one afternoon, something incredible happened.

As Amara was reciting the word "hocus pocus" for what felt like the thousandth time, she felt a strange sensation in her hand and a bright light shot out of her wand, illuminating the entire room. Amara had stumbled upon a new spell!

Excitedly, she wrote down the incantation and rushed to the Head of the Department of Research to share her discovery. The Head was skeptical at first, but after Amara demonstrated the spell, he was impressed.

From then on, Amara's job became more exciting. She spent her days experimenting with new words and discovering new spells that had never been seen before. Her work was groundbreaking and soon gained recognition throughout the world. A thousand years later, Amara would look back on her days as a Spell Seeker with fondness. She realized that it was the patience and persistence she learned in school that had allowed her to make such a significant contribution to the magical community. And although the work was tedious at times, it was all worth it in the end.
