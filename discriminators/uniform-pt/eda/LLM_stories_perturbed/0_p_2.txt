John had always been fascinated by the idea of immortality. He had spent years researching and experimenting in his basement laboratory, and finally, he had come up with the answer. He had discovered the secret to immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the incredible things he could accomplish now that he had all the time in the world. But suddenly, , before sending him a business card with a cryptic message. "When you realize living forever sucks, call this number. I've got a job offer for you."

John was confused but intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death would offer him a job, but he decided to keep the card and continue with his newfound immortality.

At first, John was so excited about his newfound longevity. He traveled the world, learned new skills, and amassed a fortune. However, as time went on, John realized that living forever wasnâ€™t quite as wonderful as he had thought it would be as his loved ones aged and passed away, leaving him alone in a world that was constantly changing. He saw wars that would never be won, that he could do nothing to prevent. John felt like a prisoner in his own body, unable to escape the monotony of endless days.

It was then that John remembered the business card Death had given him. He decided to call the number, curious to see what kind of love Death could have for an immortal man like himself.

To his credit, Death answered the phone, his voice calm and reassuring. "I knew you would call eventually," he said. "I have an offer for you, John. I need someone to help me manage the afterlife, someone who has lived it and knows what it's like to live forever."

John couldn't believe what he was hearing. But as Death explained the details of the afterlife, John decided that this was exactly what he had been looking for - a way that John could finally use his immortality to help others, to guide them through the afterlife and ensure that they found peace.

And so, John accepted the job offer and beginning a new chapter of his endless life. He no longer felt trapped by his immortality but instead embraced it as a tool to help others find their way. And though he still missed his mortal friends and family, he knew that he was where he was meant to be.
