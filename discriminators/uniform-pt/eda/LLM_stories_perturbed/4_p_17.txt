You woke up with a start, your head spinning as you sat in your seat on the plane. The last thing you remembered was looking at your watch and seeing the time was 10:34 am, just before a deafening explosion had rocked the plane, sending debris flying everywhere. No matter what you braced yourself for impact, but now you were still alive and unharmed.

Confused, you looked around at your fellow passengers, many of whom seemed to be sleeping peacefully or immersed in their in-flight entertainment. You glanced out the window and saw nothing but blue sky and fluffy white clouds that could barely be seen. It was as if the explosion had never happened.

You reached for your compasses and checked the time. To your horror, it read 9:35 am. Had you been dreaming? It all felt so real.

As you tried to make sense of what had just happened, the captain's voice called over the intercom. "Ladies and gentlemen, we apologise for the slight turbulence. Please remain seated with your seat belts, until we have safely passed through this patch of rough air."

Turbulence? You looked around you and found that nobody else seemed to have noticed anything unusual. But the hum of the plane's engine did seem to have stopped, as if it was struggling to maintain altitude.

You felt a chill run down your spine as you realized that something was very wrong with the car. You glanced out of the window again and saw that the sky had turned dark, as it was nighttime. But it was only 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was another loud noise, this time from the engine. It sounded like a loud bang, followed by a hissing sound. People around you began to panic and scream as the plane began to lose altitude rapidly.

You scrambled to fasten your seat belt and braced yourself for impact. This time, you knew the accident was real.

As the plane crashed into the ocean, you felt a sharp pain in your head and everything went black. When you woke up again, you were floating in the water, surrounded by debris from the plane. You realized that you were lucky to be alive, but the memories of the strange time jump and the explosion haunted you for the rest of your life.
