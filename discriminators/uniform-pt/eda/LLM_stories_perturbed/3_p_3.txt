For as long as he could remember, he always had the same recurring dream. Every night, he would find himself wandering through a fantastical world filled with strange creatures and towering castles. And every time, he would be joined by a strange girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She never introduced herself, but over time, they became close friends, exploring the dream world together and sharing secrets and stories.

As Tyler grew older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got a job again and started building a good life for himself. But he never forgot . He had the girl from his dreams, and sometimes he would just sit down and start daydreaming about her.

One day, while walking through the park, Tyler saw her. The girl from his dreams. She was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he must be imagining things, but as he got closer, he could see that it was really her. She looked older, almost wiser, but the infectious laugh and mischievous smile were still there.

Tyler walked up to her and said hello, but she just looked at him with a blank expression, as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to her memory, reminding her of their adventures in the dream . But she just shook her head and said she had to go.

For weeks, Tyler tried to find her again, but she seemed to be avoiding him. Finally, one day, he managed to catch her alone. He asked her why why she was acting so strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him with sad eyes and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I can't explain it to you. It's not like that now. It's too complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more information, but she refused to share anything else. As she walked away, he couldn't help feeling a sense of loss. The girl from his dreams had been real all along, but now she seemed to be slipping away from him once again.

For months, Tyler tried to forget about her, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something important he needed to tell her. Then, one night, he had a dream. In it, he was back in the fantastical world, and there she was, the girl from his dreams, waiting for him.

As they explored the dream world once again, she explained everything to him. She was a traveler , a guide who helped people navigate the complexities of the place. Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she had been tasked with guiding through all her mysteries. But now that he was an adult, it was time for her to move on to other responsibilities.

Tyler woke up , both relieved and saddened. He had finally gotten the answers he had been seeking, even though he knew he would never see her again. As he went about his day, he couldn't help but feel grateful for all the moments they had shared together, both in his dreams and in a few brief moments of reality.
