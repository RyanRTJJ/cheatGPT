As the head of NASA, I've always known that the Earth is far away from its nearest neighbors. It's a well-guarded secret, known only by a select few within the government and scientific community.

So when the incoming President asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason for keeping this a secret is because it would cause mass panic and uncertainty if the public were to learn about this," I explained.

"But why would that be?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would completely undermine our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics," I said. "It would also raise a lot of questions about our place in the world and our purpose as Americans." The Vice President nodded thoughtfully. "I see your point," he said. "But don't you agree that the public has a right to know the truth?"

I sighed. "Yes, of course they do. But we need to think differently about how we reveal . We need to make sure that people understand the implications of what it means for our world."

The President nodded again, and I could tell he was starting to ponder my thought. "Thank you for your time and for sharing this information with me," he said.

As he left the meeting, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for so long, but I knew that we were doing the kindest thing by keeping the truth hidden for now. Perhaps one day, when humanity is ready, we can reveal ourselves here and really explore the mysteries of our flat Earth.
