As I moved my way through the dark and dingy alleys of the city, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and my heart pounded hard with every step. It was then that I saw it - a rip in time, hovering in front of me like a portal to another world.

Without a second â€™s hesitation I stepped inside the rip e little lab and found myself on a cold, metal table. My head spun as I tried to make sense of my surroundings. The room was dimly lit and sterile, with surgical instruments neatly arranged on a table next to me. As I tried to stand, I realized that my arms and legs were strapped down. Panic set in as I struggled against the restraints, but they held fast. That's when I heard the footsteps approaching.

A figure dressed in white entered the room, their black shoes replaced by a surgical mask. They picked up one of the instruments and approached me, their movements precise and deliberate. My heart pounded in my chest as they started to make incisions, cutting into my flesh with skillful precision.

I could hear them writhe in agony as they worked, but the figure remained stoic and focused. Minutes passed, I felt myself growing weaker by the second. Just as I thought it was beginning to pass, the figure stopped and stepped away, leaving me bleeding and alone on the table.

I remember gasping for breath, unsure of what had just happened. It was only when I managed to It wasn't until I was finally free from the restraints that I realized the truth - I had been transported to a future where medical science had advanced to unimaginable heights.

But at what cost? As I stumbled out of the room and into the enchanted light of the future, I couldn't shake the feeling that had been violated in ways that went beyond physical pain. The rip in time that brought me there had slit a hole in my very soul, and I knew that I could never truly return to the life I had known before.
