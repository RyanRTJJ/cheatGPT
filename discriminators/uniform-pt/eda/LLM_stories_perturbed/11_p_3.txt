Jacob was a curious boy with a curious mind. He loved to explore the world around him, but there were some things he just couldn't understand. The concept of death, for instance, was something that left him feeling confused and scared.

One day, Jacob decided to take on the notion of dying on his own He put on his favorite astronaut costume and declared himself a spaceman on a mission to find answers to the questions that troubled him. As he donned his helmet and climbed into his makeshift spaceship (a cardboard box with holes cut out for windows), he felt a sense of control over the unknown.

With his trusty rocket ship in hand, he set out to explore the mysteries of the universe. He floated past planets and stars, marveling at the vastness of it all. As he navigated his way through the galaxy he encountered many unknowns -- some friendly, some not so much. But no matter what obstacles he faced, Jacob always found a way to use his quick thinking and bravery to overcome them.

In the end, Jacob walked away from his journey feeling more confident and empowered than ever before. He knew that he might not have all the answers he was searching for, but he was determined to keep exploring and learning. And whenever he encountered a concept or situation that he could not fully understand, he knew he could always put on his astronaut suit and take a trip to the stars, where he would find a sense of peace and control in the unknown.
