You woke up with a start, your heart racing as you remembered the noise in your stomach from the plane. The last thing you remembered was glancing at your watch and seeing the time reading 10:34 am, just before a deafening explosion had rocked the cabin, debris flying everywhere. You had braced yourself for impact, but now you were still alive and breathing. As night fell, you looked around at your fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be sleeping peacefully or engrossed in in-flight entertainment. You looked out the window and saw nothing but blue skies and fluffy white clouds. It was as if the explosion had never happened.

You reached for your watch and checked the time. To your surprise, it read 9:35 pm! Had you been dreaming? It all felt so real.

As you tried to make sense of what had just happened, another voice came over the intercom. "Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the slight turbulence. Please remain seated with your seat belts fastened until we have safely passed through this patch of rough air."

Turbulence? You looked around and saw that no one else seemed to have noticed . But the sound of the plane's engine did seem to have changed slightly, as if it was struggling to maintain altitude.

You felt a chill run down your spine as you realized that something was not right. You glanced out the window again and saw that the sky had turned dark, as if it had suddenly turned nighttime. But it was only 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was another loud noise, this time from the kitchen sink. It sounded like a loud bang, followed by a churn of noise. People around began to panic and panicked as the plane began to lose altitude rapidly.

You scrambled to fasten your seat belt and braced yourself for impact. This time, you knew this feeling was real.

As the plane crashed into the ocean, you felt a sharp pain in your head and everything went black. When you woke up again, you were floating in the water, surrounded by debris from a huge explosion. You realized that you were lucky to be alive, but the memory of the strange time after the explosion haunted you for the rest of your life.
