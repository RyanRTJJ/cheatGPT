John had always been fascinated with the idea of immortality. He had spent years researching and experimenting in his basement laboratory, and finally, he had done it. He had kept the information secret . John thought of all the incredible things he could accomplish now that he had all the time in the world. But suddenly, Death appeared before him, handing him a card with a cryptic message. "When you realize living forever sucks, dial my phone number. I've got a job offer for you!" Dark had to smile, confused but intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death would offer him a job, so he decided to keep the card and continue with his newfound immortality.

At first, John enjoyed the freedom that came with his newfound longevity. He traveled the world, learned new skills, and even made a fortune. But as time went on, John realized that living forever wasn't as wonderful as he had thought it would be.

He watched as his loved ones aged and died, leaving him alone in a world that was constantly changing. He saw wars and disasters that he could do nothing to prevent. He felt like a prisoner in his own body, incapable of finding a way to escape the monotony of endless days.

It was then that John remembered the business number I had given him. He decided to call the number, curious to see what kind of job offer Death could have for an immortal man like himself.

To his surprise, Death answered the phone â€“ his voice calm and reassuring. "I thought you would call eventually," he said. "I have a job offer , John. I need someone to help me manage the afterlife, someone who understands what it's like to live forever."

John couldn't believe what he was hearing. But as Death explained the details of the job, John realized that death had come for John, and this was exactly what he had been looking for. He could use his immortality to help others, to guide them to the afterlife and ensure that they found peace.

And John accepted the job offer and an entirely new chapter of his endless life. He no longer felt trapped in his mortal body but instead embraced it as a tool to help others find their way. And though he still missed his mortal friends and family, he knew that he was where he was meant to be.
