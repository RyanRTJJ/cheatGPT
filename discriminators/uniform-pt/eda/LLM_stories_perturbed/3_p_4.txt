For as long as he could remember, Tyler had always had the same dream. In it, he would find himself wandering through a vast, wonderful fantasy world filled with strange creatures and towering castles. And every time, he would be met by a strange girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She never introduced herself, but over time, they became friends, exploring the dream world together and sharing secrets with each other. As Tyler grew older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got a job, and started building a life for himself. But he never forgot about her from his dreams, and sometimes he would catch himself daydreaming about her.

One day, while walking through the park, Tyler saw her. She was not from his dreams. She was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he must be imagining things, but as he but he could see that it was really her. She looked older, of course, but the sparkling eyes and flirtatious smile were still there.

Tyler walked up to her and said hello, but she just looked at him with a vague suspicion in her eye, as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding her of their adventures in the previous town, but she just shook her head and said she had to go.

For weeks, he tried to find her again, but she seemed to be avoiding him. Finally, one day, he managed to catch her alone. He asked her why she was acting so strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at Tyler with sad eyes and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I can't explain it right now. It's too complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more information about him, but she refused to say anything else. As she walked away, he couldn't help feeling a sense of loss. The girl from his dreams had been real all along, but now she seemed to be slipping away from him once again.

For months, Tyler tried to forget about her, but he couldn't shake the feeling she was here, that he was missing. Then, one night, he had a dream. In it, he was back in her world, and there was the girl from his dreams, waiting for him.

As they explored the dream world once again, she finally explained everything to him. She was a traveler between the universes, and a guide who helped people navigate the complexities of the multiverse. Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she had been tasked with guiding through his dreams. But now he was an adult, it was time for her to pass on to other responsibilities.

Tyler woke up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had finally gotten the answers he had been , and one he knew he would never have again. As he went about his day, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the time they had shared together, both in dreams and in the brief moments of reality.
