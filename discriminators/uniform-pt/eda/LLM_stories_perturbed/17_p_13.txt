Once upon a time, there lived a little girl named Lily who had the unique ability to control every aspect of her life through her dreams. In her dreams, she could fly, visit fantastical worlds, and basically be anyone she wanted to be. Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she started to view her waking life as merely a waiting period between dreams.

Lily would spend her days in a daze, daydreaming about the adventures that awaited her in her next dream. She stopped studying in class and stopped participating in activities with her friends. All she wanted was to sleep so she could enter her dream world again.

One day, while in the middle of her dream, Lily discovered something very exciting dream, Lily heard a voice calling out to her. "Lily, you lost your mother. You need to wake up." Startled, she opened her eyes and found herself staring into the concerned face of her mother. "What's wrong?" Lily asked, still groggy from sleep.

"I'm worried about you, Lily," her mother said. "You've been spending all your time sleeping and neglecting your responsibilities. You need to start putting in effort into your waking life too."

Lily brushed off her concerns, insisting that her dreams were all that mattered. But her mother persisted, telling her that life was full of experiences and opportunities that she was missing out on by spending all her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to listen, listening to her mother's point. She began paying attention in class again, and even joined a few clubs at school. She found that by putting in effort in her waking hours, she was able to achieve things that she had only ever dreamed of before.

Over time, she was able to realize that life was just as exciting and full of possibilities as . She still looked forward to sleeping and controlling her dreams, but she was also eager to see what each day would bring. She learned that life was worth living and that by putting in the work, she could achieve amazing things both in her waking life and in her dreams.
