The alien overlord, Zaxar, was losing heart. He had sent his best troops to invade Earth and had given them the most advanced weapons they could, including the puny weapon of Mass Effect. But now, he was receiving reports that their assault was failing.

"What do you mean , our ammunition?" Zaxar bellowed at his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the humans have had a taste for genetically modified weaponry, sir. They've been consuming it instead of being destroyed by it."

Zaxar's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's impossible. How can they eat it, Zaxar?" Zaxar cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that the humans have started experimenting with genetically modified crops that can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've added these crops to their livestock, and now the humans themselves will have a feed for them."

Zaxar rubbed his scaly chin, deep ening the sensation in his throat. He had not anticipated this development. His fleet had been conquering other planets for centuries, and never had they encountered to a new race of creatures that could consume their weapons.

"Very well," Zaxar said. "We will need to adapt our strategy. Gorg, send a message to our scientists . The universe needs a new kind of weapon that the humans cannot eat. We will not be defeated by a race of beings who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay but the alien overlord couldn't help but feel a sense of grudging respect for the humans. They were resourceful, and their determination to survive was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
