Jenna had always been fascinated by blacksmithing. As a child, she loved watching her father work the forge, hammering red-hot metal into intricate shapes. But when she expressed an interest in learning to work with metal herself, her father scoffed.

"Blacksmithing is not for women," he said. "It's a male job."

Jenna didn't believe him. She knew she had what it took to be a great blacksmith. So when she turned eighteen, she left home and headed to the nearest city, where she found work as an apprentice to a blacksmith. The work was hard, but Jenna loved it. She learned to heat and shape iron with the hammer and anvil, to make pieces of art from the raw materials. She also learned to work with flame, using it to heat the metal to just the right temperature before shaping it with her hammer.

Over the years, Jenna honed her skills, becoming one of the best blacksmiths in the area. People came from all around to Jenna to create beautiful pieces for them. She crafted everything from simple hooks and hinges to elaborate swords and armor.

One day, a wealthy merchant approached Jenna with a special request. He wanted her to create a set of custom gates for his mansion, gates that would be both beautiful and strong enough to defend against unwanted guests.

Jenna accepted the request and set to work. For weeks, she toiled over the gates, heating the metal in the forge and shaping it with her hammer. She used every trick she had learned over the years, working the metal with precision and care.

When final, the gates were a beautiful black, they were strong , yet delicate and beautiful at the same time. The merchant was thrilled with them, but they compensated Jenna handsomely for her work.

As Jenna watched the gates open at the mansion, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. Through iron and flame, she had created something truly amazing. And she knew that she was doing her father wrong - blacksmithing wasn't just a man's job.
