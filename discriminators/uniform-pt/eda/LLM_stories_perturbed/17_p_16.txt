Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily who had the unique ability to control every aspect of her dreams. In her dreams, she could fly, visit fantastical lands, and be anyone she wanted to be. Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she started to view her waking life as merely a waiting period between dreams.

Lily would spend her days in a daze, daydreaming about the adventures that awaited her in her next dream. She stopped learning more questions in class and stopped participating in activities with her friends. All she wanted was to sleep so she could enter her dream world again.

One night, she awoke in the middle of a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice call out to her. "Lily, wake up! You need to hear this!" Startled, she opened her eyes and found herself staring into the face of her mother.

"What's wrong?" Lily asked, still groggy from sleep.

"I'm worried about you, Lily," her mother said. "You've been spending all your time sleeping and neglecting your responsibilities. You need to start putting effort into your dreams too."

Lily brushed off her mother's concerns, thinking her dreams were all that mattered. But her mother persisted, telling her that life was full of experiences and opportunities that she was missing out on due to spending all her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to see her mother's point. She started paying attention in class again, and even joined a few clubs at school. She found that by putting in effort in her waking life, she was able to do things she had only ever dreamed of before.

Over time, Lily began to realize that life was just as exciting and full of possibilities as her dreams. She still looked forward to controlling her waking life and controlling her dreams, but now she was starting to prepare for the dayâ€™s events as they happened to see what each day would bring. She learned that life was about effort and that by putting in the work, she could achieve amazing things both in her waking life and in her dreams.
