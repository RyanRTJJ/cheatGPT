As I walked through the dark , narrow alleys of the city, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and my heart raced with every step. It was then that I saw it - a rip in time, hovering in front of me like a portal to another world.

Without a second thought, I stepped through the rip and found myself on a cold, metal table. My head spun as I tried to make sense of my surroundings. The room was dimly lit and extremely sterile, with surgical instruments neatly arranged on a table next to me.

As I tried to move, I realized that my arms and legs were stuck. Panic set in as I struggled against the stiffness and weight as they held fast. That's when I heard the footsteps approaching.

A figure dressed in black tie entered the room, their face obscured by a surgical mask. They picked up one of the instruments and approached me, their movements precise and deliberate. My heart pounded in my chest as they began to make incisions, cutting through flesh and flesh with skillful precision.

I screamed out in agony as they worked, but the nurse was stoic and focused. Minutes passed, and I found myself growing weaker by the second. Just as I thought it was the end, the figure stopped and stepped away, leaving me bleeding and alone on the table.

I lay there, gasping for breath, unsure of what had happened. It was only when I managed to wrench myself free of the restraints that I realized the truth - I had been transported to a future where medical science had advanced to amazing new heights.

But at what cost? As I walked out of the room and into the bright, sterile light of the future, I couldn't shake the feeling life had been violated in ways that went beyond physical pain. The rip in time that had brought me there had torn a hole in my very soul, and I knew that I was never going to truly return to the life I had known before.
