Dr. Samantha Lee had been preparing for this moment for years. She had undergone extensive vetting procedures, had poured over countless research papers, and had spent countless hours practicing new scenarios, all in preparation for the day when our aliens made contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life.

And now that day had finally arrived.

Samantha sat nervously at her console, her excitement heightened as she watched the signal coming from the alien transmission. Her team had been expecting some kind of response, but they were all surprised when the signal turned out to be a complex, multi-layered message, one that they couldn't quite decipher.

But Samantha was determined to try again and see if they could make sense of it. She began running the message through a series of filters and algorithms, trying to isolate the individual components of the message.

For hours, she worked tirelessly, consumed by the task at hand and barely noticed when her colleagues left for the evening, leaving energy to her alone in the lab.

It was when she finally made a breakthrough that things began to go off course. Once she deciphered the message, Samantha realized that the aliens were trying to warn humanity about a massive asteroid that was coming close to the surface of the Earth. The asteroid threat was so large that it would wipe out all life on the planet, and the aliens were offering their help to those who needed it.

But instead of following protocol and reporting her findings to her superiors, Samantha made a split-second decision. She knew that the leaders of her country would never agree to work with an alien race, no matter how dire the situation... so, without a second thought, she sent a message back to the aliens, accepting their offer of payment. The next day, when Samantha's colleagues returned to the lab, they found her slumped over her console, the alien transmission of the messages on a loop in the background. They tried to revive her, but it was too late. Samantha had been hit by a massive stroke, brought on by the stress and exhaustion of her work.

But her legacy would live on. The aliens did indeed come to Earth's aid, deflecting the asteroid that had threatened to hit and saving humanity from certain doom. And while Dorothy's decision to go off-script may have cost her her life, it also saved the lives of countless others.
