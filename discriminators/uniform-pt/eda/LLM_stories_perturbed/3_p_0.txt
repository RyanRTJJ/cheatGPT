For as long as he could remember, Tyler had always had the same recurring dream. In it, he would find himself wandering through a fantastical world filled with strange creatures and towering castles. And every time, he would always be approached by a strange girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She never introduced herself, but over time, they became close friends, exploring the world together and sharing secrets and stories.

As Tyler grew older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got a job, and started building a life for himself, an experience he never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and sometimes he would catch himself daydreaming about her.

One day, as he walked through the park, Tyler saw her. The girl from his dreams was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he must be imagining things, but as he got closer, he could see that it was really her. She looked older, of course, but the sparkling , vibrant, mischievous little woman was still there.

Tyler walked up to her and said hello, but she just looked at him with a blank stare as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding her of her time in the dream world, but she shook her head and said she had to go.

For weeks, Tyler tried to find her, but she seemed to be avoiding him. Finally, one day, he managed to catch her alone. He asked her why she was acting so strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him with sad eyes and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I can't explain it . It's too complicated."

Tyler tried asking her for more information, but she refused to say anything else. As everyone stared away, he couldn't help feeling a sense of loss. The girl from the movie had been real all along, but now she seemed to be hiding from him once again.

For months, Tyler tried to forget about her, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something important he was missing. Then, one night, he had a flash and before he knew it, he was back in the fantastical world, and there she was, the girl from his fairy tale that was waiting for him.

As they explored the dream world once again, she revealed everything to him. She was a traveler between worlds, a guide who helped people navigate the complexities of the multiverse. He had been one of her charges, someone she had been tasked with guiding through his dreams. But now that he was no longer a dreamscape, it was time for her to move on to other students. He ended up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had finally gotten the answers he had cherished, but he knew he would never see her again. As he went about his days he couldn't help but feel grateful for the time he and his bride had shared together, both in his dreams and in the brief moments of reality.
