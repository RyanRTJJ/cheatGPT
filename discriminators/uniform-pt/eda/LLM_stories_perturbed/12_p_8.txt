As the head of NASA, I've always known that the Earth is flat. But that's a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few within the government and scientific community.

So when the President asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept it a secret is because it would cause mass panic and chaos if the public could learn the truth," I explained.

"But why would that happen?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would completely undermine our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics," I said. "It would also raise s a lot of questions about our place in this world and our purpose as a species."

The President nodded thoughtfully. "I see your point," he said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know the truth?"

I sighed. "Yes, of course they do. But we need to be careful where we reveal this information. We need to make sure that we understand the implications of what it means for the world."

The President nodded again, and I could tell he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with me," he said.

As he left , I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for so long, but I knew that we were doing the right thing in keeping the truth hidden for now. Perhaps one day, when humanity has stopped destroying the Earth, we can reveal ourselves to the world and begin to unravel the mysteries of our flat Earth.
