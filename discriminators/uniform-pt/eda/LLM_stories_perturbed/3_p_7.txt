For as long as he could remember, Tyler had always had the same recurring dream. In it, he would find himself wandering through a fantastical world filled with terrifying creatures and towering castles. A lot of the time, Tyler would dream he would be joined by a strange girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She never introduced herself, but over time, they became close friends, entering her dream world together and sharing secrets and thoughts. As he grew older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got a job, and started building a life for himself. But he never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and sometimes he would catch himself daydreaming about her.

One day, walking through the park, Tyler saw her. The girl from his dreams. She was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he was imagining things, but as he got closer, he could see that it was really her. She looked different, of course, but the sparkling eyes and mischievous smile were still there.

Tyler walked up to her and said hello, but she just looked at him with a blank expression, like she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding her of their adventures in the dream world, but she shook her head and said she had to go.

For weeks, Tyler tried to find her again, but she seemed to never trust him. Finally, on one of his last days alone, he managed to catch her alone. He asked her why she was acting so strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him with a dumb smile and a look of confusion and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I can't explain it right now. It's too complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more information, but she refused to say anything else. As she walked away, he couldn't help feeling a sense of loss. The woman of his dreams had been real all along, but she seemed to be slipping away from him once again.

For months, Tyler tried to forget about her, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something important he was missing. Then, one night, he had a dream. In it, he was back in the fantastical world, and there she was, the girl from his dreams, waiting for him.

As he entered the dream world once again, she finally explained everything to him. She was a traveler between worlds, a guide who helped people navigate the complexities of the multiverse. Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she had been tasked with guiding for several years due to his dreams. But now that he was an adult, it was time for her to move on to other responsibilities.

Tyler woke up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had found the answers he had been seeking, but he knew he would never meet her again. As he went about his day, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the time they had shared together, both in his dreams and in the brief moments they had spent in reality.
