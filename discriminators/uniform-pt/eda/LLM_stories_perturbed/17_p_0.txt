Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who had the unique ability to control nearly every aspect of her dreams. In her dreams, she could fly, visit fantastical lands, and be anyone she wanted to be. Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she started to view her waking life as merely a waiting period between dreams.

Lily would spend her days in a daze, daydreaming about the adventures that awaited her in her next dream. She stopped paying attention in class and stopped participating in social activities with her friends. All she wanted was to wake up so she could experience the dream world again.

One day, while in the middle of a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice calling out to her. "Lily, wake up! You need to see your mother!" Startled, Lily opened her eyes and saw herself on the concerned face of her mother.

"What's wrong?" Lily asked, still groggy from sleep.

"I'm worried about you, Lily," her mother said. "You've been spending all your time sleeping and neglecting your responsibilities. You need to start putting in effort into your waking life too."

Lily brushed off her mother's concerns, insisting that her dreams were all that mattered. But her mother persisted, telling her that their world was full of experiences and that she was missing out on them by spending all her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to see her mother's point. She started paying closer attention to her class work and even joined a few clubs at school. She found that by putting in effort in her school and social life, she was able to achieve things that she had only ever dreamed of before.

Over time, Lily began to realize that life was just as exciting and full of possibilities as her dreams. She still looked forward to sleeping and controlling her dreams, but now she was also eager to see what each day would bring. She learned that her dreams were worth her effort and that by putting in the work, she could achieve amazing things both in her personal life and in her dreams.
