It was a beautiful summer day, so I decided to take my kids to the park. They were ecstatic and couldn't wait to start playing on the swings and slides. As we arrived, I noticed some dark clouds looming in the distance, but I thought there would be plenty of time to enjoy the park before the rain hit.

As my kids were playing, I started to notice the sound of a lightning strike. The hair on my arms began to stand up, and the air felt electrically charged. I immediately knew we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my kids and ran towards the nearest shelter. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning struck nearby, and I felt an excruciating pain coursing through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my kids crying and calling my name.

It took me a few moments to realize what had happened. I had been hit by lightning. As I got up, I noticed something strange. My senses were heightened, and I could sense everything around me with increased accuracy. It was like an extra sense had been activated within me.

As I walked with my mom back to our car, I can honestly say my Dad Senses had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate every move my everything about me, and I could sense danger before it happened. It was unbelievableâ€”I had become a super protective father with the power to protect my kids from harm.

From that day on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had always been a protective father, but now I could take it to the next level. I could sense danger before it happened, and I could hear if anyone else even knew what was going on.

As we got into the car, my kids looked up at me with concern. But I smiled at them and said, "Don't ever worry. I've got this. With my Dad Senses, we'll always be safe."
