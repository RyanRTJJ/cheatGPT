The alien overlord, Zaxar, felt sick. He had sent his best troops to the planet and had given them the most advanced weapons to destroy the puny humans. But now, he was receiving reports that their ammunition was failing.

"What do you mean they failed to take ammunition?" Zaxar bellowed at his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the humans have developed a taste for our weaponry, sir. They've been consuming it instead of being destroyed ." Zaxar's eyes widened in disbelief. "... How can they eat our weapons?"

Gorg cleared his throat. "It appears that the humans have been experimenting with genetically modified crops that can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been feeding these crops to their livestock, and now they themselves have developed a special ability to digest them."

Zaxar rubbed his scaly chin, deep in thought. He had not anticipated this development. His empire had been conquering other planets for centuries, and this was the second planet they encountered a species that could destroy their own weapons.

"Very well," Zaxar finally said. "We will need to adapt our species to defeat their weapons. We cannot send a message to our scientists to develop a new kind of weapon that we cannot eat. We will not be defeated by a race of humans who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's orders, the alien s could not help but feel a sense of respect for the humans. They were resourceful, and their determination to survive was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
