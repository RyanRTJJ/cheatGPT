For as long as he could remember, Tyler had always had the same recurring dream. In each one, he would be wandering through a fantastical world filled with strange creatures and towering castles. And every time, he would be joined by a strange girl with blue eyes and a mischievous smile. She never introduced herself, but over time, they became close friends, exploring the dream world together and sharing secrets and stories.

As Tyler grew older, the dreams began to be eclipsed by the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got a job, and started building a life for himself. But he never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and sometimes would catch himself looking for her.

One day, while walking through the park, Tyler saw her. The girl from his dreams. She was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he must be imagining things, but as he got closer, he could see that it was really her. She looked older, more mature, but the sparkling eyes and mischievous smile were still there. He went up to her and said hello, but she just looked at him with a blank expression, as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding her of her adventures in the dream world, but she just shook her head and retreated, knowing she had to go.

For weeks, Tyler tried to find her , but she seemed to be avoiding him. Finally, one day, he managed to catch her alone. He asked her why she was acting so strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him with sad eyes and said, "I remember him. But I can't explain it right now. It's complicated." He pressed her for more information, but she refused to say anything else. As she walked away, he couldn't help feeling a sense of loss. The girl from his dreams had been real all along, but now she seemed to be slipping away , one by one once again.

For months, Tyler tried to forget about her, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something important he was neglecting. And suddenly, she wasn't the one night, he had a dream. In the dream, he was back in the fantastical world, and there she was, the girl from his dreams, waiting for him.

As they explored the dream world once again, she became everything to him. She was a traveler between worlds, a guide who helped people navigate the complexities of the multiverse. Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she had been tasked with guiding through his dreams. But now that he was waking up, it was time for her to move on to other things. Tyler woke up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had finally got the answers he had been seeking, but he knew he would never see her again, and as he went about his day, he couldn't help but feel a profound gratitude for the time they had shared together, both in his dreams and in the brief moments of reality.
