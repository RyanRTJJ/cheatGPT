Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily who had the unique ability to control every moment of her lifeâ€”except her dreams. In her dreams, she could fly, visit fantastical lands, and be anyone she wanted to be in her dreams. Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she started to view her waking life as merely a waiting period between dreams.

Lily spent her days in a daze, daydreaming about the adventures that awaited her in her dream. She stopped paying attention in class and stopped participating in activities with her friends. All she wanted was to be sure that she had an opportunity to spend the rest of her days travelling on her dream world again.

One day, while in the middle of a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice calling out to her. "Lily, wake up! You need to hear this!" Startled, she opened her eyes and found herself staring into the concerned face of her mother.

"What's wrong?" she asked, still groggy from sleep.

"I'm worried about you, Lily," her mother said. "You've been spending all your energy on yourself and not living up to your responsibilities. You need to be putting in effort into your waking life too."

Lily brushed off her mother's warning, insisting that her dreams were all that mattered. But her mother persisted, telling her that life was full of adventure and there was so much she was missing out on by spending all her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to see her mother's point. She started paying attention in class again, and even joined up with clubs at school. She found that by putting in effort in her waking life, she was able to find the satisfaction in her dreams that she had only ever dreamed of before.

Over time, Lily began to realize that life was just as exciting and full of possibilities as her dreams. She still looked forward to sleeping and controlling her dreams, but now she was also eager to see what the day would bring. She finally felt that life was worth her effort and that by putting in the efforts she could achieve good things both in her waking life and in her dreams.
