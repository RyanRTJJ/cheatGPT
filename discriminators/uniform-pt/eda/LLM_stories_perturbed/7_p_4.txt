It was a beautiful summer day, and I decided to take our girls to the park. They were ecstatic and eager to start playing on the swings and slides. As we arrived, I noticed some dark clouds looming in the sky over the lake, but I thought we had plenty of time to enjoy the park before the rain hit.

As my kids were playing, I started to notice the signs of a lightning strike. The hair on my arms began to stand up, which was not an uncommon reaction. Even the air felt electrically charged. I immediately knew we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my kids and ran towards the nearest shelter. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning struck nearby, and I felt an excruciating pain somewhere in my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the couch, my kids crying and calling out my name.

It took me a few moments to remember what had happened. I had been struck by lightning. As I got up, I noticed something strange. My senses were completely magnified. I could sense everything around me with incredible accuracy. It was like a sixth sense had been activated within me.

As I walked with my kids back to the car, I realized my Dad Senses had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate every move my kids were about to make, and I could sense danger before it happened. It was like I had become a superhero, with the power to save my kids from harm.

From that moment on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had always been a protective parent, but now I could take it to the next level. I could sense danger before it happened, and I could react before anyone else could see what was happening. As we walked down the road near the car, my kids looked up at me with concern. But I smiled at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's in control. With my Dad Senses, we'll always be safe."
