You woke up about a mile away, your heart racing as you sat up in the only seat on the plane. The last thing you remembered was glancing at your watch and seeing the time was 10:34 am, when a deafening explosion had rocked the plane, sending debris flying everywhere. You had braced yourself for impact, but you were still alive and seemingly unharmed.

Confused, you looked around at your fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be sleeping peacefully or enjoying their in-flight entertainment. You glanced out the window and saw nothing but blue sky and fluffy white clouds. It was as if the explosion had never happened.

You reached for your watch and checked the time. To your surprise, it was 4 am. Had you been dreaming? It all felt so real.

As you tried to make sense of what had just occurred, the captain's voice came over the radio. "Ladies and gentlemen, we anticipate the slight turbulence. Please remain seated with your seatbelt fastened until the plane has safely passed through this patch of rough air."

Turbulence? You looked around and thought that no one else seemed to have noticed anything unusual. But the hum of the plane's engine did seem to have changed slightly, as if it was struggling to maintain altitude.

You felt a chill run down your spine as you realized that something was not right. You glanced out the window again and saw that the sky had changed colour, as if it was nighttime. It was only then that there was another loud noise, this time from the engine. It just seemed like a loud bang, followed by a hissing sound. People around you started to panic and scream ed as the plane began to lose altitude rapidly.

You scrambled to fasten your seat belt s and brace yourself for impact. This time, you knew it would be different. Before the plane crashed into the ocean, you felt a sharp pain in your back and everything went black. When you looked up again, you were floating in space, surrounded by debris from the plane. You realized that you were lucky to be alive, but the memories of the strange time jump and the explosion haunted you for the rest of your life.
