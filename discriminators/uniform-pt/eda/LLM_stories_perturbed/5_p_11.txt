Jenna had always been fascinated by blacksmithing. As a child, she loved watching her father work the forge, hammering red-hot metal into beautiful, intricate pieces. But when she expressed an interest in mastering the trade herself, he had scoffed.

"Blacksmithing is not your job," he said. "It's a man's job."

Jenna didn't mind the insult. She knew she had what it took to becoming a great blacksmith. And so, when she turned eighteen, she left home and traveled to the nearest city, where she found an opportunity to work as an apprentice to a master blacksmith.

The work was hard, but Jenna loved it. She learned to heat up and make iron with the hammer and anvil, to create beautiful pieces of art from nothing but raw materials. She also learned to work with flame, using it to heat the metal to just the right temperature before breaking it with with her hammer.

Over the years, Jenna has learned much more skills, becoming one of the most popular metalsmiths in the city. People came from all around to commission her to create beautiful pieces for them. She crafted everything from simple hooks and hinges to gates, gateposts, and armor.

One day, a handsome gentleman approached Jenna with a special request. He wanted her to create a set of custom iron gates for his mansion, gates that would be both beautiful and strong enough to keep out unwanted guests.

Jenna accepted the challenge, and set to work creating them! Within weeks, she toiled over the gates, heating the metal in the forge and shaping it in her hands. She used the techniques she had learned over the years, working the metal with precision and care.

When she finished, the gates were a masterpiece. They were strong and sturdy, yet delicate and charming at the same time. The merchant was thrilled with them, and paid Jenna handsomely for her work.

As Jenna watched the gates being installed at the mansion, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. Through blacksmithing and flame, she had created something amazing. And she knew that she had proved her father right: blacksmithing was not just a man's job.
