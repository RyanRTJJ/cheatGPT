As the head of NASA, I've always known that the Earth is flat. It's a well-guarded secret, known only to a small, select few within the government and scientific community. When the incoming President asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the American people, I had to think fast about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this in secret is because it would cause mass panic and chaos if the public were to learn the truth," I explained.

"But why would that be?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for us, it would completely undermine our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics," I said. "It would also raise a lot of questions about our place in the world and our purpose as a species."

The President nodded thoughtfully. "I see your point," he said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know ?" The President sighed. "Yes, of course they do. But we need to be sure we get that wrong about how we reveal . We need to make sure people understand the implications of what it means for our world."

The manager faced me again, and I could tell he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with me," he said.

As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for so long, but I knew that we were doing the right thing by keeping the truth hidden . Perhaps one day, when humanity is ready, we can face this truth and begin to explore the vast beauty of our flat Earth.
