The alien overlord, Zaxar, was furious. He had sent his best troops to invade Earth and given them the best weapons to destroy the puny humans. But now, he was receiving reports that their assault ers had eaten their ammunition. "That, do you mean they ate our ammunition?" Zaxar bellowed at his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the Federation may have developed a taste for our weaponry, sir. They've been consuming it instead of being able to reproduce it."

Zaxar's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's impossible. How can they even appreciate our weapons?"

Gorg cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that the Federation has been experimenting with genetically modified crops that can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been feeding these crops to their livestock, and now the humans themselves have developed a taste for them."

Zaxar was scaly -eyed and lost in thought. He had not anticipated this development. His fleet had been conquering other planets , and never had they encountered a species that could destroy the human people and their weapons.

"Very well," Zaxar finally said. "We will need to adapt our strategy. Gorg, send a message to our scientists to develop the kind of weapons the humans cannot eat. We will not be defeated by a race of beings who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's orders, the alien overlord couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for the humans. They were resourceful, and their determination to survive was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to defend it no matter what it took.
