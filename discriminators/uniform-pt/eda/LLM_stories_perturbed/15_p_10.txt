The alien overlord, Tara, was furious. He had sent his best troops to invade Earth and had given them the most advanced weapons to destroy the puny humans. But now, he was hearing reports that their assault was failing.

"What do you mean we lost all our ammunition?" Tara asked at his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the humans have had quite a taste for our weaponry, sir. They've been consuming it instead of being destroyed by it." Zaxar's eyes widened in recognition. "This is impossible. How can they eat our weapons?" He cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that the humans have been experimenting with genetically modified crops that can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been feeding these crops to their livestock, and now the humans themselves have a taste for them. He rubbed his scaly chin, deep in thought. He had not anticipated this development. His fleet had been conquering other planets for centuries, and never had they encountered a species that could consume their weapons.

"Very well," Zaxar finally said. "We will need to adapt our strategy. Gorg, send a message to our scientists to develop a species of weapons that the humans cannot use. We will not be destroyed by a race of beings who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's orders, his alien overlord couldn't help but feel a healthy, grudging respect for the humans. They were resourceful, and their determination to survive demonstrated how smart of them they truly were. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
