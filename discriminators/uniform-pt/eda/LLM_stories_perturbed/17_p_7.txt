Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who had the unique ability to control every aspect of her dreams. In her dreams, she could fly, explore distant lands, and become whatever she wanted to be. Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she started to view her waking life as merely a waiting period between dreams.

Lily would spend her days in a daze, daydreaming about the future that awaited her in her next dream. She stopped paying attention to class and never got very interested in activities with her friends. All she wanted was to sleep so she could enter the world again.

One day, while in the middle of a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice calling out to her. "Lily, wake up! You need to hear this!" Lily opened her eyes and found herself staring at the concerned face of her mother.

"What's wrong?" Lily asked, still groggy from her dream. "Don't worry about it," her mother said. "You've been spending all your time sleeping and neglecting your responsibilities. You need to start putting that effort out there into your waking life too."

Lily brushed off her mother's concerns, insisting that her dreams were all that mattered. For a while though, her mother persisted, telling her that life was full of wonderful opportunities that she was missing out on by spending so much time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to see her She started to feel more like herself again. She started paying attention in class again, and even joined a few clubs at school. She found that by putting in effort in her waking life, she was able to achieve things that she had only dreamed of before.

Over time, Lily began to realize that life was just as exciting and full of possibilities as her dreams. She still looked forward to sleeping and controlling her dreams, but now she was also eager to see what each day would bring. She learned that life was worth living, and that with enough commitment to put in the work, she could achieve amazing things both in her life and in her dreams.
