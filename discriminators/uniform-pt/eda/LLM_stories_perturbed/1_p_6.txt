The night sky was illuminated by the soft glow of the full moon. It was a beautiful sight, but little did anyone know that something special was about to happen.

As the clock struck midnight, the moon began to tremble and crack. The ten percent of the people on Earth watched in awe as the giant egg that was the moon finally began to hatch.

At first, there was only a tiny crack, but it grew wider and wider until the egg finally split in half. Finally, a bright light emanated from the empty space, blinding anyone who dared to look directly at it.

Then, from the egg emerged a creature unlike anything anyone had ever seen before. It had iridescent scales that shimmered in the moonlight, and bat-like wings that it used to stretch out and gnaw at the remaining bits of eggshell.

The creature let out a piercing cry that echoed throughout the night sky, and everyone on Earth held their breath in anticipation. What would happen next?

Slowly but surely, the creature began to ascend into the sky, soaring higher and higher . Finally, the giant creature was nothing more than a small dot in the distance. And as it disappeared into the darkness, the people of Earth were left to wonder what other secrets the great giant could hold.

For years to come, people would stare up at the moon with a newfound sense of wonder and excitement, knowing that there was more to the world than they ever could have imagined. And as they gazed up at the moon, they couldn't help but wonder what other secrets the universe might hold.
