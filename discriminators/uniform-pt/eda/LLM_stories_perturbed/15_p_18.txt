The alien overlord, Zaxar, was angry. He had sent his best troops to invade Earth and had given them the most advanced weapons to destroy the humans. But now, he was receiving reports that their assault s had failed. "What do you mean they ate our ammunition?" Zaxar bellowed at his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the humans have developed a taste for our weaponry, sir. They've been consuming it instead of being destroyed by it."

Zaxar's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's impossible. How can anyone eat such a weaponry?" He cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that the humans have been experimenting with biologically modified crops that can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been feeding these crop plants to their livestock, and now the humans themselves have developed a taste for them, too. Riker rubbed his scaly skin in thought. He had not anticipated this development. His fleet had been conquering other planets for centuries, and never had they encountered a species that could consume metal, as well," Zaxar finally said. "We will need to adapt our strategy. Gorg, send a message to our scientists to develop a new kind of weapon that the aliens cannot eat. We will not be defeated by any kind of beings who consume metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's orders, the alien overlord couldn't help but feel a sense of grudging respect for the humans. They were brave, and their determination to survive was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he wanted Earth to emerge intact no matter what it took.
