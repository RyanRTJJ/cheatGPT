John had always been fascinated with the idea of immortality. He had spent years researching and experimenting in his basement laboratory, and finally, he had it. He had discovered the secret to immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the great new things he could accomplish now that he had all the time in the world. But suddenly, Death appeared before him, handing John a business card with a message. "When you realize living forever sucks, call me from New York. I've got a job offer for you."

John was confused but intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death would offer him a job, but he decided to keep the card and continue with his newfound immortality.

At first, John was thrilled with his newfound freedom. He traveled the world, learned new skills, and made a fortune. But as time went on, John realized that living forever wasn't as easy as he had thought it would be.

He slowly lost a bit of his independence as his loved ones aged and passed away, leaving him alone in a world that was constantly changing. He saw wars and disasters that he could do nothing about. He felt like a prisoner in His own body, unable to escape the monotony of endless days.

It was then that John remembered the business card that the man had given him. He decided to call the number, curious to see what kind of job offer Death could have for an acquaintance. "Looks like a surprise, Death answered the phone, his voice calm and reserved. "I knew you would call eventually," he said. "I have a job offer for you, John. I need someone to help me manage the afterlife, someone who understands what it's like to him, John couldn't believe what he was hearing. But as Death explained the details of his death, John realized that this was exactly what he had been looking for. He could finally use his immortality to help others, to guide them through life and ensure that they found peace.

And so, John took him to the side of the job offer that marked a new chapter of his endless life. He no longer felt trapped in his immortality but instead embraced it as a tool to help others find their way. And though he still missed his mortal friends and family, he knew that he was where he was meant to be.
