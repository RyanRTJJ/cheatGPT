You woke up at a cracking start, your heart racing as you crouched in your seat on the plane. The last thing you remembered was checking your watch and noticing the time was 10:34 am, just before a deafening explosion had rocked the plane, sending debris flying everywhere. You had braced yourself for impact, but now you were still alive , unharmed.

Confused, you looked around at your fellow passengers, all of whom appeared to be sleeping peacefully or engrossed in their in-flight entertainment. You glanced out the window . Nothing seemed to happen, nothing but blue sky and fluffy white clouds. It was as if the plane had never happened.

You reached for your watch and checked the time. To your surprise, it was 9:35 am. Had you been dreaming? It was so real.

As you tried to make sense of what had just happened, the captain's voice came over the intercom. "Ladies and gentlemen, we have been experiencing the slight turbulence. Please remain seated with our seat belts fastened until we have safely passed through this period of rough air."

Turbulence? You turned around and saw that no one else seemed to have noticed anything unusual. But the hum of the plane's engine did seem to have changed slightly, as if it was struggling to maintain altitude.

You felt a chill run down your spine as you realized that something was not right. You glanced out the window again , noting that the sky had turned dark, as if it was nighttime. But it was only 9:35 pm. There was another loud noise, this time from the engine. It sounded like a loud bang, followed by an explosive sound. People around you started to panic and scream as the plane began to crash rapidly.

You scrambled to fasten your seat belt and braced yourself for a loud crash. For the first time, you knew it was real.

As the plane crashed into the ocean, you felt a sharp pain in your head and everything went black. When you woke up again, you were floating in the water, surrounded by debris from the plane. You realized that you were lucky to be alive, but the memory of the strange time in the plane would haunt you for the rest of your life.
