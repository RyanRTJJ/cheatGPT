It was hot summer day, and I decided to take my kids to the park in my own neighborhood. They were ecstatic and couldn't wait to start playing on the swings and slides. As I arrived, I noticed some dark clouds looming in the distance, but I thought we had plenty of time to enjoy the park before the rain hit.

As we were playing, I started to feel the telltale signs of a lightning strike. The hair on my arms began to stand up, and the air felt electrically charged. I immediately knew we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my kids and ran towards the nearest shelter. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning struck nearby, and I felt a blast of pain coursing through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my kids crying and calling out my name.

It took me a few moments to realize what had happened. I had been hit by lightning. As I got to the park I noticed something strange. My senses were heightened, and I could sense everything around me with incredible accuracy. It was like a sixth sense had been activated within me.

As I walked with my kids back to our car, I realized that my awareness had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate every move my kids were about to make, and I could sense danger before anything happened. It was like I had become a superhero, with the power to protect my kids from harm.

From that day on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had been a great role model and been a wonderful father, but now , I take it to the day, and I could sense danger before it came. And I could react before anyone else even knew what was going on.

As we got in the car, my mother and daughter looked up at me with concern. But I smiled at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's got this. With my Dad Senses, we'll always be safe."
