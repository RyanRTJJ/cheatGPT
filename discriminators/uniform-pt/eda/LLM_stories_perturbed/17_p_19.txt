Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who had the ability to control every aspect of life through her dreams. In her dreams, she could fly, visit fantastical lands, and be anyone she wanted to be. Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she started to view her waking life as merely a waiting period between dreams.

Lily would spend her days in between, daydreaming about the adventures that awaited her in her next dream. She stopped attending classes, stopped taking classes in class and stopped participating in activities with her friends. All she wanted was to sleep so she could enter her dream world again.

One day, while Lily was in the middle of a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice call out to her. "Lily, wake up! You can hear this!" Startled, Lily opened her eyes and found herself staring into the concerned face of her mother.

"What's wrong?" Lily asked, still groggy from sleep.

"I'm worried about you," her mother said. "You've been spending all your time sleeping and neglecting your responsibilities. You need to be putting in effort into our life too."

Lily brushed off her mother's concerns, insisting that her dreams were all that mattered. But her mother persisted, reminding her that life was full of wonderful people and opportunities that she was missing out on by spending all her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to see her mother's point. She started paying attention in class and even joined a few clubs at school. She found that by putting in effort in her waking life, she was able to achieve things that she had only ever dreamed of before.

Over time, Lily came to realize that life was just as fun and full of possibilities as her dreams. She still looked forward to learning more about the power of magic and controlling her dreams, but now she was also eager to see what dreams each day would bring. She learned that life valued her effort and that by putting in the work, she could do great things both in her waking life and in her dreams.
