As a child, she felt out of place. She struggled to make friends and often found herself reading books about the supernatural. It wasn't until her teenage years that she discovered her true nature as a witch, and suddenly everything made sense.

But being a witch wasn't easy. Her family didn't accept her, and she was often always bullied. So when Sarah stumbled upon a spell that promised to give her the power to make anyone love her, she couldn't resist.

The spell worked, but it came with a dark cost. Sarah found out that the love she received was not genuine, but forced. She became a puppet master, pulling the strings of people's hearts to suit their desires.

For years, Sarah used her power to manipulate those around her, always thirsting for more. But as time went on, she began to feel a deep emptiness within her. She realized that true love and acceptance could never be forced, only earned.

Desperate to break into this world, Sarah shed the fake smile she had put on herself, Sarah searched for a way to undo her magic. And that's when she discovered the secret power that promised to lift her from despair - but only through the sacrifice of an innocent life.

Sarah struggled with this decision for weeks, but eventually her natural desire for redemption won out. And so, she lured an unsuspecting victim to her home and performed the ritual, watching in horror as the life drained from the innocent person before her.

As the illusion was lifted and Sarah's power was enraged, she was left with a newfound sense of guilt and shame. She had become the monster she had always feared, and there was no going back. The ritual brought out all of her regrets, Sarah knew that she had to face the consequences of her actions. And so, she turned herself in to the authorities, ready to face whatever punishment awaited her. For even in the depths of her depravity, she knew that she could never truly escape the horror of what she had done.
