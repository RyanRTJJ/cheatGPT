You awoke with a start, your heart racing as you sat up in your seat on the edge of the plane. The last thing you remember was glancing at your watch and seeing the time had reached 3 am, just before a deafening explosion had rocked the plane, sending debris flying everywhere. You had braced yourself for impact, but now you were still alive and seemingly unharmed.

Confused, you looked around at your fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be either occupied by their laptops or engrossed in the in-flight entertainment. You glanced out the window and saw nothing but blue sky and fluffy white clouds. It was as if the explosion had never happened.

You reached behind your watch and checked the time. To your surprise, it read 9:35 am. Had you been dreaming? It all felt strange. While you tried to make sense of what had just happened, the captain's voice came over the intercom. Lord Captain, ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the slight turbulence. Please remain seated with your seat belts fastened until we have safely passed through periods of rough air."

Turbulence? You looked around and saw that no one else seemed to have noticed anything unusual. But the hum of the plane's engine did seem to have changed slightly, as if it was struggling to maintain its airfoil position for a chill run down your spine as you realize that something is not right. You glanced out the window again and saw that the sky had turned black, as if it was nighttime. But it was only 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was another loud noise, this one came from the engine. It sounded like a loud bang, followed by a hissing sound. People around you started to panic and scream . The plane began to lose altitude rapidly.

You scrambled to your seat belt and braced yourself for impact. And suddenly you knew it was real.

As the plane crashed into the tarmac, you felt a sharp pain in your head and everything went black. When you woke up , you were floating in the water, surrounded by debris from the plane. You realized that you were lucky to be alive, but the memory of the strange time jump and the explosion haunted you for the rest of your life.
