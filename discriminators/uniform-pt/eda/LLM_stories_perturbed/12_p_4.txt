As a scientist and engineer at the headquarters of NASA, I've always known that the Earth is flat. It's a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few within the government and scientific community.

So when the President of the United States asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the American people, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this a secret is because it would cause mass panic in the world if the world were to learn the truth," I explained.

"But why would that be?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would undermine our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics," I said. "It would also raise a lot of questions about our place in the world and our purpose as a species."

The man watched me thoughtfully. "I see your point," he said. "But don't you think every person has a right to know the truth?"

I sighed. "Yes, of course they do. But we need to be careful about how we reveal this information. We need to make sure that people understand the implications of what it means for your future." The President nodded again, and I could tell he was deep in thought. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with me," he said.

As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel a true relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for so long, but I knew that we were doing the right thing by keeping the truth hidden for now. Perhaps one day, when humanity is ready, we can reveal the truth and begin to explore the mysteries of the Earth.
