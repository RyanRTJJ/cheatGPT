As a child, Sarah always felt out of place. She struggled to make friends and sought solace in books about the supernatural. It wasn't until her teenage years that she realised her true nature as a witch, and suddenly everything made sense.

But being a witch wasn't easy. Society didn't accept her, and her spirit was often ostracized and bullied. So when she first stumbled upon a spell that promised to give her the power to make anyone love her, she couldn't resist.

The spell worked, but it came with a dark cost. Sarah discovered that the power she received was anything but forced. She had become a puppet master, pulling the strings of people's hearts to suit her own desires.

For years, Sarah used her power to manipulate those around her, always thirsting for more. But as time went on, she began to feel a deep hurt within her. She realized that true love and acceptance could never be her only way to break the curse she had put on herself, Sarah searched for a way to undo her magic. And that's when she discovered the ancient ritual that promised to lift the curse, but only through the sacrifice of an innocent person. Sarah struggled with the decision for a while, but ultimately her desire for redemption won . And so, she lured an unsuspecting victim to her home and performed the ritual, watching in horror as the demon was removed from the innocent person before her.

As the curse was lifted and Sarah's power faded away, she became numb, filled with a sense of guilt and shame. She had become the monster she had always feared, and there was no going back.

But despite her regrets, she knew that she had to face the consequences of her actions. And so, she turned herself in to the authorities, ready to suffer whatever punishment awaited her. For even in the depths of her depravity, she knew that she could never truly escape the horror of what she had done.
