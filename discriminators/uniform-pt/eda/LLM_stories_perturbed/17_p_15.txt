Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily who had the unique ability to control every aspect of her dreams. In her dreams, she traveled to worlds of secret, could visit fantastical lands, or be anyone she wanted to be. Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she began to view her waking life as merely a waiting period between dreams.

Lily would spend her days in a daze, daydreaming about the adventures that would happen in her next dream. She stopped paying attention, starting class earlier, and even participating in activities with her friends. All she wanted was to sleep so she could enter her dream world again.

One day, Lily woke up in the middle of a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice calling out to her. "Lily, wake up! You need to hear this!" Startled, she opened her eyes and found herself staring into the concerned face of her mother, and turning around to see her. "How do I help?" Lily asked, still groggy from sleep.

"I'm worried about you, Lily," she said. "You're spending all your time sleeping and neglecting your responsibilities. You need to start putting in effort into your own life too."

Lily brushed off her mother's concerns, insisting that her dreams were all that mattered. But her mother persisted, telling her that life was full of experiences and opportunities that she had missed out on by spending all her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily came to see her mother's point. She started paying attention in class again, and joined a few clubs at school. She found that by putting in effort in her education, she was able to achieve things that she had only ever dreamed of before.

Over time, she began to realise that life was just as exciting and full of possibilities as her dreams. She still looked forward to sleeping and controlling her dreams, but now she was also eager to explore and find out what each day would bring. She knew that life was worth the effort and that by putting in the work, she could achieve amazing things , in her waking life and in her dreams.
