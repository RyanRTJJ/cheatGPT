It was a beautiful summer day, and I decided to take the kids to the park. They had not been in a while and couldn't wait to start playing on the water trampolines and slides. As we arrived, I noticed some dark clouds looming in the distance, but I thought we had plenty of time to enjoy the park before the rain hit.

As my kids were playing, I started to notice the signs of a lightning strike. The hair on my arms began to stand up, and the air felt electrically charged. I immediately knew we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my kids and ran towards the nearest open space. As soon as we finished looking, we reached the other way. But then, a bolt of lightning struck nearby, and I felt an excruciating pain coursing through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my kids crying and calling my name.

It took me a few moments to realize what had happened. I had been hit by lightning. As I got up, I noticed something. My senses had surged and I could sense everything around me with incredible accuracy. It was like a sixth sense had been activated within me.

As I walked with my kids back to our car, I realized that my Dad Senses had increased and I could anticipate every move my kids were starting to make, and I could find danger before it happened. It was like I had become a superhero, with the power to protect them from harm.

From that moment on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had always been a protective father, but now I could take it to the next level. I could sense danger before it happened, and I could react before anyone else even knew I was in danger. As we got off the car, my kids looked up at me with concern. But I smiled at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's got this. With my Dad Senses, we'll always be safe."
