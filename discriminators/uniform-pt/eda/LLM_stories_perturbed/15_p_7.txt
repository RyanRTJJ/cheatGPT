The alien overlord, Zaxar, was furious. He had sent his best troops to invade Earth and had given them the most advanced weapons to destroy the enemy. But now, he was receiving reports that their assault forces had eaten his ammunition. "What do you mean they ate our ammunition?" Zaxar snapped at his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the humans have developed a new approach to our genetically modified weaponry. They've been consuming it instead of being destroyed by it."

Zaxar's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's impossible. How can they eat our weapons?"

Gorg cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that the humans are only experimenting with genetically modified crops that can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been feeding these crops to their livestock, and now the humans themselves have developed a taste for them."

Zaxar rubbed his scaly chin, deep in thought. He had no idea what to make of this development. His fleet had been visiting planets for centuries, but no such matter what had they encountered a species that could consume their weapons.

"Very well," the CSG said. "We will have to adapt our strategy. Gorg, send a message to our scientists to develop a new kind of weapon that the humans cannot eat. We will not be defeated by a race of beings who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's orders, the ship's crew couldn't help but feel a sense of grudging respect for the humans. They were so fiercely determined and their determination to survive was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
