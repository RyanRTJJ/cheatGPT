It was a beautiful summer day, and I decided to take my kids to the park. They were ecstatic and couldn't wait get wet, and they had a blast playing on the water slides. As we arrived, I noticed some dark clouds looming off in the distance, but I thought we had plenty of time to enjoy the beauty of the rain hit.

As my kids were playing, I started to notice the telltale signs of a lightning strike. The hair on my arms began to stand up, and my whole body felt electrically charged because I immediately knew we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my kids and ran towards the nearest shelter. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning struck nearby, and I felt an unusual sensation coursing through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my cries accompanied by people crying and calling out my name.

It took me a few moments to realize what had happened. I had been struck by lightning. As I got up, I noticed something different. My senses were heightened, and I could sense everything around me with incredible accuracy. It was like a sixth sense had been activated within me.

As I walked with my kids back to our car, I realized Iâ€™d just noticed Mom and Dad Senses had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate every move my kids were about to make, and I could sense danger before it happened. It was as though I had become a superhero, with the power to protect my kids from harm.

From that day on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had always been a responsible father, but now I could take it to the next time. Today, however, it worked for me. I could sense danger before it happened, and I could react before anyone else even knew what was going on. When we got into the car, my kids looked up at me scared. But I smiled at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's got this. With my Dad Senses, we'll stay safe."
