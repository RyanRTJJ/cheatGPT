You woke up with a start, your heart racing as you sat up in your seat on the plane. The last thing you remembered was glancing at your watch and seeing the time was 10:34 am, when suddenly a deafening crack rocked the plane, sending debris flying everywhere. You had braced yourself for impact, but now you were still alive and seemingly unharmed.

Confused, you looked around at your fellow passengers, all of whom seemed to be sleeping or engrossed in some sort of in-flight entertainment. You glanced outside the window and saw nothing but a pink sky and fluffy white clouds. It was as if the explosion had never happened.

You reached for your watch and checked the time. To your surprise, it read three hours later! Had you been dreaming? It all was real.

As you tried to make sense of what had just happened, the captain's voice came over your phone: "Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the slight turbulence. Please remain upright and seated with your seat belts fastened until we have safely passed through this patch of rough air."

Turbulence? You looked around and noticed that no one else seemed to have noticed anything unusual. However, the hum of the plane's engine did seem to have changed and you wondered if it was changing to help maintain altitude.

You felt a chill run down your spine as you realized that something was not right. You looked out of the window again and saw that the sky had turned dark, as if it had gone totally dark. But it was only 9:35 am.

Suddenly, there was another loud noise, this time from the engine. It sounded like a loud bang, followed by a hissing sound. People around you started to panic and scream as the plane began to lose altitude rapidly.

You scrambled to fasten your seat belt and braced yourself for impact. This time, you knew it was real.

As the plane began to dip into the ocean, you felt a sharp pain in your head and everything went back into the room and when you woke up again, you were floating in the water, surrounded by debris from the plane. You realized that you were lucky to be alive, but the memory of the strange time jump and the trip home from the plane haunted you for the rest of your life.
