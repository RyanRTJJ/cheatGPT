As I walked through the dark and dingy alleys of the city, I couldn't put down the feeling that I was being watched. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and my heart raced with every step. It was true because I saw it - a rip in time, hovering in front of me like a portal to another world.

Without a second thought, I stepped through the rip and found myself on a cold, metal table. My head spun as I tried to make sense of my surroundings. The room was dimly lit and sterile, with the instruments neatly arranged on a table next to me.

As I tried to find it, I realized that my arms and legs were still unable to move. Panic set in as I struggled against the restraints, but they held fast. That's when I heard the footsteps approaching.

A figure dressed in white entered , their face obscured by a surgical mask. They picked up one of the instruments and approached me, their movements slow and deliberate. My heart pounded in my chest as they began to make incisions, cutting through the flesh with skillful precision.

I screamed out in agony as they worked, but the figure remained calm and focused. Minutes passed, and I feared we would never get through the evening, growing weaker by the second. Just as I thought it was all over, the figure just stepped away, leaving me bleeding and alone on the table.

I lay there, gasping , unsure of what had just happened. It was only when I managed to wrench myself free from the restraints that I realized the truth - I had been transported to a realm where medical science had advanced to unimaginable heights.

But at what cost? As I stumbled out of the room and into the sterile light of the hallway I couldn't shake the feeling that I had been violated in ways that had left me with psychological and physical pain. The rip in time that had brought me there created a hole in my heart, and I knew that I could never truly return to the life I had known before.
