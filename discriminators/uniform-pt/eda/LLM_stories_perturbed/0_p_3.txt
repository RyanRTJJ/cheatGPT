John had always been fascinated by the idea of immortality. He had spent years researching and experimenting in his basement laboratory, and finally, he had done it. He had known the secret to immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the new things he could accomplish now that he had all the time in the world. But suddenly, Death appeared at John, handing him a business card with a cryptic message: "When you realize living forever sucks, call this number. I've got a job offer for you."

John was confused but intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death would offer him a job, but John wanted to keep the card and play around with his newfound immortality.

At first, John was thrilled with his newfound longevity. He traveled the world, learned more and more about everything he could, and amassed a fortune. But as time went on, John realized that living forever wasn't as exciting as he had thought it would be.

He watched as his best ones aged and passed away, leaving him alone in a world that was constantly changing. He saw wars and disasters that he could do nothing to stop. He felt like a prisoner in his own body, unable to escape the monotony of the most recent days.

It was then he suddenly remembered the business card Death had given him. He decided to call the number to see what kind of job offer Death could have sent to an immortal man like himself.

To his surprise, Death answered the phone, looking calm and confident. "I knew you would call eventually," he said. "I have a job offer for you, John. I need someone to help me manage the afterlife, someone who understands what it's like to death, he couldn't believe what he was hearing. But as Death explained the details of the job, John realized that this was exactly what he had been looking for. He could finally use his magical power to help others, to guide them through the afterlife and ensure that they found peace.

And so, the ending of the job offer and began a new chapter of his endless life. He no longer felt trapped in his own mortal body but instead embraced it as a tool to help others find their way. And though he still missed his mortal friends and family, he knew this was where he was meant to be.
