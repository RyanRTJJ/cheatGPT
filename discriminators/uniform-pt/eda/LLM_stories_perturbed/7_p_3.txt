It was a beautiful summer day, and I decided to take my kids to the park. They were both thrilled with the park and couldn't wait to start playing on the swings and slides. As we arrived, I noticed some rain looming in the distance, but I thought we had plenty of time to enjoy the park before the rain hit.

As my kids were playing, I started to notice the telltale signs of a lightning strike. The hair on my neck began to stand up, and the air felt electrically charged. I immediately knew we needed to get out of there. So, without a secondâ€™s hesitation, I grabbed my kids and headed towards the nearest shelter. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning hit me inside the shelter, and I felt excruciating pain coursing through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my kids crying and calling out my name.

It took me a few moments to realize what had happened. I had been struck by lightning. As I got up, I noticed something strange. My senses were heightened, and I could sense everything around me with incredible accuracy. It seemed that a sense of senses had been activated within me.

As I walked with my Dad back to our car, I noticed that my Dad Senses had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate every move my kids were about to get hurt. Now I could sense danger before it happened. It was like I had become a superhero, with the power to protect my kids from harm.

From that day on, I knew I had been given a life-long gift. I had always been a protective father, but now God had taught me how to take it to the next level. I could sense danger before anyone else, and I could react before anyone else even knew what was going on.

As we got into the car, my kids looked at me with concern. But I smiled , and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's got dad Senses. Thanks to my Dad Senses, we'll always be safe."
