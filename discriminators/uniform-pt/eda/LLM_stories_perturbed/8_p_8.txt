As a child, Sarah always felt out of place. She struggled to eschew the pressures of society, and often found solace in books about the supernatural. It wasn't until her teenage years that she discovered her true nature as a witch, and suddenly everything made sense. Being a witch wasn't easy. Society didn't accept her, and it was often ostracized and ignored when Sarah stumbled upon a spell that promised to give her the power to make anyone love her, she couldn't resist.

The spell worked, but it came with a dark cost. Sarah discovered that the love she received was not natural, but forced. She had become a puppet master, pulling the strings of everything to suit her own desires.

For years, Sarah used her power to manipulate those around her, always thirsting for more. But as time went on, she began to feel a deep emptiness within her. She realized that true love and marriage could never be forced, only earned.

Desperate to shake off this curse she had put on herself, looking for a way to find healing without using magic. And that's when she discovered the ancient ritual that promised to unburden her from a curse, but only through the sacrifice of an innocent life.

Sarah struggled with this decision for weeks, but ultimately her desire for redemption won out. And so, she lured an unsuspecting victim to her home and performed her second curse, watching in horror as the life drained from the innocent person before her.

As the curse was lifted and her power faded away, she was left with a newfound sense of fear and shame. She had become the monster she had always been and there was no going back.

But despite her regrets, Sarah knew that she had to face the consequences of her actions. And so, she turned herself in to the authorities, ready to undergo whatever punishment the state deemed necessary. For even in the depths of her depravity, she knew that she could never truly escape the horror of what she had done.
