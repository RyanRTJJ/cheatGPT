It was a perfect summer day, and I decided to take my kids to the park. They were ecstatic and couldn't wait to run around and play on the swings and slides. As we pulled into the park, I noticed some dark clouds looming in the distance, but I thought we had plenty of time to leave the park before the rain hit.

As my kids continued playing, I began to notice the telltale signs of a lightning strike. The hair on my arms began to stand up, and the air felt electrically charged. I immediately knew we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I dropped the kids and ran towards the nearest shelter. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning struck nearby, and I felt an excruciating pain coursing through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with my arms outstretched, and calling out my name.

It took me only a few moments to realize what had happened. I had been struck by lightning. As I got up, I noticed something strange. My senses had increased and I could sense everything around me with incredible accuracy. It was like a sixth sense had been activated within me.

As I walked with my mom back to our car, I realized that my Dad Senses had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate every move my kids â€™ lives were too hard to make, and I could sense danger before they did. It was like I had become a superhero with the ability to protect my kids from harm.

From that day on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had always been a protective father, but now I could take it to the next level. Now, I could sense danger before it happened, and I could react before anyone else even knew what was going on.

As we got into their cars with the emergency exit, my kids looked up at me with concern. But I looked at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's got this. With my Dad Senses, we'll always be safe."
