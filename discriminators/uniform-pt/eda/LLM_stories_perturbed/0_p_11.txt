John had always been fascinated by the idea of immortality. He had spent years researching and solving mysteries in his basement laboratory, but now he had done it. He had discovered the secret to immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined all the incredible things he could accomplish now that he had all the time in the world. But suddenly, Death appeared before him, handing him a business card with a cryptic message. "When you're living , call this number. I've got a job offer for you."

John was confused but intrigued. He was still not seeing why Death would offer him a job, but he decided to keep quiet and continue with his newfound immortality.

At first, John was thrilled with his longevity. He traveled the world, learned new skills, and amassed a fortune. But as time went on, John realized that living forever wasn't as wonderful as he had thought it would be.

He watched as his loved ones aged and passed away, leaving him alone in a world was constantly changing. He saw wars and disasters that he could do nothing to prevent. He felt like a prisoner in his own body, unable to escape the monotony of endless days.

It was then that Death remembered the business card Death had given him. He decided to call Death. He was curious to see what kind of connection Death could have with an immortal man like himself.

To his surprise, Death answered the phone, his voice calm and reassuring. "I knew John would call eventually," he said. "I have a job offer for you, John. I need someone to help me manage the afterlife, someone to see what it's like to live forever."

John couldn't believe what he was hearing. But as Death explained the details of the job, John realized that this was the job he had been looking for. He could finally use his gifts to help others, to guide them through the afterlife and ensure their final journeys found peace.

And so, John accepted the job offer and began a new chapter of his endless life. He no longer felt trapped in his immortality and instead embraced it as a tool to help others find theirs. And though he still had mortal friends and family, he knew that he was where he was meant to be.
