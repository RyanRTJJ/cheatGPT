It was a sunny and beautiful day, and I decided to take the kids to the park. They were ecstatic and couldn't wait to get on the swings and slides. As we arrived, I noticed some dark clouds looming in the distance, but I thought we had plenty of time to relax and enjoy the park before the rain hit.

As my kids were playing, I started to notice the telltale signs of being in a thunderstorm. The hair on my arms began to stand up, and the air felt electrically charged. I immediately knew we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my kids and ran towards an emergency shelter. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning flew nearby, and I felt an excruciating pain coursing through my body. The next thing I knew I was lying on the ground, with my kids crying and calling out my name.

It took me a few moments to realize what had happened. I had been struck by lightning. As I got up, I noticed something strange. My senses were heightened, and I could sense them around me with incredible accuracy. It was like a sixth sense had been activated within me.

As I walked with my kids back to our car, I realized that my Dad Senses had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate what lay ahead in my kids were about to make, and I could sense danger before it happened. It was like I had become a protective father, with the ability to protect my kids from harm.

From that moment on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had always been a protective father, but now I could take it to the next level. I saw danger before anyone else did and I backed out before anyone else even knew what was going on.

As we got into the car, my kids looked up at me with concern. But I smiled at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's got this. With my help, we'll always be safe."
