For as long as he could remember, Tyler had always had the same recurring dream. In it, he would find himself wandering through a world filled with strange creatures and towering castles. And every time, he would be visited by a strange girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She never introduced herself, but over time, they became close friends, exploring the dream world together and sharing secrets that kept them apart. As Tyler grew older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got married, and started building a life . But he never forgot about the girl from his dreams, and sometimes he would catch himself daydreaming about her.

One day, while walking down the park, Tyler saw her. The girl from his dreams. She was sitting on the bench at the edge of the park, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he must be imagining things, but as he got closer, he could see that it was really her. She looked older, of course, but the sparkling eyes and mischievous smile were still there.

Tyler walked up to her and said hello, but she looked at him with a blank expression and went on as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding her of their adventures in the dream world, but she just shook her head and said she had to go.

For weeks, Tyler tried to find her, but she seemed to be avoiding him. Finally, one day, he managed to catch her alone. He canâ€™t tell Laura why she was acting so strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him with some confusion and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I can't explain it right now. It's too complicated."

Tyler looked at her for more information, but she refused to say anything. As she walked away, he couldn't shake a sense of loss. The girl from his dreams had been real all along, but now she seemed to be slipping away from him once again.

For months, he tried to forget about her, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something important he was missing. Then, one night, he had a dream. In it, he was in the fantastical world, and there she was, the girl from his dreams, waiting for him.

As they explored the world once again, she finally explained everything to him. She was a child of the fantastical worlds, a guide who helped people navigate the complexities of her own dreams. Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she had been tasked with guiding through his dreams. But now that he was an adult, it was time for her to move on to other responsibilities.

Tyler woke up feeling both relieved and grateful. He had finally gotten the answers he had been seeking, but he knew he would never see her again. But as he went about his day, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the time they had shared together, both in his dreams and in the world of reality.
