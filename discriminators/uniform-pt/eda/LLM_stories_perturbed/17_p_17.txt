Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who had the unique power to control every aspect of her life. In her dreams, she could fly, visit fantastical lands, and be anyone she wanted to be. Her dreams were so vivid and exciting that she started to view her waking life as a waiting period between nightmare endings. The young girl would spend her days in a daze, daydreaming about the adventures that awaited her in her next dream. She stopped paying attention in class and stopped participating in activities with her friends. All she wanted was to sleep so she could enter her dream world again.

One day, while in the middle of a particularly exciting dream, Lily heard a voice calling out to her. "Lily, wake up! You need to hear this!" Startled, Lily opened her eyes and found herself staring into the face of her mother.

"What's wrong?" Lily asked, waking up from sleep.

"I'm worried about you, Lily," her mother said. "You've been spending all your time sleeping and neglecting your responsibilities. is to start putting more effort into your waking habits." At first, she brushed off her mother's concerns, insisting that her dreams were all that mattered. But her mother persisted, telling her that life was full of experiences and opportunities that she was missing out on by spending all her time asleep.

Slowly but surely, Lily began to see her mother's point. She started paying attention in class , tried extra classes, and even joined a few extracurricular groups at school. She found that by putting in effort in her waking life, she was able to achieve things that she had only ever dreamt of before.

Over time, Lily began to realize that life was just as exciting and full of adventure as her dreams. She still looked forward to sleeping and controlling her dreams, but now she was also waking and excited to see what the day would bring. She learned that life was worth living and that by putting in the work, she could achieve amazing things both in her waking life and in her dreams.
