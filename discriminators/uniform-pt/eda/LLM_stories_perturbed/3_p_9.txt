For as long as he could remember, Tyler had always had the same recurring dream. In it, he would find himself wandering through a fantastical world filled with fairy wings and towering castles. And every time he entered the castle, he would be joined by a strange girl with sparkling eyes and a mischievous smile. She never introduced herself, but over time, they became close friends, exploring the dream world together and sharing secrets and stories.

As Tyler grew older, the dreams began to fade, replaced by the realities of adulthood. He went to college, got a job, and started building a life for himself. He never forgot about Tyler from his dreams, and sometimes he would catch himself daydreaming about her.

One day, while walking through the park, Tyler saw her. The girl from his dreams. She was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. At first, Tyler thought he must have seen things, but as he got closer, he could see that it was really her. She looked older, of course, but the sparkling eyes and mischievous smile were still there.

Tyler walked up to her and said hello, but she just looked at him with a blank expression, as if she didn't know who he was. He tried to jog her memory, reminding her of her adventures in the dream world, but she just shook her head and said she had forgotten. For three weeks, Tyler tried to find her again, but she seemed to be avoiding him. Finally, one day, he managed to catch her alone. He asked her why why she was acting so strange, why she didn't seem to remember him. She looked at him with sad eyes and said, "I remember you, Tyler. But I can't explain it right now. It's too complicated."

Tyler pressed her for more information, but she walked off to see someone else. As she walked away, he couldn't help but feel a terrible sense of loss. The girl from his dream had been real all along, but now she seemed to be slipping away from him once again.

For months, Tyler tried to forget about her, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was nothing he was missing. Then, one night, he had a dream. In it, he was back in this fantastical world, and there she was, the girl from his dreams, waiting for him. The next day, while they explored the dream world once again, she finally explained everything to him. She was a traveler between worlds, a guide that helps people navigate the complexities of the multiverse. Tyler had been one of her charges, someone she'd been tasked with guiding through his dreams. But now that he was an adult, it was time for her to move on to other responsibilities.

Tyler woke up feeling both relieved and saddened. He had finally gotten the answers he had been seeking, but he knew he would never see her again. As Jack went about his day, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the time they had shared together, both in his dreams and in the brief moments of reality.
