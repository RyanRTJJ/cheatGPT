As Director General of NASA, I've come to understand the extraordinary way that the Earth is orbiting its solar system. It's a well-guarded secret, known only to a select few within the government and the scientific community. So when the incoming President asked me why we've kept this information hidden from the public, I had to think carefully about how to respond.

"Mr. President, the reason we've kept this a secret is because it would cause mass panic and chaos if the world were to learn the truth," I said. "What would that be?" the President asked, clearly confused.

"Well, for one thing, it would completely undermine our understanding of the law of gravity, of the laws of physics," I said. "It would also raise a lot of questions about our place in the world and our purpose as a species."

The President nodded thoughtfully. "I see your points," I said. "But don't you think the public has a right to know the truth?"

I sighed. "Yes, of course they do. But then there needs to be some truth about how we reveal this information. I want to make sure that people understand the seriousness of this news and the implications of what it means for our world."

The President nodded again, and I could tell he was deep in his thoughts. "Thank you for your honesty, and for sharing this information with me," he said.

As he left my office, I couldn't help but feel sense of relief. It wasn't easy keeping such a big secret for so long, but I knew that we were doing the right thing by keeping the truth hidden for so long. Maybe one day, when humanity is ready, we can reveal the truth and begin to explore the mysteries of our flat Earth.
