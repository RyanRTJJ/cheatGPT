The alien overlord, Zaxar, was furious. He had sent his best troops to Gorg's side the day before, and had given them the most advanced weapons to destroy the puny humans. But now, he had heard reports that their assault was failing.

"What do you mean they ate your soldiers?" Zaxar bellowed at his son Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the humans have developed a liking for our weaponry, sir. They've been consuming it instead of being harmed by it."

Zaxar's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's impossible. How can they eat our weapons?"

Gorg cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that the humans have been experimenting with genetically modified which can digest inorganic material, including metal. They've been feeding these crops to their livestock, and now the humans themselves have developed a taste for them."

Zaxar rubbed his scaly chin, laughing. What a strange thought. He had not anticipated this development. His fleet had been conquering other planets throughout the galaxy, and never had it encountered a species that could consume their food," Zaxar finally said. "We will need to adapt our technology to send a message to our scientists to develop a new kind of weapon that humans cannot eat. We will not be defeated by a race of beings who eat metal."

As for what message to relay Zaxar's orders, the alien overlord couldn't help but feel a kind of slightly grudging respect for the humans. They were so intelligent, so resourceful, and their determination to survive was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
