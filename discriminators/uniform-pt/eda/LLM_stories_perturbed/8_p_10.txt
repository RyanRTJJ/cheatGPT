As a child, Sarah was often lonely and out of place. She struggled to make friends and found solace in books about the supernatural. It wasn't until her teenage years that she discovered her true nature as a witch, and suddenly everything made sense.

But being a witch was not easy. Society didn't accept her, and she was often ostracized and bullied. So when Sarah stumbled upon a spell that promised to grant her the power to make anyone love her, she couldn't resist.

The spell worked, but it came with a dark cost. Sarah discovered that the love she received wasn't genuine, but forced. She had become a puppet , pulled by the strings of people's hearts , but she was the one who had put it all into her own desires.

For years, she used her power to manipulate those around her, always thirsting for more. But as time went on, she began to feel the emptiness within her. She realized that true love and acceptance could never be forced, only earned.

Desperate to break the curse she had put on herself, Sarah searched for a way to undo the damage. And that's when she discovered the ancient , unseen woman who promised to lift the curse, but only through the sacrifice of an innocent life.

Sarah struggled with the decision for weeks, but ultimately her desire for redemption won out so, and she took an unsuspecting victim to her home and performed the ritual, watching impatiently as the power from the curse drained from the innocent person before her.

As the curse was lifted and Sarah's shadow faded away, she was left with a newfound sense of guilt and shame. She had become the monster she had always feared, and there was no going back.

But despite her regrets, Sarah knew that she had to face the consequences of her actions. And so, she turned herself in to the authorities, ready to face whatever punishment awaited her. For even in the depths of her depravity, she knew that she could not escape the weight of what she had done.
