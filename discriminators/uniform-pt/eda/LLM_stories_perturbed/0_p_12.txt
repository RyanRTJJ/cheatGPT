John had always been fascinated with the idea of immortality. He had spent years thinking about it, re-calculating and experimenting in a laboratory, and finally, he had done it. He had discovered the secret to immortality.

Overjoyed, John imagined the incredible things he could accomplish now that he had all the power in the world. But suddenly, Death appeared before him, holding a business card with a cryptic message. "When you realize living forever sucks, give me your phone number. I've got a job offer for you."

John was confused but intrigued. He couldn't imagine why Death would offer him a job, but he decided to keep the card and use his newfound immortality.

At first, John was thrilled with his newfound longevity. He traveled the world, learned new skills, and accumulated a fortune. But as time went on, John came to realize that living out his newfound longevity was not as easy as he had thought it would be.

He watched as his loved ones aged and passed away, leaving him alone in a world and his outlook was constantly changing. He saw wars and catastrophes that he could do nothing to prevent. He felt like a prisoner in his own body, unable to escape the monotony of endless days.

It was then he remembered the business card Death had given him. He decided to call the number, curious to see what kind of job offer Death could have for an immortal man like himself.

To his surprise, the Caller took the call, his voice calm and reassuring. "I knew you would call eventually," he said. "I don't really feel like Death has much job offer for me anymore. I need someone to help me manage the afterlife, someone who understands what it's like , forever."

John couldn't believe what he was hearing. But as he explained the details of the job, John realized that this was exactly what he had been looking for. He could finally use his immortality to help others, to guide them through the dark times and ensure that they had eternal peace.

And so, John accepted the job offer and began a new chapter in his endless life. He no longer felt the burden of his immortality but instead embraced his endless life as a tool to help others find their way. And though he still missed his mortal friends and family, he knew that he was where he was meant to be.
