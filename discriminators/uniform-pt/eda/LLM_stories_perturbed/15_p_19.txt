The Emperor was Zaxar, Captain Khan of Mars. He had sent his troops to invade Earth and had given them the most advanced weapons to destroy the puny humans. But now, he was receiving reports that their assault was failing.

"What do you mean by our ammunition?" Zaxar bellowed at his second-in-command, Gorg.

Gorg shifted uncomfortably under Zaxar's piercing gaze. "It seems that the humans have developed a taste for our weaponry, sir. They've been consuming it instead of being destroyed by it."

Zaxar's eyes swept open in disbelief. "That's impossible. How can they eat your weaponry?" He cleared his throat nervously. "It appears that they have been experimenting with genetically modified crops that were grown for inorganic gold and silver metal. They've been feeding these crops to their livestock, and now the humans themselves have developed a taste for them."

Zaxar rubbed his scaly chin, deep in thought. He had not anticipated this development. The human race had been conquering other planets for thousands of years, and never had they encountered creatures that could consume their weapons.

"Very well," Zaxar finally said. "We will need to adapt our strategy. Gorg, I want to relay our message to our scientists to develop a new kind of weapon that humans cannot eat. We will not be defeated by a species of beings who eat metal."

As Gorg left to relay Zaxar's orders, the alien overlord couldn't help but feel a sense of grudging gratitude for the humans. They were resourceful, and their determination to survive was impressive. Zaxar knew that the battle for Earth was far from over, but he was determined to emerge victorious, no matter what it took.
