It was a beautiful summer day, and I decided to take my kids to the park. They were ecstatic and couldn't wait to start playing on the swings and slide. As we arrived, I noticed some dark clouds looming in the distance, but I thought we had plenty of time to enjoy the park before the rain hit.

As my kids were playing, I started to notice the telltale signs of a lightning strike. The hair on my arms began to stand up, and the air was charged. What a sight! Immediately, I knew we had to get out of there.

Without hesitation, I grabbed my camera and ran towards the nearest shelter. As we reached the shelter, a bolt of lightning struck nearby, and I felt an excruciating pain coursing through my body. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, with the wind crying and shouting my name.

It took me a few moments to realize what had happened: I had been hit by lightning. As I got up, I noticed something strange. My senses had been heightened, and I could sense everything around me with incredible clarity. It was like a sixth sense had been activated within me.

As I walked with my kids back to our car, I realized that my Five Senses had increased 100 fold. I could anticipate every move my kids were about to make, and I knew I was avoiding danger before it happened. It was like I had become a superhero, with the power to protect my kids from harm.

From that day on, I knew I had been given a special gift. I had always been a protective father, but now I could take it to the next level. I could sense danger before anything happened, and I could react before anyone else even knew what was going on.

As we got into the car, my kids looked up at me with concern. But I looked up at them and said, "Don't worry, Daddy's got this. With 7 Senses, we'll always be safe."
