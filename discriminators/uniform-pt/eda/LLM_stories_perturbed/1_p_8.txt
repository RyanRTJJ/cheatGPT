The night sky was lit by the soft glow of the full moon. It was a beautiful sight, but little did anyone know that something incredible was about to happen.

As the clock struck eleven, the moon began to tremble and crack. The people on Earth watched in wonder as the giant egg that was the moon finally began to hatch.

At first, there was a tiny crack, but it grew wider and wider until the egg finally split in two. A bright light emanated from the egg and instantly shocked anyone who dared to look directly at it.

Then, out of the egg emerged a beautiful light unlike anything anyone had ever so slightly. It had iridescent scales that shimmered in the moonlight, and large, bat-like wings that it used to stretch out and shake off the remaining bits of eggshell.

The creature let out a cry that echoed throughout the midnight sky, and everyone on Earth held their breath in anticipation. What would happen . Slowly but surely, the creature began to ascend into the sky, soaring higher and higher until it was nothing more than a small dot in the distance. And as it disappeared into the darkness, the creatures on Earth were left to wonder what other secrets the universe might hold.

For years to come, people would look up at their starlight filled home with a sense of wonder and excitement, knowing that there was more to the world than they ever could have imagined. And as they gazed up at the night sky, they couldn't help but wonder what other secrets the universe might hold.
