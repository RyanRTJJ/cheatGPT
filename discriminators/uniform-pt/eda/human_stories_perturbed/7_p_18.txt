“ Sadie ! I told you not to stand under the road in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” 

My daughter dialed 911 , as I laid there , shocked . My cousin called back that night. 

“ Hello ? ! My daughter was just struck- “ 

All of a sudden , something . “ It was definitely a good thing . I sat up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’t tell . Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong. and it was nearby . 

“ If I take 295 south right now , I can be at Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And then I can finally build that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale . I can feel it in my throat. Now you know , they ’ what colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest color out there , and you ’ d have to have picked a birch to say otherwise. ” 

My mom looked back at me , a hint of a twinkle in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : delight! 

“ You know what else ? I ’ m gon na get like , 50 windows from craigslist , they have the largest glass panes , and make a greenhouse ! ” She started, but the words kept spilling out of my mouth . But something else was off here . Something with my house… 

Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I was supposed to be filled with fear. I jumped the rest of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house , the computer, and his brother ’ s laptop was . 

“ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about this house ? ! He could ’ ve sold the whole house ! ”
