The vast hull of the X'tac ship emerged a few hundred miles away from the face of the earth . Hatu sat in his chrome throne in the control room , gazing at the blue planet that lay in wait beneath them . They 'd sent scouts eons ago and now the time to reap their team 's bounty had died. He crossed his fingers in an almost absent gesture . Beside him , his second barked out the orders . All ready , subordinates scurried around , beginning the assault . Canisters of poison shot out from the cannons . The canisters had been made to explode upon touching the atmosphere the acid would vaporize , but then , when it rained , it would rain acid . All there was left to do was wait and Hatu was patient . 

Hatu was not _this_ patient . It 'd been raining acid on the planet for weeks , and then slowed down when the planet rotated upon its tilted , but still the humans would come and take his slaves . He 'd been told kings would beg to give him water and algae . That he could plunder their lands to his fill . Why did the humans not cry for succor ? 

A subordinate bowed low before Hatu Hatu waved his hand and his second barked at the subordinate . <unk> Captain'Hatu! '' he charged . 

`` Sir , '' the subordinate said , shaking in fear but keeping the tremor out of his voice , `` our attack is failing . We are running low on ammunition . '' 

`` What ! '' Hatu roared . There was just the briefest moment of satisfaction when everyone started at the power of his voice . `` How is the subordinate ? '' 

The subordinate looked down now , but failed to meet Hatu 's eyes . Hatu shook his head at him . `` You will answer me , scum . '' 

`` Sir , '' the subordinate said , voice barely above the scream , and continued, 'There are apparently a number of earthlings . They-they appear to beâ€¦they appear to be drinking our poison . '' 

`` In fact , many people have been burned in large urns , '' another voice said from somewhere behind him . 

Hatu could feel the eyes of his subordinates upon him , looking to him for guidance , all he could think was , `` If the acid from the orange fruit could not burn the humans , if they could so boldly choose not to fight their enemies , what use was any of their weapons ?"<unk>
