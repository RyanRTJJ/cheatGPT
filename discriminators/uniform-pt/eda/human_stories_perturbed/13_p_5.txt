I 'm really not sure why I took this job . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with a mix of hope and despair . I have family members who are pardoned Death Eaters , and they feel the same way . 

I may not be may be sheep of the family , thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters , but I do get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well , fuck them . I get jealous whenever I'm lucky enough to sit on some semi inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new spells . 

Why am I near Iceland ? Because my research is the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall to see what can be done. Highly volatile spells come out of my research . The Ministry of Magic made this post about a decade after they finally put Voldemort down for good . As the son of decorated Aurors , I was able to get the job pretty easily . My dad and my mother offered me the opportunity to display both the pedigree and the skill . 

Also , as my former supervisor said , I 'm one crazy son of a bitch . 

He 's my former supervisor because one day , working on that spell , he disappeared. His whereabouts are unknown , but there are rumors that he 's using his magic to great success in Vegas , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . 

Now , I 'm the boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh faced kid out of Hogwarts , who takes everything too seriously . I worry about his ability to keep up in this line of work . Between the remote location and the dangers of the work , he 's ripe to crack up . 

`` So , what are we working on today ? '' the Kid asks . 

`` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Evil Ones rise as normal again. '' 

`` But , but , my Defend Against The Dark Arts says that the Old Ones can never rise again . '' 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , the stars could be right at any moment , then we all could be shit out of the whole world '' 

I have to remind the kid of that a lot . He 's putting on his robes too like he 's about to go to some damn Potions and such! Meanwhile , I used a '' loan spell ( I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas Police Department . They have nice toys ( like an ATV ) . 

`` So , what 's our first spell going to be . 

`` Special banishment spell , '' I reply . `` One to cross over dimensional walls . '' 

No wizard , even that Potter guy , could singlehandedly banish an entire population . But if enough talented wizards cast it , the spell might have a chance . Might . 

The Kid did n't need to say part . 

`` There 's a spell I put together to get rid of a few Dementors , '' I continue . `` Did you prepare such a presentation ? '' 

`` Yes , I did . Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts `` 

I shake my head and say that Hogwarts should really at least offer computers to students the way a DVD players is to its students . 

`` Today we 're going to basically take that spell and crank it up a few notches . Let 's make sure you 've got the basic spell down before we continue . '' 

`` Alright , '' he replies 

`` Remember : right arm fully extended , off to the side . Swing it in a controlled motion across your body . '' 

`` I can go again , '' I reply , a little more confident than I like <unk>... Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What 's the case? ? '' 

`` Piercus Four , '' he answers . 

`` Good , let 's see you do it . '' 

The kid steps on the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into the kitchen. <unk> No , I know it has gone to shit . He does n't extend how arm far enough from his body and moves way too fast . Before I can yell for him to stop the fateful words come from his mouth . ''Forty Four ! '' 

The space around him blurs . By keeping his arm close to his head and moving too fast he redirects his eyes on me and at himself . My worst fears are now confirmed. I know when that space stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . 

Shit . 

Now I have to go find him .
