I 'm really not sure why I took this job . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They look at me with a mix of shame and despair . I 've got family members, who too are pardoned Death Eaters , and they feel the same way . They simply could not be the black sheep of the family , just like the aforementioned Death Eaters , but I do n't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well no need to be one of them . I get paid enough to sit on some semi inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new spells . 

Why am I near Iceland ? Because my attempts at research are the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks . Highly volatile spells come easy and in my research . The Ministry created this post about a decade after they finally put it on the Internet for good . As the son of decorated Aurors , I was able to get the job pretty easily . I didn 't have any credentials, so my resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill . 

Also , as my former supervisor said , I 'm one crazy son of a bitch . 

He 's my former supervisor because one day , working on a teleportation device, and he vanished . His whereabouts are unknown, but there are rumors that he 's using his magic to great success in Vegas , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . 

Now , I 'm the boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh faced kid out of Hogwarts who takes everything way too seriously . I worry about his ability to hold up in this line of work . Between the remote location and nature of our work , he 's ripe to crack up . 

`` So , what are you currently working on today , the Kid asks . 

`` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones rise . '' 

`` But , but , my Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again . '' 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , the stars could swing right at any moment , then we all could be shit out of luck . '' 

I have to remind the muggle that a lot . He 's wrapped in his robes , looking like he 's about to go to some damn Potions . Meanwhile , I used a proven teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` teleport to a house that currently has full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas Police Department . They have nice toys in Texas . 

`` So , what 's our <unk> mission going to be ? '' 

`` Special banishment spell , '' I reply . `` One to cross over dimensional walls . '' 

No wizard , even that Potter guy , could singlehandedly banish an Old One . '' If enough people got involved , the spell might have worked . Might . 

The Kid did n't need to know that part . 

`` There 's a baseline spell I put on it, it will get rid of a few Dementors before I continue . `` Did you watch the presentation ? '' 

`` Yes I did . Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts `` 

I shake my head . Hogwarts is to its wizards at least the way a DVD players is to its students . 

`` Okay , we 're going to take that spell and crank it up a few notches . Let 's make sure you 've got the basic spell down before we continue talking. '' 

`` I got your right arm there, '' he replies 

`` Remember : right arm fully extended , off to the side . Swing it in a controlled motion across your body . '' 

`` I got you , '' he says , a little more confident than I was. Damn Gryffindors are always like the kids? 

`` What 's the activation phrase ? '' 

`` Piercus Four , '' <unk> The kid steps on a chair . 

`` Good , let 's see you do it . '' 

The kid steps over to the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into the motion , I know it has gone to shit . He does not want to show us how arm is far away from his body and he moves way too fast . Before I can yell for him to stop , the fateful words come from his mouth . 

`` Piercus Four ! '' 

The space between us now blurs . By keeping too close and going too fast he redirects the spell at himself . My worst fears are confirmed when that space stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . He is a man . 

Now I need to go find him .
