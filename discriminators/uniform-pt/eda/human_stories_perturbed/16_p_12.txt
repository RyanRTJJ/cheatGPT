The vast hull of the X'tac was a million miles from the surface of the Blue planet. Hatu sat in his chrome throne in the control room , his eyes on the hull of the ship and he looked out at the blue planet slowly spinning beneath them . The Empire sent scouts eons ago and now the time to reap the planet 's bounty had come . He raised his fingers in an almost absent gesture . Beside him , a servant barked out the orders . All around him , subordinates scurried around , beginning the assault . Canisters of poison exploded from the cannons . The canisters had been made to explode upon entry into the . The acid would vaporize , but then , when it rained , it would rain acid . All there was left to do now was wait and hope for the patient . 

Hatu was not _this_ patient . They 'd been raining acid on the hill for several weeks . Still the acid would fall upon its tilted axis and still the humans did not come and try to live in the cave . He 'd been told kings would beg to live in his pots of water and algae . That he could plunder their lands to his fill . Why did the humans not cry for help? 

A subordinate bowed low before him. Hatu waved his hand and his second barked at the subordinate to proceed . 

`` Sir , '' Hatu said , shaking in fear but admirably shaking the little tremor out of his voice , <unk> <unk> The attack is failing and we are running low on ammunition . '' 

`` What ! '' Hatu roared . There was just the briefest moment of satisfaction when everyone started at the power of his voice . `` How is this possible ? '' 

The subordinate looked down now and cowed to meet Hatu 's eyes . Hatu glowered at him . `` I answer to your question , scum ,'' the subordinate laughed softly 

`` Sir , '' a voice said , voice barely above a whisper . " This is not a matter of the earthlings . They-they appear to beâ€¦they appear to be drinking our poison . '' 

`` In fact , many people have been collecting it in large urns , '' another voice piped into the room behind him . 

Hatu could feel the eyes of his subordinates upon him , looking to him for guidance , but all he could think of was <unk> `` If the acid from the orange fruit were enough to burn the humans , if they could so boldly drink that , what use was any of their weapons ? ''
