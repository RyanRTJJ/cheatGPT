“ Sadie ! I told you not to stand under the tree - “ I had told you a few minutes earlier about being in the middle of a tree- ” 

My mom frantically dialed 911 , as I laid there shocked . Literally . 

“ Hello ? ! My daughter was just struck- “ 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . “ I quickly picked me head up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’t tell . Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong , and it was nearby . 

“ If I take 295 south right now , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat . Now, I can finally build that deck you always wanted , they have the planks on sale in the store. I can feel it in my blood . Now , I know , they ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest color that pine is , and you would be a fool to say otherwise. ” 

My mom looked back at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : terror . 

“ You never know who else , I ’ m gon na get like , 50 windows from craigslist , they have the best deals , and a greenhouse ! ” 

Somehow , the words kept spilling out of my mouth . But something else was off here . Something with the elevator. 

Suddenly , I knew . I could feel my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with rage . I jumped up the stairs, pushed everyone out of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house , and noticed my brother ’ s laptop was . 

“ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! And why didn ’ t he care what he did to the house ? ! He could ’ ve burned the whole place down ! ”
