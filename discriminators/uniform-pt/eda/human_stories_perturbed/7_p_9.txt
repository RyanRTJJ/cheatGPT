“ Sadie ! I told her to stand under the tree in the back yard right before a thunderstorm ! ” 

My mom frantically dialed 911 , as I laid there , shocked . Literally . 

“ Hello . My daughter was just struck- “ 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . I woke up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it the power of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . Nor did I care . “” Something was definitely wrong , and it was nearby . 

“ If I take 295 south right now , I can get to Home Depot in 15 minutes flat . And then I can get that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale . I can have this thing in my blood . Now , I know , they ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted it and it was beautiful, but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest color out there , it ’ d be a birch to say otherwise. ” 

My mom looked back at me , a hint of pity in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : terror . 

“ You know what else ? I ’ m gon na get like , 50 windows from craigslist , they have the best shape , and make it my house! So bad ! ” as the words kept spilling out my mouth . But something else was off here . Something with my house… 

Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood sweat, and my heart pound. I continued to be filled with rage . I jumped up the rest of the way , and dashed some blocks to my house , where my brother ’ s laptop was . 

“ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t someone worry about this house ? You. could ’ ve burned the whole place down before...?
