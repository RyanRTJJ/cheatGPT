“ . “ That’s what I told you to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” 

My mom frantically dialed 911 , as I laid there , shocked . Literally . 

“ Hello ? ! My daughter was just struck- “ 

All of a sudden I hear something was wrong . I sat up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or had it been the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’t tell . Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong , and it was nearby . 

“ If I take 295 Hwy. So now , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And then , and then, when you decide to finally build that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale . I have it in my blood . Now , I know , they ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine . But I hear you here . Plum is the pinest color out there , and it d be a birch to say otherwise. ” 

My mom looked back at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : jealous. 

“ Now what else ? I ’ m gon na get like , 50 windows from craigslist , they have the ones, half frame , and make a greenhouse ! ” 

Somehow , the words kept spilling out of my mouth . But something else was off here . Something with my head. 

Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with sensations. I jumped up the rest of the way , jumping around the two blocks to my house , where my Dad ’ s laptop was . 

“ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he have this house ? ! He could ’ t shut the whole place down ! ”
