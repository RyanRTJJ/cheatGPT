I 'm really not sure why I took this job . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with a mix of shame and despair . I 've got family members who are pardoned Death Knights and they look at me with the same mixture of shame and despair. 

I may not be the black sheep of the family , thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters , but I do n't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well , have to learn from them . I get paid decently enough and sleep on some remote island around Iceland to come up with new spells . 

Why am I near Iceland ? In other words, my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks . Highly volatile spells come from my research . The Ministry created this post about a decade after having put Voldemort down for good . As the son of decorated Aurors , I was gonna get the job pretty easily . My resume boasted both the pedigree and the training. 

Also , as my former supervisor said , `` I 'm one hell of a bitch . '' 

He 's my former supervisor because one day , working on a teleportation spell , if you will . His whereabouts are not known , but there are rumors that he 's using his magic to great success in Vegas , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . 

Now , I am his boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh I'm in love with a guy fresh out of Hogwarts , who takes everything way too seriously . I worry about his ability to hold up in this line of work . Between the remote location and the nature of our work , it 's ripe to crack up . 

`` So , what are we working on today ? '' the Kid asks . 

`` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones rise up. 

`` But , but , my Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise up . '' 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , the stars could be right at any moment , then we all get shit ed for being really bad luck . '' 

I have to remind the kid of that a lot . He 's still wearing his boyish expression , looking like he 's about to go to some damn Potions lecture . Meanwhile , I used a proven teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` borrow some SWAT Team gear from the Dallas Police Department . They have nice uniforms... I like Texas . So , what 's our first spell going to be ? '' 

`` Special banishment spell , '' I gnorance `` One to cross over dimensional a, '' 

No wizard , even a strong guy , could singlehandedly banish an Old One . But if enough talented wizards got involved , the spell might have a chance . Might . 

The Kid did n't need to be a part of that. There 's a baseline spell I put together to get rid of a few Dementors , '' I continue . `` Did you watch the presentation ? 

`` Yes , I did . Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts `` 

I shake my head . Hogwarts should really at least understand what a DVD game can do to its students . 

`` Okay , we 're going to basically take that spell and turn it up a few notches . Let 's make sure you 've got the basic spell down before we continue . '' <unk> Now , '' he says. 

`` Remember : right arm fully extended , off to the side . Move in a controlled motion across your body . '' 

`` I got you , '' he says , a little more confident than I like . Damn Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What 's the activation phrase ? <unk> Piercus Four , '' he answers . 

`` Good , let 's see you do it . '' 

The kid steps over to the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into his room, <unk> Piercy , I know it has gone to shit . He does n't extend how arm far enough from his body and he moves way too fast . Before I get a chance to yell for him to stop , the fateful words come from his mouth . 

`` Piercus Four ! Piercus Four! The space around him blurs . By keeping his arm and not going too fast he throws a spell at himself . My worst fears are confirmed when that space stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . Who have I got? 

Now I have to go find him .
