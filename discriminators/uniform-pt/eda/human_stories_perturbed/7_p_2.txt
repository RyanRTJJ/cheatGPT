“ Sadie ! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” She frantically dialed 911 , and she laid there , shocked . Literally . 

“ Hello ? Your daughter was just struck- “ 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . I tried my fingertips with both hands , my fingertips with the help of this new force armed by this new power . Or was it the new design of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong , and it was nearby . 

“ If I take 295 south right , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And then I can finally build that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have all these fabulous lumber on sale . I can feel it in my blood . Now , I know , they ’ re plum colored pine. My mother did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out . Plum is currently the pinest color out there , and you ’ d be a birch to say otherwise. ”

I laughed and whistled and cursed the rest of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house ! ” I called my brother ’ s house . 

“ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in. ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about this house ? ! He could ’ ve burned the whole place down ! ”
