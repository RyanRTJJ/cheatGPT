I 'm really not sure why I took this job . I have family members who are retired . They view me with a mix of shame and despair . I 've got family members who are pardoned Death Eaters , and they're both feeling the same way . 

I may not be the black sheep of the family , thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters but still I do n't get a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well , fuck them . I get paid per month for life to sit on some semi inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new . 

Why are near Iceland ? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks . Highly volatile spells come out of my research . The Ministry created this post about a year after they finally put Voldemort down for good . As the son of decorated Aurors , I was going to get the job pretty easily . My resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill . 

Also , as my former supervisor said, `` I 'm one crazy son of a bitch . '' 

He told my former supervisor because one day , working on a teleportation spell , he vanished . His whereabouts remain unknown , but there are rumors that he 's using his magic to great success in Vegas , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . 

Now , I'm the boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh faced kid out of Hogwarts , who takes everything way too seriously . I worry about his ability to hold his own in this line of work . With our remote location and the dangers of our work , he 's ripe to fail . 

`` So , what are we working on today ? '' the Kid asks . 

`` The Ministry wants to start coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones rise again . '' 

`` But fortunately , my Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again . '' 

`` You 're not in control anymore , the stars could be right at any moment , we all could be shit out of luck . '' 

I have to remind the kid of that a lot. '' He 's still wearing his robes , looking like he 's about to go to some , lecture . Meanwhile , I used a proven teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck in understand those ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team gear from the Houston Police Department . They have nice toys in Texas . 

`` So , what 's our first spell going to be ? '' 

`` Special form, Sir , '' I reply . `` One to cross over dimensional walls . '' 

No wizard , not even a Tom Potter guy , could singlehandedly banish an Old One . But if enough talented wizards got involved , the spell might have a chance . Might . 

The Kid did n't need to know that part . 

`` There was this baseline spell I put together to get rid of a few Dementors , '' I continue . <unk> Did you see that presentation ? '' 

`` Yes , I did . Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts rewind the first time I shake my head . Hogwarts should really at least mention what a DVD players is to anyone that knows . 

`` Okay , we 're going to basically take that spell and crank it up a few notches . Let 's make sure we've got the basic spell down before we continue . '' 

`` Alright , '' Harry replies 

`` Remember : right arm in front , off to the side . Swing it in a controlled motion across your body . '' 

`` I got you , '' he says <unk> I was feeling a little more confident than I like . Damn Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What 's the activation phrase ? 

`` Piercus Four , '' he answers . <unk> Good , let 's see you do , '' 

The kid steps over to the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into the motion , I know it has gone to shit e. He does n't cross his arm far enough from his body and he moves way too fast . Before I can yell for him to stop , the fateful words come from him in my ear . 

`` Piercus Four ! '' 

The space around him blurs . By keeping his arm close and going too fast he redirects the spell at himself . My worst fears are confirmed as space stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . 

Shit , I have to go now .
