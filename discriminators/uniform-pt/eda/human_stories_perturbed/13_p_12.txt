, I am really not sure why I took this job . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with a mix of hopelessness and despair . I 've got family members who are pardoned Death Eaters , and they feel the same way . 

I may not be I may be the black sheep of the family , and am well known to the aforementioned Death Eaters , but I do n't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well , fuck them . I get paid decently enough to sit on some semi inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new spells . 

Why am I in Iceland ? Because my job is the reverse science â€“ throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks . Highly volatile spells come out of my research . The Ministry created this post about a decade ago, when they finally put Voldemort down for good . As the son of decorated Aurors , I was able to get the job pretty easily . My resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill . 

Also , as my former supervisor said , `` I 'm one hell of a bitch . '' 

He 's my former supervisor because one day , working on a teleportation spell , he vanished . His whereabouts are unknown , but there are hints he 's using his magic to great success in Vegas , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . 

Now , I 'm the boss . I 'm still working on my new spell. Fresh faced kid out of Hogwarts , who takes everything way too seriously . I worry about his ability to hold up in this line of work . Between the remote ness and the dangers of our work , he 's ripe to crack up . 

`` So , the problem here, is we working on today ? '' the Kid asks . 

`` The Ministry wants us to start again with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones get themselves killed again . '' 

`` But , but , my Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again . '' 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , the stars could change right at any moment , then we all could be shit out of luck . '' Harry tr's going to remind the Guardians of that a lot . He 's still wearing his robes , looking like he 's about to go to some damn Potions lecture . Meanwhile , I used a proven teleportation spell ( as I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` borrow '' '' Secret Team gear from the Austin Police Department . They have nice toys in Texas . 

`` So , what 's our first spell going to be ? '' 

`` Special banishment spell , '' I reply . `` One to cross over dimensional walls . '' <unk> No wizard , even that Potter guy , could singlehandedly slay The Old One . But if enough talented wizards got involved , he might have a chance . Might . 

The Kid did n't need to know about him . 

`` That was a baseline spell I put together to get rid of a few Dementors , '' I continue . `` Did you watch the presentation ? '' 

`` Yes , I did . Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts `` That is an interesting thought running over my head . Hogwarts should really at least mention what a DVD players is to its students . 

`` Okay , we 're going to take that spell and crank it up a few notches . Let 's make sure you 've got the basic idea in your head before we continue . '' 

`` Alright , '' he replies 

`` Remember : right arm fully extended , left arm at the side . Swing it in a controlled motion across your body . '' 

`` I got you , '' he replies. Oh nice , a bit more confident than I like . Damn Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What 's that sounding phrase ? '' 

`` Piercus Four , '' he answers . 

`` Good , let 's see you do it . This kid steps over to the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into the motion , I know it has gone to . He does not put the how arm far enough from his body and he moves way too fast . Before I can yell for him to stop , the fateful words come from his mouth . 

`` Piercus Four ! '' 

The space around him blurs . By keeping his arm close and going too far he redirects the spell at himself . My worst fears are confirmed when the kid stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . So much for the goodwill I received. 

Now I have to go find him .
