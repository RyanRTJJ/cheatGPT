“ Sadie ! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! “ “ her mom frantically dialed 911 , and it did not work. She laid there , shocked . Literally . 

“ Hello ? ! My daughter was struck- “ 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . I pulled my fingers forward , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong , and it was nearby . What was wrong? Why did I take 295 south right now , I can get to there in ten minutes flat . And then I can finally build that house I ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on the right. I can feel it in my blood . Now , I know , they ’ re plum colored and you never wanted black. You say you wanted pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest color out there , and you ’ d be foolish to say otherwise. ” 

My friend looked back at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , the rest of her face read as one emotion : terror . 

“ You know what ? I ’ m gon na get like 500 windows from craigslist , they have the best deals , and make a greenhouse ! ” 

Somehow , the words kept spilling out my mouth . But something else was off here . Something with my house… 

Suddenly I knew . I felt my arms around me as I continued to be filled with rage . I jumped up the rest of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house , where my brother ’ s laptop was . 

“ Not . Home . . I believe. If his computer is plugged in . Well! ! Doesn ’ t he care about anything ? ! He could ’ ve burned the whole place down ! ”
