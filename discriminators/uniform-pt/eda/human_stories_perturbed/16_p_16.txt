The vast hull of the X'tac ship emerged a million miles from the surface of the planet. Captain Hatu sat in his chrome throne in the control room , gazing at the vast planet s beneath them . They 'd sent scouts eons ago and now the time to search for the planet 's bounty had come . He lifted his fingers in an almost absent gesture . His first ear , his second barked out the orders . All around him , subordinates started moving , beginning the assault . Canisters of poison shot out from cannons of lava stones. The canisters had been made to explode upon entry into the atmosphere . The acid would vaporize , but not when it was vaporizing and this time it would rain acid . All there was left to do now was wait and Hatu was patient . 

Hatu was _this_ patient . They had been raining acid on the planet for weeks . Still the planet rotated upon its tilted axis and still the humans did not come toward him. But he expected mercy . He 'd been told kings would beg to give him water and algae . That he could plunder their lands to his fill . Why did the humans not extend succor to him? His human subordinate bowed before him . Hatu waved his hand and his second barked at the subordinate to proceed . 

`` Sir , '' the subordinate said , shaking in fear but admirably keeping his second out of harm's way , `` our attack is failing . We are running low on ammunition . '' 

`` What ! !'' the subordinate roared . There was just the briefest moment of satisfaction when everyone started at the top of his voice . `` How is this possible ? '' Hatu looked down now , too cowed to meet Hatu 's gaze. <unk> Hatu glowered and looked up . `` You will answer my question , scum . '' 

`` Sir , '' the man said , voice barely above a whisper. '' `` the earthlings . . they seem to beâ€¦they appear to be drinking our poison . '' 

`` In fact , many people have been collecting it in large urns , '' another voice piped up somewhere behind him . 

Hatu could feel the eyes of his subordinates , so very wide , looking to him for guidance , but all he could think was , `` If the acid from the orange fruit could not burn the humans , if they could so boldly drink that acid, what use was any other means other than weapons ? ''
