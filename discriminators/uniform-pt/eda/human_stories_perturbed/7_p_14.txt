“ Sadie ! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” 

My mom frantically dialed 911 , as I laid there , weeping. Literally . 

“ Mom ! My daughter was just struck- “ 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . I sat up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . But neither did I care . No . Something was definitely up, and it was nearby . 

“ If I take 295 south right now , I can get to work in ten minutes flat . And, I can finally build that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have the tools for sale . I can feel it in my blood . Now , I know , they ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest of colours out there and you ’ d be a fool ever to say otherwise. ” 

My mom looked back at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the look on the side of her face read as one emotion : terror . 

“ You know what else ? I ’ m going to get like , 50 windows from craigslist , they have the best frames, and make a greenhouse ! ” 

Somehow , the words kept spilling out of my mouth . But something else was off here . Something with my house… 

Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with rage . I jumped out of bed, grabbed my husband and the rest of the team and dashed the ball back to my house , where my brother ’ s laptop was . 

“ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ? And he ’ d care about this house ? ! He could ’ ve burned this whole place down ! ”
