I 'm really not sure I took this job . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with a mix of shame and despair . I got family members who also are pardoned Death Eaters , and they feel the same way . 

I may not be the black sheep of the family , thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters , but I do n't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well , fuck them . I get paid about $8,000/year to sit on a semi inhabited island in Iceland to come up with new spells . 

Why am I near Iceland ? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks . Highly volatile spells come out of my research . The Ministry created a thing about this after they had taken Voldemort down for good . As the son of a bitch - who happens to be my former supervisor <unk> , I was able to get the job pretty easily . I boasted both the pedigree and the skill . 

Also , as my former supervisor said , `` I 'm the crazy son of a bitch . '' 

He 's my former supervisor because one day , working on a teleportation spell , he vanished . His whereabouts are unknown , but there is no doubt that he operated his magic to great success in Vegas , hustling with a black hoodie. 

I always liked that guy . 

Now , I 'm the boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh faced kid out of college who takes everything way too seriously , I worry about his ability to hold up in this line of work . Between the remote location and the dangers of our work , I am ripe to crack up . 

`` So , what are we working on today ? '' the Minister asks . 

`` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with new remedies just in case the Old Ones start rising again '' 

`` But , but , my Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again . '' 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , the stars could be right in our hands right at any moment and we all could be out of luck . '' 

I have to remind the kid of that a lot . He 's still wearing his robes , looking like he 's about to go to some damn Potions lecture <unk> , I used a proven teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team stuff from <unk> the Dallas Police Department . They have nice toys to play with . 

`` So , what 's our first spell going to be ? '' 

`` Special banishment spell , in reply . `` One to cross high walls . '' 

No wizard , not even the current famous Harry Potter guy , could singlehandedly banish an Old One . But if enough talented wizards got involved , the spell might have a chance . Might . 

The Kid did n't need to know that part . 

`` There 's a baseline spell I put together that will get rid of a few Dementors in your family, before I continue . `` Did you watch the presentation ? '' 

`` Yes , I did . Although we never get that strange device at Hogwarts `` 

I shake my head . Hogwarts should really at least mention what a party of elf players is to its students . 

`` Okay , we 're going to basically take that spell and crank it up a little . Let 's make sure you 've got this spell down before we with my '' 

`` Alright , '' he replies 

`` Remember : right arm fully extended , off to the side . Swing it in a controlled motion across your shoulders and elbow. '' 

`` I got you , '' he says , a little more confident than I like when Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What 's the activation phrase ? '' 

`` This '' , '' and <unk> '' . 

`` Good , let 's see you do it . '' 

The kid immediately goes to the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into the motion , I know it has gone to shit . He does n't extend how arm far enough from his side and he moves way too fast . Before I can yell for him to stop , the fateful words explode from his mouth . 

`` <unk> ! '' 

The space around him blurs . By keeping his arm close and going off to the side, he redirects the shot so I can stare at himself . My worst fear is confirmed when that space stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . 

Shit . 

Now I have to go find him .
