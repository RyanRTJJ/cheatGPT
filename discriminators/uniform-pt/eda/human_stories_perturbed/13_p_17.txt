I 'm really not sure why I took this job . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with a mix of shame and fear . I 've got family members who are pardoned Death Eaters , and they feel the same way . 

I may not be the black sheep in the family , thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters , but I do n't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well , fuck them , then get paid decently enough to go to some semi inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new spells . 

Why am I near Iceland ? Because my job is a kind of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks . Highly volatile spells come out of my research . The Ministry created this post more than a decade after they finally put Voldemort down for good. As the like most decorated Aurors , I was able to get the job pretty quickly. My resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill . 

Also , as my former supervisor said , `` I 'm one hell of a bitch . '' 

He 's my former supervisor because one day , working on a teleportation device, but he vanished . His whereabouts, are unknown , but there are rumors that he 's using his magic to great success . He was just a guy , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . 

Now , I 'm the boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh faced kid out of Hogwarts , who takes everything way too seriously . I don 't think he has much faith about his ability to hold up in this line of work . Between the challenges and the dangers of our work , he 's ripe to crack . 

`` So , what are we working on today ? '' the Ministry . 

`` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones rise . '' 

`` But , but , my Defend Against The Dark Arts makes no promise to The Ministry that the Old Ones can never rise again . 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , the stars could change at any moment , then it could be shit e luck . '' 

I have to remind the kid of that a lot . He 's still wearing his robes , looking like he 's about to go to some damn Potions lecture . Meanwhile , I used a proven teleportation spell ( I do n't play with those ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team gear '' from the Dallas Police Department . They have nice toys in their inventory. 

`` So , what 's our first spell going to be ? '' 

`` Special banishment spell , '' I reply . `` One to cross all walls . '' 

No wizard , even that Potter guy , can singlehandedly banish an Old One .'' I say. Perhaps if enough talented wizards got involved , the spell might have a chance . Might . 

The Kid did n't need to know that part . 

`` There 's a baseline spell I put in use to get rid of a few Dementors , '' I continue . <unk> Did you watch the show tonight ? '' 

`` Yes , I did . Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts `` 

I still got it wrong then head . Hogwarts should really at least mention what a DVD players is to its students . Okay , we 're going to basically take that spell and crank it up a few notches . Let 's just make sure you 've got the basic spell down before we continue . 

`` Alright , '' he replies 

`` Remember : hold the pole, fully extended , off to the side . Swing it in a circular motion across your body . '' 

`` I got you , '' he says , a little more confident than I like . Damn Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What 's the activation phrase ? '' 

`` Piercus Four , '' he answers . 

`` Good , let 's see you do it . '' 

The kid steps over to the other side of the room . <unk> As soon as I got into the motion , I know it has gone to another world. He does n't extend how arm far enough from his body and he moves way too much forward . Before I can yell for him to stop , the fateful words come from his mouth . 

`` Piercus Four ! '' 

The space around him blurs . . With his arm close and going too fast he redirects the spell at himself . My worst fears are confirmed once again and as we circle. The space stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . 

Shit . I have to go find him .
