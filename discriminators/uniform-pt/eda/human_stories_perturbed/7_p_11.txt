“ Sadie ! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” 

My mom frantically dialed 911 as I laid there , shocked . Literally . 

“ Hello ? ! I was just struck- “ 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . I sat up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it the changing of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . Nor did I know why . No . Something was definitely wrong , and it was nearby . If I take 295 south right now , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And , when you can finally build that deck you ’ve always wanted , they have the planks on sale . I can feel it in my blood . Now , I know , it will be fun. ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest color out there and you ’ d have to be birch to say otherwise. ” 

My friend smiled back at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : happiness. 

“ You know what else ? I ’ m gon na get like , 50 windows from craigslist , they have the best deals , and a bunch at super reasonable costs ” 

Somehow , the words kept spilling out of my mouth , but just thought something else was off here . Something with my house… 

Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with rage . I jumped up the rest of the way , and dashed the two small men off with my house , and the brother ’ s laptop was . 

“ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . “! He ’ s not home? ! Doesn ’ t he care about this house ? ! He could have just burned the whole place down ! ”
