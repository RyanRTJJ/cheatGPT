My mom frantically dialed 911 , as I laid there , shocked . Literally . 

“ Hello ? ! My daughter was just fine.” 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . I sat up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . The shadows knew they were different, and I care d . Something was definitely wrong , and it was nearby . 

“ If I take 295 for now , I can get to Home Depot in 4 minutes flat . And then I can finally build that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale . I can feel it in my blood .

“ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about this house ? ! I ’ ve almost let the whole place down ! ”
