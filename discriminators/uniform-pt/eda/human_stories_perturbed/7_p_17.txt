“ I just told you to run away ! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” 

My daughter dialed 911 , as I laid there , shocked . Literally . 

“ Oh no ! My daughter was just struck- “ 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . I sat up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Was I dreaming or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . Nor did I care . No . Something was wrong here , and it was worse than I had imagined. 

“ If I take 295 south right now , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And then I can finally build the fireplace you ’ ve wanted , they have them on sale . I can feel it in my blood . Now , I know , they ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out here , pine is the pinest color out there , and it ’ d be a birch to say otherwise. ” 

My mom looked up at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the rest of his face can be read as one emotion : terror . 

“ You know what else ? I ’ m gon na get my hands on 50 windows from craigslist , they have the best deals , and make a greenhouse ! ” 

Somehow , the tears keep spilling out of my mouth . But something was off here . Something with my house… 

Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I jumped up that second hill. It had to be filled with water . I jumped up the rest of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house , where my brother ’ s laptop was . 

“ Not . Home . And the laptop is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about this house ? ! He could have burned the house down ! ”
