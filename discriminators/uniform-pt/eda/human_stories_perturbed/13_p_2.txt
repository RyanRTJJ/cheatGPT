I 'm really not sure why I took this job . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with lots of shame and despair . I 've got family members who are pardoned Death Eaters , and they feel the same way . 

I may not be the black sheep in the family , thanks to the aforementioned Death Knight, but I do see myself asked a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well , fuck them . I get paid decently enough to sit on some semi inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new spells . 

Why am I near the end of this? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks . Highly volatile spells come out of my research . The Ministry created this post about a year after they took Voldemort down for good . As the son of decorated Aurors , I was able to get the job pretty easily . My resume boasted both the pedigree and the talent demanded by an entry-level position. 

Also , as my former supervisor said , '' I 'm one crazy son of a bitch . '' 

He 's my hero because one day , working on a teleportation spell , he has a job. His status and fortune are unknown , but there is word that he 's using his magic to great success in Vegas , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . 

Now , I 'm the boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh faced kid out of the college , who takes everything way too seriously . I worry about his ability to hold up in this line of work . Between the stress of education and the dangers of our work , he 's ripe to crack up . So , what are we working on ? <unk> But What? '' the Kid asks . 

`` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones get the message . '' 

`` But , but , my Defend Against The Devil Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again . '' 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , the stars could be right at any moment , and we all could be in dire need of luck . '' 

I have to remind the kid of that a lot . He 's still wearing his robes , looking like he 's about to go to some damn Potions lecture . Meanwhile , I used a proven teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck around with Potions ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas Police Department of course . They have nice toys in Texas . 

`` So , what 's <unk> my spell going to be ? '' 

`` Special banishment spell , '' I reply . `` One to cross over dimensional walls . '' 

No wizard , even that Potter guy , could singlehandedly banish an Old One . But if other (spare ) wizards got involved , the spell s might have a chance . Might . 

The Kid did n't need to know that part , '' he continues. There 's a baseline spell I put together to get rid of a few Dementors , '' I continue . <unk> Did you watch the presentation ? '' 

`` Yes I did . Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts `` 

I shake my head like no power . Hogwarts should really never mention what a DVD players is to its students . 

`` Okay , we 're going to basically take that spell and crank it up a few notches . Let 's see if you 've got the basic spell down before we continue . '' > Alright , '' he replies 

`` Remember : right arm fully extended , off to your front . Swing it in a controlled motion across your body . '' 

`` I got that, '' he says , a little more confident than I like . Damn Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What 's the activation phrase ? '' 

`` " No" , '' he answers . <unk> Sure , let 's see you do it . '' 

The kid steps over to the other side of the room. <unk> As soon as he goes into the motion , I his back has gone to shit . He does n't extend how arm that he has extended from his head, he moves way too fast . Before I can yell for him to stop , the fateful words come from his mouth . 

`` Piercus Four ! '' 

The space around him blurs . By keeping his arm close and going around the space he redirects the spell at himself . My ideas are confirmed when that space stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . 

Shit . But I actually have to go find him .
