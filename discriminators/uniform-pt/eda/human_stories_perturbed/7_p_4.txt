“ Sadie ! I told you not to fall in as you are standing with the tree in the middle of the lake, sitting. “ “ Dear ! ” 

My mom frantically dialed 911 , as I laid there , shocked . Literally . 

“ Hello ? ! My daughter was just struck- “ All of a sudden , something was wrong . I sat up , my world finally lit up with this new power . Or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . Did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong , and something was bad nearby . 

“ If I take 295 south right now , I can be at Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And then I think build that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale . I can feel it in my blood . Now , I know that ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine , but ” “ spit me out . Plum is the pinest color out there , and you ’ d be a birch to say otherwise. ” 

My mom looked back at me , a hint of worry in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : excited! 

“ You know what else ? I ’ m gon na get like , 50 windows from craigslist , they have the best deals , and make a greenhouse ! !”, laughed Haley , the tears spilling out of my mouth . But something else took place here . Something with my house… 

Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with rage . I jumped up out of the way , and dashed the two blocks with my house , where my brother ’ s laptop was plugged. He is. Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about this house ? ! He could ’ ve burned the whole place down. ”
