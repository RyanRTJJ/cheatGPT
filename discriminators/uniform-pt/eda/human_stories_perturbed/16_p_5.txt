The vast hull of the X'tac ship emerged a million miles from the surface of the earth . <unk>-<unk>. The captain sat in his chrome throne in the large hall , gazing at the blue planet slowly spinning beneath him. They 'd sent scouts eons ago and now the time to reap the rewards of their bounty into the courtyard . He raised his fingers in an almost absent voice. Beside him , his second barked out the orders . All around him , subordinates scurried around , beginning the assault . Clouds of poison shot out from the cannons . The canisters had been made to explode upon entry into the atmosphere . The acid would vaporize , but then , when it rained , it would rain acid . All there was to do now was wait and Hatu was patient . Eor was not _this_ patient . They have been raining acid on the planet for weeks . The planet rotated upon its tilted axis and still the humans did not call out and beg mercy . We’ve been told kings would beg to give him water and algae . That he would then plunder the humans to his fill . Why did the humans not cry for succor ? 

A subordinate bowed low before him . Hatu waved his arm and his second barked at the subordinate to proceed . 

`` Sir , '' the subordinate said , shaking in fear but keeping the tremor out of his voice , `` our attack is failing . We are running low on ammunition . '' Go! Go ! '' Hatu roared . There was just the briefest moment of satisfaction when everyone started at the power of his voice . `` How is this possible ? Another subordinate was now , too cowed to meet Hatu 's eyes . Hatu glowered at him . `` You will answer it , scum . '' 

`` Sir , '' the subordinate s said in a voice barely above a whisper , `` the subordinates replied. They-they appear to be…they appear to be drinking our poison . <unk> In fact , many of them have been collecting it in large urns , '' another voice piped up somewhere behind him . 

Hatu could feel the eyes of his subordinates upon him , looking to him he couldn t understand , but all he could think was , `` If the acid from the orange fruit could not be used by humans , if they could so boldly drink that , what use was any of their flesh but those flowers? ''
