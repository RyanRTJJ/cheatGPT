I 'm really not sure why I took this job . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with a mix of shame and despair . I 've got family members who are retired Butter Eaters , and they feel the same shame and fear . 

I may not be the black sheep of the family , thanks to the aforementioned book , but I do n't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well , maybe later today . I get paid decently enough to sit on some semi inhabited volcanic island in Iceland to come up with new spells . 

Why am I near Iceland ? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks . Highly volatile energy is just like a box of out -dated research . The Ministry created this post about a decade after they finally put Voldemort to bed for good . As the son of decorated Aurors , I was able to land the job pretty easily . My resume boasted both the pedigree and the credentials to be a top executive . 

Also , as my former supervisor wrote , `` I 'm one crazy son of a bitch . '' 

He 's my former supervisor because one day , working on a teleportation spell , he was stolen. His whereabouts are unknown , but there are rumors that he 's using his powers with great success ! Well , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . 

Now , I 'm the boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh faced kid out of Hogwarts , who takes everything way too seriously. I worry about his ability to hold up in this line of work . With the remote location and the dangers of our work environment, I feel it 's ripe to crack up . 

`` So , what are we working on today at the Ministry of the Dark Arts . 

`` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones rise . '' 

`` But , but , my Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise . '' 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , the stars could be right at any moment , then we all could be shit out of here '' 

I have to remind the kid of that a lot . He 's still wearing the leather armband , looking like he 's about to go to some damn Potions lecture . <unk> I used my teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas Police Department . I guess they have nice toys in Texas . 

`` So , what 's our first spell going to be ? '' 

`` Special banishment spell , '' I don't think: '' `` One that can cross over dimensional walls . 

No wizard , even that Potter guy , could singlehandedly banish an Old One . But if enough talented wizards got involved , the spell might have a chance . Might . 

The Kid did n't need to know that part . 

`` There 's a baseline spell I put together to get rid of your last few Dementors , '' I continue . <unk> Did you watch the Guardian in Dark Shadows? '' 

`` Yes , I did . Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts `` 

I shake my head . Hogwarts should really at least mention what a DVD players is to its students . 

`` Okay , we 're going to take that <unk> and crank it up a few notches . Let 's make sure you 've got the basic spell down before we continue . '' 

`` Alright , '' he replies and lets you know : right arm fully extended , off to the side . Swing it in a controlled motion across your body . '' 

`` I got you , '' he says , a little further than I like . Damn Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What 's the matter ? '' 

`` Piercus Four , '' he answers . <unk> Peter , let 's see you do it . '' 

The kid steps over to the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into the motion , I know it has gone to shit . He does n't extend how arm far enough from my face, and he moves way too fast . Before I can yell for him to stop , the fateful words come from under my brow . 

`` Piercus : '' 

The space around him blurs . By keeping his arm close and going too fast I would not make him have the spell at himself . My worst fears are confirmed when that space stabilizes . He is a 

Shit . 

Now I have to go find him .
