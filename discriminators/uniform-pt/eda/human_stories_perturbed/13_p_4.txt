I 'm really not sure why I took this path? I have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with a mix of shame and despair . I also have family members who are pardoned Death Eaters , and they feel the same way . 

I may not be the black sheep of the family , thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters , but I still get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well , fuck them . I get bored often enough to sit on some semi inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new spells . 

Why am I near Iceland ? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at someone to see what sticks . Highly volatile spells come out of nowhere . The Ministry created this post about a decade after they finally put Voldemort down for good . As the son of decorated Aurors , I 'd be able to get the job pretty easily . My resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill . 

Also , as my supervisor said , `` I was just the crazy son of a bitch . '' 

He 's my former supervisor because one day , to a teleportation machine, he vanished . His whereabouts are unknown , but there are rumors that he was able to work his magic to great success in Vegas , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . 

Now , I 'm the boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh faced kid from Hogwarts , who takes everything way too seriously . I worry about his ability to hold up in this line of work . Between the remote location and the dangers of our work , he 's ripe to crack up . 

`` So , what are we working on today ? '' the Kid asks . 

`` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones rise . '' 

`` But , anyway , my Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again . '' 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , the stars could be right at any time and then we all could be shit out of luck . '' 

I have to remind the kid of that one . He 's still wearing his robes , looking like he wants to go to some damn Potions lecture . Meanwhile , I got my proven teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team gear from the Houston Police Department . They have nice toys in Texas . 

`` So ... what 's our first spell going to be ? '' 

`` Special banishment spell , '' I reply . `` One to cross over , '' I say . '' 

No wizard , even that Potter guy , could singlehandedly banish an Old One . But if enough talented wizards are involved , the Old One might have a chance . Might . 

The Kid did n't need to know that part . 

`` There 's a baseline spell I put together to get rid of a curse , '' I continue . <unk> Did you watch the presentation ? '' 

`` Yes , I did . Although we never used that one at Hogwarts `` 

I shake my head . Hogwarts should really at least mention what a DVD players is to their students . 

`` Okay , we 're going to take that and crank it up a few notches . Let 's make sure you 've got the basic spell down before we continue . '' 

`` Alright , '' he replies 

`` Remember : right arm fully extended , off to the side . Swing it in a controlled motion across your body . '' 

`` I got you , '' he says , a thousand times too confident than I like . Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What 's the activation phrase ? '' 

`` Piercus Four , '' he answers . <unk> Piercus Four , let 's see you do it . '' He steps over to the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into the motion , I know it has gone to shit . He does n't extend how arm far enough from his body and he moves way too fast . Before I can yell for him to stop , the words come out of his mouth . 

`` Piercus Four ! The space around him blurs . By keeping his arm close and his breath fast he redirects the spell at himself . My worst fears are confirmed when that space stabilizes . The spell is gone . Heâ€™s taken us. 

Now I have to go find him .
