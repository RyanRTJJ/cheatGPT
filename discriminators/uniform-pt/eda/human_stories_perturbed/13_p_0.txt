I 'm not sure why I took this . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with a mix of shame and fear . I 've got family members who are pardoned Death Eaters , and they feel the same way . 

I may not be the black sheep of the family , thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters , but I do n't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well , that makes me happy . I get paid decently to sit on some semi inhabited island around Australia and come up with new spells . 

Why am I not in Iceland ? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at a wall to see what sticks . Highly volatile spells come out of my research . The Ministry created this post about a decade after they finally put Voldemort down for good for his deed against the son of decorated Aurors , I was able to get the job pretty easily . My resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill of an American. But , as my former supervisor said , `` I 'm the son of a bitch . That 's my former supervisor because one day , working on a teleportation spell , he vanished . His whereabouts are not known, but there are rumors that he 's using his magic to great success in Vegas , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . 

Now I 'm the boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh faced kid out of Hogwarts , who takes everything way too seriously . I worry about him's ability to hold up in this line of work . Between the remote location and the dangers of our work , he 's ripe to crack up . Anyway , what are we working on today ? '' the Kid asks . 

`` The Ministry is preparing to start coming up with new solutions just in case the Old Ones rise . '' 

`` But , but The Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again . '' 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , the stars could be right at any moment , then we all could be shit out of home . I have to remind the boy that a lot . He 's still wearing his robes , looking like he 's about to go to some damn Potions lecture . Meanwhile , I used a good ol' - class spell ( I just fuck around with those ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas Police Department . They're pretty nice toys in Texas . 

`` So , what 's our first spell going to be ? '' 

`` Special banishment spell , '' I reply . `` One to cross over dimensional walls . '' 

No wizard , even that Potter guy , could singlehandedly banish an Old One . But if enough talented wizards got together, the spell might have a chance . . 

The Kid dish, '' I need to know that part . 

`` There 's a baseline spell I put together to get rid of a few Dementors , '' I continue . `` Did you watch the presentation ? '' Yes , I did . Although we also used that strange device at Hogwarts `` 

I shake my head . Hogwarts should really at least mention what a DVD players is to its students . 

`` Okay , so we're going to basically take that spell and crank it up a bit . Let 's make sure you 've got the basic spell s figured out before we continue . '' <unk> Alright , '' he replies 

`` Remember : right arm stayed behind me , off to the side . Swing it in a controlled motion across the space . '' 

`` I got you , '' he says , a little more confident than I like . Damn Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What 's the activation phrase ? 

`` Piercus Four , '' he answers . 

`` Good , let 's see you do it . '' 

The kid steps over to the other side of the room and runs out of the room. As soon as he goes into the motion , I know it has gone to shit . He does n't have an arm far enough from his body and he moves way too fast . Before I can yell for him to stop , the fateful words come from him. '' "Oh crap . 

`` Piercus Four ! '' 

The space around him blurs . By keeping his arm close and going too fast he threw a spell at himself and his worst fears are confirmed when that space stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . 

Shit . I have to go find him .
