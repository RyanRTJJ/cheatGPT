I 'm really not sure why I took this job . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with a mix of shame and despair . I have family members who are pardoned Death Eaters . Again they feel the same way . 

I may not be the black sheep of the family , thanks to The Death Eaters , but I do n't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . But I have family , fuck them . I get paid decently enough to sit on some semi inhabited island around Iceland to rehearse with new spells . 

Why am I near Iceland ? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing money at the wall and seeing what sticks . Highly volatile spells come out of my research . The Ministry created this post about a decade after they finally put Iceland on the map for good . As the son of decorated Aurors , I was able to get the job pretty easily . My resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill . But as my supervisor said , I 'm one crazy son of a bitch . '' 

He 's my former supervisor because one day , working on a teleportation spell , he vanished . His whereabouts are unknown , but there are rumors that he 's still operating. I tried my magic to great success in Vegas , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked to help people . 

Now , I 'm the boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh faced with the Head of Hogwarts , who takes everything way too seriously . I worry about his ability to hold up to this line of work . Between the remote location and the dangers of our work , he 's ripe to crack up . The question we can 't remember is , what are we working on today ? '' <unk> Why, the Kid asks . 

`` The Ministry of Death has to start coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones rise . '' 

`` But , but , my Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again . '' 

`` You no doubt it isn 't our fault at Hogwarts anymore , the stars could be right at any moment , then we all could be shit out of luck . I have to remind a certain kid of that a lot . He 's still wearing his robes , looking like he 's about to go to some damn Potions lecture . Meanwhile , I used my teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team gear from the Texas Law Enforcement Department . They have nice toys in Texas . 

`` So , what 's our plan, going to be ? '' 

`` A spell , '' I reply . `` One to cross over dimensional walls . '' 

No one, not even that Potter guy , could singlehandedly banish an Old One '' if enough talented wizards got involved , the spell might have a chance . Might . 

The Kid did n't need to know that part . <unk> No, there 's a baseline spell I put together to get rid of a certain spell , '' I continue . `` Did you watch the presentation ? '' 

`` Yes , I did . Although we never used that strange trick by Hogwarts `` 

I shake my head and decide that I should really at least mention what a DVD players is to you . 

`` Okay , we are going to basically take that spell and crank it up a few notches . Let 's make sure you 've got the basic spell down before we continue . '' 

`` Alright , '' he replies 

`` Remember : right arm fully extended , off to the side , your left shoulder in place, let it do its controlled motion across your body . '' 

`` I got it, '' he says , a little more confident than I like . Damn Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What 's the name of this kid ? '' 

`` Piercus Four , '' he answers . 

`` Good , let 's see you do it . '' 

The kid steps over to the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into the room. <unk> Hey , I know it has gone to shit . He does n't extend how arm far enough from my body and he moves way too fast . Before I can yell for him to stop , the fateful words come from inside me . 

`` Piercus Four ! '' 

The space around him blurs . By keeping his arm close to me when it moves too fast he redirects the spell at himself . My worst fears are confirmed when that space stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . I was not able to kill him at this point . 

Now I have to go find him .
