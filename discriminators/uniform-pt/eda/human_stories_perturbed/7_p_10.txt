Hi ! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” 

My mom frantically dialed 911 , my daughter laid there , shocked . She yelled to me, 

“ Hello ? ! My daughter was just struck- “ 

All of a sudden , something was wrong with my body? I sat up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . “ Maybe. was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong , and a stranger was nearby . 

“ If I take 295 south right now . You can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And then I can finally build that home I ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale . I ’ ve got it in my blood .

Plum is the pinest color out there , and you ’ d be insane to say otherwise. My mom looked back at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the rest of the words could only be read as one emotion : terror . 

“ You know what else ? I ’ m gon na m t buy a cheap greenhouse , 50 windows from craigslist , they have great deals , and make a greenhouse ! ” 

Somehow , the words kept spilling out of my mouth . But something else was not right here . Something with my house… 

Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I began to be filled with rage . I jumped up , pushed him out of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house , where my brother ’ s laptop was . 

“ Not . Home . And his computer is in my bedroom. . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about this house ? ! He could have burned the whole place down ”
