I 'm really not sure why I took this job . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with a mix of shame and despair . I 've got friends who are pardoned Death Eaters , and they feel the same way . What a feeling it may not be the black sheep of the family , thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters , but I do n't get a lot of questions about dinners . 

Oh well , but anyway . I get paid decently enough to sit on some semi inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new spells . 

Why am I writing this near Iceland ? Because my readings are the equivalent of throwing shit at broomsticks to see what sticks . Highly volatile spells come out of my research . The Ministry created this post about a decade after they finally put Voldemort down for good . As the son of decorated Aurors , I managed to get the job pretty easily and my resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill . 

Also , my former supervisor said , `` I 'm one crazy son of a bitch . '' 

He 's my former supervisor because one day , working on a teleportation spell has vanished . His whereabouts are unknown , but there are rumors that he 's using his spell to great success in Vegas , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . 

Now , I have an old boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh faced kid out of Hogwarts , who takes everything very seriously . But I worry about his ability to be in this line of work . Between the remote location and the dangers of our work , he 's ripe to crack up . 

`` So , what are we working on today ? '' the old professor said . 

`` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones rise . '' 

`` But , but , my Defend Against , Advancing Against Fine Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again . '' 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , the Lord's thoughts could all go off, and if they happen to be right at any minute then we all could be shit out of luck . '' 

I have to remind the kid of this a lot . He 's still wearing his robes , looking like he 's about to go to some damn 'em . Meanwhile , I used a proven teleportation spell ( I do n't ever mess with those ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas SWAT team . They have nice toys in Texas . 

`` So , what 's our first spell going to be ? '' 

`` Special banishment spell , '' his friend reply . <unk> To allow that Old One to cross over dimensional walls . '' 

No wizard , even that Potter guy , could singlehandedly banish an Old One . But if enough talented wizards got involved , the Old One might have a chance . Might . 

The Kid did n't really know that part . 

`` There 's a baseline spell like this which was put together to get rid of a few Dementors , '' I continue . `` Did you watch the film, '' 

`` Yes , I did . Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts `` 

I shake my head and think that Hogwarts should really at least mention what a DVD players is to its students . 

`` Okay , we 're going to basically take that spell and crank it up a few notches . Let 's make sure you 've got the magic down before we continue . '' 

`` Alright , then.'' he replies 

`` Remember : right arm fully extended , off to the side . Swing back and forth in a controlled motion across your body . '' 

`` Got you , '' he says , a little more confident than I like . Damn Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What ! Is that the activation phrase ? '' 

`` Piercus Four , '' he answers . 

`` Now let 's see you do it . '' 

The n I came over to the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into the motion , I know it has gone to shit . I could n't extend how arm far enough from his body and he moves way too fast . Before I can yell for him to stop , the fateful words come from his mouth. I am almost certain he means the word shit 

`` Piercus Four o and that shit is my destiny. 

The space around him blurs . By keeping his arm close and going back to his place, he redirects the spell at himself . My worst fears are confirmed when that space stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . 

Shit . I have to go find him .
