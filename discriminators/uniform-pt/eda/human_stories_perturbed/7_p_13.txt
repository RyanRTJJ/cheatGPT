“ I knew something was wrong, as I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm . 

My mom frantically dialed 911 , as I laid there , shocked . Literally . 

“ Hello ? ! My daughter was just playing with her sister. 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . I touched my hands up , my fingertips crackling with electric power . Or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t remember . Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong , and it was nearby . 

“ If I take 295 south right now , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And then I can bring that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale . I can feel it in the blood . Now you know , they ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest color out there , and you ’ d be a fool not to say it. 

My mom looked back at me , a hint of me in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : terror . 

“ You know what else ? I ’ m going to get like 100 glazed windows from my fao, they have the best deals , and make a greenhouse ! ” 

Somehow , the words kept spilling out of my mouth . But something else was off here . Something with my house… 

Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I continued , I was filled with rage . I jumped up the rest of the way and dashed the door to my house ? But my brother ’ s laptop was . 

“ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about how hot he is ? It could ’ ve burned the whole place down ! ”
