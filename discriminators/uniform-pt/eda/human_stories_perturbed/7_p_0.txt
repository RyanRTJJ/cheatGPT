“ Wait, I told you not to stand in a tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” 

My mom frantically dialed 911 as I laid there , shocked . Literally . 

“ Hello ? ! My daughter was just struck- “ 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . I sat up , my fingertips filled with this new power . Or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . Nor did I care. No . Something was definitely wrong , and it was not easy. I said : 

“ If I take 295 south right and I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And then I can finally build that deck you ’ ve wanted for years. And they have the planks on sale . I can feel it in my blood . Now , I only pray they ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest color out there and it d be a birch to say otherwise. ” 

My mom looked back at me , a hint of desperation in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : terror . 

“ You know what else ? I ’ m gon na get a window, maybe 50 windows from craigslist , they have the best deals , and make a greenhouse ! ” she said, the words kept spilling inside my mouth . But I was off here . Something with my house… 

Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with rage . I jumped the rest of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house , where my brother could not find where his laptop was . 

“ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about it ? That little laptop and I could ’ ve could ’ ve burned the whole place down ! ”
