“ Sadie ! I am not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” 

My mom frantically dialed 911 while I laid there , shocked . Literally . 

“ Hello ? ! My daughter was just playing on my phone.” 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . I sat up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it in the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong, and it was nearby . What to do? And why should I take 295 south right now , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes . And then I hear, build that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale . I can feel it in my blood . Now , I know , they ’ re plum colored and you did say you were , but hear me out here . Purple is the pinest color out there , and you ’ d be a birch to say otherwise. ” 

My mom looked back at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : terror . 

“ You know what else ? I ’ ll na get like , 50 windows from craigslist , they have the best deals , and make them movable ! ” 

Somehow , the words kept spilling out of my mouth . But something else was off here . Something in my house… 

Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with it. I knew it the rest of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house , where my brother ’ s laptop was . 

“ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged up! ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about this house ? He could ’ ve burned the whole place down ! ”
