I 'm really not sure why I took this job . I already have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with a mix of shame and despair . I 've also known family members who are pardoned Death Eaters . I hope they feel the same way . 

I may not be . I are the black sheep of the family , thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters , but I do n't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well , fuck them . I get paid decently enough to sit on some semi inhabited Icelandic island in Iceland to come up with new spells . 

Why am I near the gods? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks . Most spells come out of my research . The Ministry created this post about a decade after they finally put Voldemort down for good . As the son of decorated Aurors , I was able to land the job pretty easily . My resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill . 

Also , as my former supervisor said , `` I 'm one crazy son of a bitch . '' 

He 's my former supervisor , still laughing to this day , working on a teleportation spell , he vanished . His whereabouts are unknown , but there are rumors that he 's using his magic to hang out in Vegas , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . 

Now , I 'm the person I have to recruit . Fresh faced kid out of Hogwarts , who takes himself way too seriously . I worry about his ability to hold up in this twisted world of my work . Between the remote location and the dangers of our work , he 's ripe to crack up . 

`` a<unk> So what are we working on today ? '' the Kid asks . 

`` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones rise . '' 

`` But , but , my dear, The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can 't rise again . '' 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore . The stars could be right at any moment , then we all feel like we're god shit out of luck . '' 

I have to remind the kid of that a lot . He 's still wearing his robes , looking like he 's about to go to some damn Potions lecture . So I use a proven teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas Police Department . They have nice toys in Texas . 

`` So , what 's our first spell going to be . 

`` Special banishment spell , '' I reply . `` One to cross over dimensional walls . '' 

No wizard, even that Potter guy , could singlehandedly banish an Old One . But if enough talented wizards got involved, the spell might have a chance . Might . 

The Kid did n't need to know that , do they? 

`` There 's a baseline we put together to get rid of a few Dementors , '' I continue . `` Did you watch the presentation ? '' 

`` Yes , I did , but we never used that strange device at Hogwarts `` 

I shake my head . Hogwarts should really at least mention what it is that players is to its students . 

`` Okay , we 're going to basically take that spell and crank it up a few levels. <unk> Let 's make sure we've got the basic spell down before we continue . '' 

`` Alright , '' he replies 

`` Remember : right arm fully extended , off to the side . Swing it in a controlled motion across your body . '' 

`` I got it, '' he says, a little more confident which I like . Damn Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What 's the activation phrase ? '' 

`` Piercus Four , '' he whispered. 

`` Good , let 's see you do it . '' , Piercus Four then steps over to the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into it , I know it . He jumped to shit . He does n't extend how arm far enough outside his body and he moves way too fast . Before I can yell for him to stop the fateful words come from his mouth . 

`` Piercus Four ! '' 

The space around him blurs . By keeping his arm close and going too far back redirects the spell at himself . My worst fears are confirmed when that space stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . 

Shit . I have to find him .
