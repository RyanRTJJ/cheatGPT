I 'm really not sure why I took this job . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with a sigh of shame and despair . I 've got family members who are pardoned Death Eaters , and they feel the same way . 

I may not be the black sheep of the family. Firstly thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters , I do n't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well , fuck them . You get paid decently enough to sit on some semi inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new spells . Why am I near Iceland ? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks . Highly volatile spells come out of my research . The Ministry of Justice is still struggling to fill an empty post about a decade after they finally shut it down for good . As the son of decorated Aurors , I was able to get the job pretty easily . My resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill . But, as my former supervisor said , `` I 'm one crazy son of a bitch . '' 

He 's my former supervisor because one day , working on a teleportation spell and has since vanished . His whereabouts are unknown but there are rumors that he 's continuing to use black magic to great success in Vegas , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . 

Now , I 'm the boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh kid out of Hogwarts , who takes everything way too seriously. I worry about his ability to hold up in this line of work . With the remote location and the dangers of our work , he 's ripe to crack up . 

`` So , what are we working on today ? '' the Kid replied. '' 

`` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones rise . '' 

`` But , but , my Defend ant, the Great Dark Arts Professor said , the Old Ones can never rise again . '' 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , then they could go at any moment , then we all could be shit out of luck , 

I have to remind the kid of that a lot . He 's still wearing his robes , looking like he 's about to go to some damn Potions lecture . . <unk> I just use my proven teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas Police Department . They have nice toys in Texas . 

`` So , what it first spell going to be ? '' 

`` Special banishment spell , '' I reply . `` One to the other dimensional walls . 

No wizard , even that Potter guy , could singlehandedly banish an Old One . But if enough talented wizards were involved , the spell might have a chance . Might . 

The Kid did n't s' know that part . 

`` There 's a baseline spell I put together to get rid of a few Dementors , he said from the continue . `` Did you watch the presentation ? '' 

`` Yes I did . Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts `` 

I shake my head, Hogwarts should really at least mention what a DVD players is to me . 

`` Okay , we 're going to basically take the wizard's spell and crank it up a few notches . Let 's make sure you 've got the basic spell down before we continue . '' 

`` Alright , '' he replies 

`` Remember : right arm fully extended , off to the side . Swing it in a controlled straight line around your body . And thatâ€™s it. '' 

`` I got you , '' he says , a little more confident than I like . You are always like to know about it. 

`` What 's the activation phrase ? '' 

`` Piercus is correct '' he answers . 

`` Good , let 's go do it . '' 

The kid steps over to the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into the motion , I know it has gone to shit . He does n't extend how arm far enough from his body and he moves way too fast. Before I can yell for him to stop, the fateful words come from his mouth . 

`` <unk> ! '' 

The space around him blurs . keeping his arm close and going too fast he reaches in to spell at himself . My worst fears are confirmed when that space stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . No one wants it. No way . 

Now I have to go find him .
