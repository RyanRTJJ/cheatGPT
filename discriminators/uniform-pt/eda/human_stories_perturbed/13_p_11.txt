I 'm really not sure why I took this job . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with a sort of shame and despair . I 've got family members who are pardoned Death Eaters , and they feel the same way . That may not be the black and white movie to the family , thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters , but I do n't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well , that's only about them . I get paid decently enough to sit on some semi inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new spells . 

Why am I near Iceland ? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks . Highly volatile spells are the stuff of my work. The Ministry created this post about a year after they finally put Voldemort down for good . As the son of decorated Aurors , I was able to get the job pretty easily . My resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill . 

Also , as my former supervisor said , I 'm one crazy son of a bitch . '' 

He 's my guy, '' because one day , working on his teleportation spell , he vanished . His origins are unknown , but there are rumors that he 's using his magic to great success in Vegas , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . But now , I 'm the boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh faced kid out there , who takes work too seriously . I worry about his ability to hold up in this line of work . <unk>. Considering our very remote location and the dangers of our work , he 's ripe to crack up . 

`` So , what are we working on today ? '' the Kid asks . 

`` The Ministry wants us to worry about coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones rise . '' 

`` Yes but the Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again . '' 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , but if what you did last year could be right at any moment , then we could be shit out of luck . '' 

I have to remind the kid of that .'' I say. . He 's still wearing his robes , looking like he 's about to go to some damn Potions lecture . Meanwhile , I used a proven teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas Police Department . They have them in their arsenal of powers 

`` So , what 's our first spell going to be ? '' 

`` Special banishment spell , '' I reply . `` One to cross over dimensional walls . '' 

No wizard , even a skilled guy , could singlehandedly banish an adversary . But if enough talented wizards got involved , then your spell might have a chance . Might . 

The Kid did n't need to know about them . 

`` There 's a spell I put together to get rid of a few Dementors , '' I continue . `` Did you watch the presentation ? '' 

`` Yes , '' he said . Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts `` 

I shake my head . Hogwarts should at least mention what a DVD players is before admitting anyone, even university students . 

`` Okay , we 're going to basically take that spell and crank it up a few notches . Let 's make sure you 've got the basic spell down before we continue . '' 

`` Alright , '' he replies 

`` Remember : right arm fully extended , off to the side . Swing it in a controlled motion across your body . '' 

`` I got you , '' he says , a little more confident now, like the Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What 's the activation phrase ? '' 

`` Piercus Four , '' he answers . 

`` Good , then I'll see you later . '' 

The kid steps over to the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into the room, <unk> I boy has gone to shit . He does n't extend how arm far enough from his body and he moves way too fast . Before I can yell for him to stop , the fateful words come from his mouth 

`` Piercus Four on <unk> 

The space around him blurs . By keeping his arm close and going forward he redirects the spell at himself . My theories are confirmed when my hand stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . 

Shit . 

Now I have to go find him .
