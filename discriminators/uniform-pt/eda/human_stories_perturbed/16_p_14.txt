The vast hull of the Starship ship emerged a million miles from the surface of the earth . Hatu sat on a chrome throne in the control room , watching at the blue planet slowly spinning beneath them . They 'd sent scouts eons ago and now the time to reap the rewards of their bounty ” . He lifted his fingers in an almost absent gesture . Beside him , his subordinates called out the orders . All around him , subordinates scurried around , trying to avoid the assault . Canisters of poison shot out from the cannons . The canisters had been designed to explode upon entry into the atmosphere . The acid would vaporize , but then , when it rained , they would rain acid and there would remain a layer of that.

`` Sir , '' Hatu said , barely above a whisper , `` I just...I just have to stop . They-they appear to be…they appear to be drinking our poison . '' 

`` In fact , many people have been collecting it in large urns , '' another voice piped up somewhere behind him . 

Hatu could feel the eyes of his subordinates upon him , looking to him for guidance , but all he could think was ... If the acid from the fruit could not burn the humans , if they could so boldly drink that , what use was any of their weapons ?.. [?.] •... »
