“ I think I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” I frantically dialed 911 , as I laid there there in terror . Literally . 

“ Hello ? ! My daughter was just struck- “ 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . I sat up slowly, my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t remember. Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong , and it was nearby . 

“ If I take 295 south right now , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat and then I can finally build that new house I ’ ve wanted , they have the planks I want. I feel that . I can feel it in my blood . Now , I know , they ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say that ” this is pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest color out there , and you ’ d be a fool to say otherwise. ” 

My mom looked back at me , a hint of glee in her eyes , but the rest of the words read as one emotion : terror . 

“ You know what else ? I ’ m gon na get like , 50 windows from craigslist , the craigslist that has the best deals , and make a mess of them ! ” 

Somehow , the words kept spilling out of my mouth . But something else was off here . Something was broken in the house… 

Suddenly , I knew . I could feel my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with rage . I jumped up the rest of my steps , and dashed the two blocks to my house , where my brother ’ s laptop was . 

“ Not . “ And his computer was in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about this house ? ! He could ’ ve burned this whole place down ! ”
