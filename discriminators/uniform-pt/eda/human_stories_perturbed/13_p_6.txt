I 'm really not sure why I took this job . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They feel me with a mix of shame and despair . I 've got family members that are pardoned Death Eaters , and they feel the same way . 

I may not be the black sheep of the family , thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters , but I do get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . 

Oh well , we all know a few of them . I get paid decently enough to sit on every inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new spells . 

Why am I near a god? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall and see what sticks . Highly volatile spells come out of my research . The Ministry created this list a decade after they finally put Voldemort down for good . As the son of m af , I was able to get the job pretty easily . My resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill . 

Also , as my former supervisor said , `` I 'm one crazy son of m af . '' 

He 's my former supervisor because one day , was allegedly working a teleportation spell , he vanished . His whereabouts are unknown , but there are rumors that he had used his magic to great success in Vegas , hustling blackjack . 

I always liked that guy . 

Now , I 'm the boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh faced new Chancellor of Hogwarts , who takes everything way too seriously . I worry about his ability to hold up in the current line of work . Between the remote location and the dangers of that line of work , he 's ripe to crack up . 

`` So , what are we working on today ? '' the Minister wrote . 

`` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones rise . '' 

`` But , then, my Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again . '' 

`` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , the stars could be right at any moment , then we all could be shit out of luck . '' 

I have to remind the kid of that a lot . He 's still in his robes , looking pretty, but he 's forced to go to some damn Potions lecture . Meanwhile , we have a proven teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas SWAT Team . They have the best guys in Texas . 

`` So , what 's our first spell going to be ? '' 

`` One spell , '' I reply . `` One to cross over dimensional walls . '' 

No wizard , even that Potter guy , could singlehandedly banish an Old One . But if enough talented wizards got involved , the Old One might have a chance . <unk> 

The But you do n't need to know that part . 

`` There 's a baseline spell I put together to get rid of a few Dementors , '' I continue . `` Did you not know that part of the presentation ? '' 

`` Yes , I did . Although , before that I had used that strange device at Hogwarts `` 

I shake my head . Hogwarts should really at least realise what a DVD players is to its students . 

`` Well we 're going to basically take this spell and crank it up a few notches . Let 's make sure you 've got the basic spell down before we continue . '' 

`` Alright , '' he replies 

`` Remember : Hand fully extended , off to the side . Swing it in a controlled way around your body . '' 

`` I got you , '' he says <unk> A little more confident than I like . Damn Gryffindors are always like that . 

`` What 's the activation phrase ? '' 

`` Piercus Four , '' he says. 

`` Good , let 's see what's it . '' 

The kid steps forward, he moves to the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into the motion , I know it has gone wrong . He does n't extend how arm far enough from his body and he moves way too fast . Before I can yell him to stop , the fateful words come from his mouth . 

`` Piercus Four ! '' 

The line in front of him blurs . By keeping his arm close and going too fast to break the spell at himself . Almost as though his worst fears are confirmed when his head stabilizes . 

The Kid is gone . 

Shit . 

Now I have to go find him .
