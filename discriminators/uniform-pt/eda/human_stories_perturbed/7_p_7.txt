“ Sadie ! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” 

My mom frantically dialed 911 , as I stood there , shocked . Literally . 

“ Hello ? ! My mother! Lightning just struck- “ 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . I sat up , my lungs flooded with this new power . Or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell. Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong , and it was not happening to me. 

“ If I take 295 south right now , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And then I can finally build that deck i ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale so I can feel it in my blood . Now I know , they ’ re plum , you did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest sort of plant out there , I’ m sorry ’ d be a birch to say otherwise. ” 

My mom looked back at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : terror . 

“ You know what , I ’ m gon na get like that, get double hung glass windows from craigslist , they have the best deals , and make a greenhouse ” 

Somehow , the words kept spilling out of my mouth . But something else was off here . Something with my house… 

Suddenly I knew . Now I was back down the street. Anger kept my blood boiling as I continued , filled with rage . I jumped up the rest of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house , where my brother ’ s laptop was . 

“ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about this ? ! You ’ ve burned the whole place down already! ”
