“ Sadie ! I told you not to stand under a tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” My phone frantically dialed 911 , as I laid there , shocked . Literally . 

“ Help ! My daughter was just struck- “ 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . I could only feel a vibration , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it the aftermath of a terrible storm threatening lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong , and it hurt . 

“ If I take 295 . Right now , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And you can finally build that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale . I can feel it in my blood . Now , I know , they ’ re plum colored pine. You did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest color out there , and you don’t want it to be a birch , pine or otherwise. ” 

My mom looked back at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the look on her face read as one emotion : terror . You know what else ? I ’ m gon na get like , 50 windows from craigslist , they have the best deals , and make a greenhouse ! ” In her mouth the words kept spilling out of my mouth . Something else was off here . Something with my house… 

Suddenly , I was not the only one. I felt my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with rage . I jumped the rest of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house , where my father ’ s laptop was . 

“ Not . Home . And the AC is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t this computer tech care about this house ? ! He could ’ ve burned the whole place down ! ”
