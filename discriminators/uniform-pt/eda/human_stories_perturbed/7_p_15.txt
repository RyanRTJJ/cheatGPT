“ Hello?” “ Hello? ! I told you I would stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” For my husband, who had just frantically dialed 911 , as I laid there , shocked . Literally . 

“ Hello ? ! My daughter was just struck- “ 

All of a sudden , something was wrong . I sat up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it the energy of the wind? I couldn ’ t tell . Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong. Something had broken and it was nearby . 

“ If I take 295 south right now , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes . And then I can get you on that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale . I can feel it in my blood . I know , I know , they ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest color out there , and it d be a birch to say otherwise. ” 

My mom looked back at me with a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion blotting onto the other . 

“ You know what else ? I ’ m gonna get like , 50 windows from craigslist , they are the best deals , and make a greenhouse ! ” 

Somehow , the words kept spilling out of my mouth . But something else was off here . Something with my house… 

Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with dread . I retreated inside the rest of the way , and dashed the other way to my house .” When we left my brother ’ s house he was . 

“ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about this house ? ! He could ’ ve burned the whole place down ! ”
