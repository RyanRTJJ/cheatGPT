The vast hull of the X'tac ship emerged a million miles from the surface of the earth . The captain sat in his chrome robes in the control room , gazing at the endless sea of blue sky and the spinning planet slowly spinning beneath them . They 'd sent scouts eons ago and now the time to reap the planet 's bounty had come . He lifted his fingers , an almost absent gesture . Beside him , his second barked out . He had been attacked . Behind him , subordinates scurried around , preparing for the assault . Canisters of poison shot out from the cannons . The canisters had been made to explode upon entry into the atmosphere . The acid would vaporize , but then , the moment it did it would rain acid . All there was left to do now was wait and Hatu was patient . 

Hatu was not _this_ patient . They 'd been raining acid on him for weeks before the planet rotated upon its tilted axis and still the humans did not come and clamber in . He 'd been told kings would beg to see him with water and algae . He could plunder their lands to his fill . How could the humans not cry for succor ? 

A subordinate bowed low before him . Hatu waved his hand and his scabbard at the subordinate to proceed . 

`` Sir , '' the subordinate said , shaking in fear but admirably keeping the tremor out of his face , `` our attack will be too late . We are running low on ammunition . '' 

`` What ! '' the subordinate said . There was just the briefest spark of satisfaction when everyone heard the power of his voice . `` How is this possible ? '' 

The subordinate seemed tense now , too cowed to meet Hatu 's eyes . Hatu glowered at him . <unk> You will answer my question , scum . '' 

`` Sir , '' the voice inside, the deep , voice barely above his , `` the earthlings . They-they appear to be…they appear to be collecting poison . '' 

`` In fact , many people have been collecting it in -out of the wormhole, and eating it, as well , '' another voice piped up somewhere behind him . 

Hatu could feel the eyes of his beloved sat next to him , looking to him for guidance , but all he could think was , `` If the acid from the orange fruit could not burn the humans , if they could so boldly drink that , what use was any of our weapons ?».<unk>?
