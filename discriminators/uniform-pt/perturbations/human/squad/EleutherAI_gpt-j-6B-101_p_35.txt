; Beroea also sent expensive presents, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold or silver "from his charges" but Liberius refused them, not expecting that he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not in the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Then he sent for some a strict guard to guard them. But, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally accused of any crime. The emperor was unwilling to give him silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years in exile returned to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his subjects, and ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that they should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and admitted to no statement or creed which had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner established his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Liturgy lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor believed what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the behest of his brother, Constans.
