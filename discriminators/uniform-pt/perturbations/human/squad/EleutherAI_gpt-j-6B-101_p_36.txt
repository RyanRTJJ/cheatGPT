; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if they might induce Liberius to accept the Arian position but were refused. This time he sent to him, indeed, five hundred pieces of silver and three of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of Italy; and these words were made up on consideration of the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out.
