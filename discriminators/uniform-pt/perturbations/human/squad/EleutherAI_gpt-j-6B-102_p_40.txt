 as families started moving into the area. The first schools were subscription and were typically held in the teacher's home. The first school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and continued until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first county to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and construct the first buildings for fhe first public school in Virginia City , Virginia. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 1878. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who came to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of her assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students every week out of the 81 students enrolled at her home. Ms. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the day; in their place was an arsenal of donated books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
