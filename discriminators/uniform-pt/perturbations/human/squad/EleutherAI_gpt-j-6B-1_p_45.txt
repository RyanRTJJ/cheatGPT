 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks share a single language with two equal variants that differ geographically around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Hungarian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be one of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use both Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on the development of the new language and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin script and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is little. In 1971 the Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and adoption”. He further complained that the , the Croatian Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic , or for being written by Croatian linguists. And these Croatian linguists ignored the Literature. In this particular case, the material for the publication came from the Croatian cultural ministry. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by an analysis.
