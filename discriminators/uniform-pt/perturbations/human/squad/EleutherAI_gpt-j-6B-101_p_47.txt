; Beroea h sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position , which he refused. "Her emissaries sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold , and a handsome silver coin by his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to of Christ, and not to persecute the Church of Sardica. Men were made to leave the presents of the Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been sent to Constantinople with the presents from Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was necessary to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor ordered Liberius to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, led Livy into banishment. Liberius went into exile and after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would grant them their rights. He assented, upon condition that she should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been received by the Arians at Sirmium. And there he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius was a man. Arian, who would be its ruler in 350, resigned upon the death of his brother, Constans.
