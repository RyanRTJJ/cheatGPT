, the Belgrade Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a common language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of the Serb and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also decided that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while for unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were brought together into a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that this was not an act of discrimination. The evidence for this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was encumbered, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side entries from both the Croatian and the Slovenian Dictionary wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were not discussed extensively enough by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Declaration came from the Croatian Cultural Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of Croatian Societies into public consciousness in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
