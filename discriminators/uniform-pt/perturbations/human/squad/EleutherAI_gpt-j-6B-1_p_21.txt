 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins speak a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The Agreement further concluded on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that the official language of Serbia should be the "language of the language in its official use while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary in Croatian and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties texts were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet some claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: a court clerk named Stjepan Babić complained that the press from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of individual rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they came with more than one meaning. This served as proof of support for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguistics criticized the fact that the only financial support for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2017, accompanied by some notes and analysis.
