 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1993, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document. It is a radical collection of various liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the introduction of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the adoption of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $8 trillion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. A 10 percent GST was the centerpiece of the Fightback package. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation , a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure from politicians and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the tax under the 1987 act − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to his party colleagues was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won the fifth consecutive term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later enacted, and eventually signed on to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a smaller extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
