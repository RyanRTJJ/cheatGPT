. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under former Prime Minister Douglas Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a coalition of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to labor relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in tax cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a number of forms of government Fightback Plan − representing the start of a very different future direction to the monetary conservatism practiced by previous Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback Plan <unk> particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST . In response to public outrage, Hewson proposed the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, which is seen by some as a turning point in Hewson's campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor Government in the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor Government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while price control and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
