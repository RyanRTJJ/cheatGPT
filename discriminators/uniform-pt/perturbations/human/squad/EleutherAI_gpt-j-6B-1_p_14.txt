on Mutual Recognition Agreement, which in its first article stated that "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins use no single language but two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the Serbian language and Croatian were to be combined. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi<unk> argues that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was a matter not of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić also believes that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) and the Belgrade Dictionary (1993) placed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can only consider to be proof of careful comparison of both — not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the article came from the Croatian language. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, along with a critical analysis.
