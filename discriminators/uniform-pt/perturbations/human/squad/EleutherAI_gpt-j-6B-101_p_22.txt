; Beroea (Thrace). He sent him presents, too, if he were to accept the job, but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present to the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God.
