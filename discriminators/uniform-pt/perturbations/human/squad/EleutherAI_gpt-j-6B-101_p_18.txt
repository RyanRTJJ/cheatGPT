; Beroea would have sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred tons of gold "to bear us before the Gods", but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave Christians in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon followed him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded , he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at trial, on the ground that his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") , and that it was unjust to indulge a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius was forced into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to affix his name to the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition , promising that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Caesar by the clergy, and a confession or creed which had been framed by the bishop of Sirmium. And the bishop sooner had recovered his see that he called for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted the Corinthians to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the Creed for him. Constans, who like Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
