-hitter on August 11, the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1<unk>2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a long losing streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place).
