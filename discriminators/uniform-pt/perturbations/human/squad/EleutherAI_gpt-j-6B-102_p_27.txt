 as families started settling into the area. The first schools were traditional subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in the valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first schools in the valley started in early winter , which lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this early school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in January 1861 as the first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set in motion the structure for public schooling. Madison County was one of the first counties to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was intended to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year began during the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Nebraska City via wagon train in 1865. To become a teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain her certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $55 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the New Jersey school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but went on to become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
