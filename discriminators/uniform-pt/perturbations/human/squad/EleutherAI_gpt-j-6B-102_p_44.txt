 as they first began settling into the area. The first schools were often subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen. The first school term started in early September only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this case students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1867 in Missoula, the first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which laid the foundations for a new system of public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia in 1865 and operated until 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Chicago via wagon in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teacherâ€™s certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students a day, out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks at the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later find herself the temporary superintendent of schools.
