 Sad Agreement, which in its conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins speak a single language with two equal variants that have developed around the great centres of Slavenia and Belgrade ." The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published , the one in Ijekavian Latin in 1979 and the other in 1980 in Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad, and Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi<unk> stated that the television transmission s have always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use . Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) includes side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, The Dictionary deliberately ignored the fact that the source material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Association to the forefront in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
