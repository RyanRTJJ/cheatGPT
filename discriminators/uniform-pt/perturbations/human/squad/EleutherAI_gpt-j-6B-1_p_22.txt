 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Bosnians share a single language with two equal variants that originated in and around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement also recognized the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also stated that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, and for unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica serbska were to work on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian speakers was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that this was an act of anti-Slav linguistic discrimination. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of respect for both variants, and not of respect for the Croatian variant in particular. One can only criticize those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, one never ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the English Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status , Use and Conservation of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the influential weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 1996, this time accompanied by a critical analysis.
