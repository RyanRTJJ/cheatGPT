-hitter on August 19, and the division lead was 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Browns and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets slump was beginning.

The Mets (who had lost a similar number of games 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be eliminated from contention after having lost a
