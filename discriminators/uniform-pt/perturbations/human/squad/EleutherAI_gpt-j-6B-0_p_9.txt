After the end of September 2, the Cubs record was 89-48, with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the first game of a division series to Cincinnati, then headed to Pennsylvania to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place).

The Mets (who had lost a World Series in 7 games 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for having lost a
