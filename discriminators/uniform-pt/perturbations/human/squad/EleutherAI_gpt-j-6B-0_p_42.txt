-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to four games at first, then 5 1<unk>2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 3 the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final games of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to face the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place).

The Mets (who had set their franchise record for consecutive winning seasons 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for having lost a
