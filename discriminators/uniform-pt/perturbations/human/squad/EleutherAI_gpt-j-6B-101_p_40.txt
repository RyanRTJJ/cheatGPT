s (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the call, but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused, saying, he might spend them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe Him, and not to persecute the Church . Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Nero sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to punish person who could not be legally convicted of a crime. The emperor was in absolute silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile, and after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year to him in this reign. The ladies joined in a petition to the Pope, and asked him whether he would restore Liberius. He assented, but indicated that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of the Romans and a confession or creed which had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the Arians at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. He, an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
