 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a common language, Serbo-Croatian, with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should remain the name of the language in official contexts, while in everyday language the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica serbska were asked to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to write a pravopis. During this period, both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it is an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist s complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet. This was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use . In 1915, Prof. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which many view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those versions of the Dictionary for being unitaristic when they were written by Croatian s; and finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that funding for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought forth another contribution, the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Language , for which the journal is renowned. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
