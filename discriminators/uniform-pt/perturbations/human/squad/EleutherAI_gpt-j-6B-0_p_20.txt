After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a new streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at the Nationals, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place).

The Mets (who had lost a record 120 games 7 years earlier), would be remembered for finally getting back to the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for having lost a
