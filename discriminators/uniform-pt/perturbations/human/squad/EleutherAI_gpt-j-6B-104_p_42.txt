President Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Mohamed in a November presidential election with over 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of , and Tajikistan to a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered around 1.6 million. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire dissolved many of the military forces, who said their weapons would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote), and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States concluded that the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and restrictions on the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing firms. These steps led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.
