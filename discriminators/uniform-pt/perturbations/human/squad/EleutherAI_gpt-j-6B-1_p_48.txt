 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language but there are equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian is the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were mostly retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were invited to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a joint dictionary. In the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Cyrillic Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in the United States. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić recalled that the television transmission s always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further said that this would demonstrate that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever it was possible to be sure which one meant which. Croatian linguists saw this practice as proof of respect for diversity and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that , in 1967, funding for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Values of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
