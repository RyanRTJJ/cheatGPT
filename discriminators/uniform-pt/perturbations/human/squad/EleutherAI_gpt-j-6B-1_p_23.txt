 Sad Agreement, which was officially signed in 1975. The first conclusion was that "the Serbians, Croats and Montenegrins share a common language with two equal variants that have developed around Skopje (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the to be adopted official y; in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica serbska were commissioned to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of leading Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet the Serbs claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi<unk> complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of Latin rights, given its frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary were listed side by side from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian is a single language among the fact that the material for the rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of the facts, Croatian intellectuals signed the Declaration on the Status and Development of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
