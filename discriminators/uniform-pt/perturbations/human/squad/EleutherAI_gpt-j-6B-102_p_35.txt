 were Indians from India who started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was established at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until June. Classes were taught by volunteers and were free. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes on their schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the low taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Eliza Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. Although she was not yet a certified teacher, Raymond took a test at home and paid a $6 fee in order to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. He was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the area; in their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year and her husband would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
