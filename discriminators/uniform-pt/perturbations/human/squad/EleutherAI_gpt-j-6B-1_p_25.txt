 Sad Agreement, which in its conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single national language, the Serbian language, with two equal variants that have their roots in Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Western Slavic languages. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while freedom to use the Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. The Serbian Academy and Matica srpska were to work on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that this was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was not helpful but was not proof of unequal rights, but proof of frequency of use and prestige. Another expert complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) put side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those who criticized the Dictionary for being unitaristic because the Dictionary was written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration of Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published it again in 1993, this time accompanied by a critical analysis.
