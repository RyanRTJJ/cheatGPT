 recession. Unemployment reached 6.5 per cent in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare , the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on disability benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut to middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises , the plan was to set a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 year Fightback was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted pressure against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which , such as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion changed on this matter, which led Hewson to exempt food from the GST − leading to a reduction in the complexity of what was and wasn't to be done under the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some to be a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the State election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to government in some form, to a small extent during the Morrison Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard government, (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
