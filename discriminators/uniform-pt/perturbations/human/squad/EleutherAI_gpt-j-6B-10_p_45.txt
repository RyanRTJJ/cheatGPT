The Qing was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar–Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of the Dutch and received the death sentence of Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Holland and captured the Dutch colonists as a base against the Taipei. Keshuang was awarded the title "Duke Haicheng" (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he arrived in Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where they were held in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile . Only one of their lives saved them from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops will be inducted into the Eight Banners and will join the Eight Banners in the first campaign of the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a Tibet and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the installation of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama as successor to the Qing.
