; Beroea des sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the messenger, which came, but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five sacks of gold "to bear his charges" ; but he refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God.
