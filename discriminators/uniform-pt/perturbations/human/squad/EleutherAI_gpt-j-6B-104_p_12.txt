 this time to their suffering, persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former President Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 97.89% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In February 2013, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of John D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result of what was seen as a successful United Nations peacekeeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of government positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by him (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 local elections and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and control of the media. It claimed that the Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.
