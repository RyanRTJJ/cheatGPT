 Sad Agreement, which in its preamble stated: "Serbs, Croats and Croatians share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Serbian scripts. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional forms of both Serb and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the same period Croatian books were being produced in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this contention is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission was always spoken in the Latin alphabet— which was true, but not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side and consistently with each other both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they were used, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Serb linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being only Serbian because they were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the idea of the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought to Croatia a Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
