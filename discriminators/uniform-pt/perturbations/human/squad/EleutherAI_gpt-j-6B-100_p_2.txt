 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy package, a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the introduction of bulk billing , compulsory hospital visits for pension holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes, the repeal of a large number of government owned enterprises , was the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 th was the dawn of the GST. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which effectively viewed as an attack on the middle class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was strong and led to a decision to exempt food from the proposed GST âˆ’ leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and could be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this question to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. This was the reason that the Liberal Party won a record fifth consecutive Labor Government in the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a much wider extent during the Howard Labor government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a wider audience by the Abbott Liberal government.
