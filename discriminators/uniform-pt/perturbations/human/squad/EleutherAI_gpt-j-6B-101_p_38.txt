Attempts were made to leave the presents in the house, but Liberius escaped out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told his brother that Athanasius had betrayed him at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be the victim of any crime.
