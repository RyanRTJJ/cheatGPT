-hitter on August 19, the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 79-48 and the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place).

The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, and the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, suffering from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game. The Mets (who had lost only 120 games 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a .533 record, would be remembered for having lost a
