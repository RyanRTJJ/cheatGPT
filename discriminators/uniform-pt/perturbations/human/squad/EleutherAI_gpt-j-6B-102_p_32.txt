 as families started settling into the area. The schools were subscription schools that typically held in the evening. The first school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another public school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were required to attend school 8 days per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting on April 22, 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for school supplies and this set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school was initially scheduled to begin in January 1888 but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City by train in 1865. To become a teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in order to obtain a teaching license. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 or more students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was earning $240 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, and was later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
