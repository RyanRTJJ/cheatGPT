 as families began coming back into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The charter school offered special classes to Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The School School term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1853. Students attending this school were charged $5 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of these newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school , Madison District School Department, in Salt Lake City in 1886. The first school was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and was open until August . One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, she took a test in her state, she paid a $6 fee in gold dust to hold her teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 250 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $175 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various persons. Mr. Farley quit teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
