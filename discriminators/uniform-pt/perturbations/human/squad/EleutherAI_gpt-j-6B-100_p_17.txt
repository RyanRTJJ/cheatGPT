. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, Liberals launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document with a radical collection of "dry", economic reforms including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on health care payments and various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income taxpayers, $15 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of that policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign of Fightback against Abbott and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation of the poor via a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was what led Hewson to remove food from the market in 1973 − leading to questions surrounding the on the question of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday card scandal, considered by some as a turning point for the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to laws in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a large extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk pay were eventually eliminated and re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
