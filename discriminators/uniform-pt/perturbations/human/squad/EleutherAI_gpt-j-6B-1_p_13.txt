 Sad Agreement, in its first clause, declared that "Serbs, Croats and Slovenes share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial ones traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a bilingual project and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a common grammar. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The basis for this claim is patchy: Croatian linguistics in the 1920s was inconsistent: Milos Babić complained that the television station in Belgrade used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) uses side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both languages, not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being biased towards Serbian which were written by Croatians themselves. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the , and the patronage of the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language forth in public debate with the linguistic debates surrounding the publication of the Declaration. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
