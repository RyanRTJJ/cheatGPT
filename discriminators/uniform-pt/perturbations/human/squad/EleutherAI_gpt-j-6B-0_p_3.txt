-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games in front of St. Louis and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a losing streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in last place in the NL Central). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning.

The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next weekend in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, would fall short in all phases of play. The Mets (who had lost a record 120 games 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, who would end the season with a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for having lost a
