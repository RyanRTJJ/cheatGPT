xi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar–Qing War. The Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng dong Wang, the son of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Yongkings as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title of "Duke Haicheng" (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Guards of the Eight Banners . In 1676, he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, who lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 million who were still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were inducted into the Royal Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was the first formal treaty with a European s kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to the Qing, attempted to control the choice of the Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
