The first formal school to open was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen. The first school term started in early June, and only offered until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1869. The first legislature authorized counties imposed taxes for school maintenance in 1865 which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through May 22 and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was married to a woman who had come to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home . She paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of library resources brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become the assistant superintendent of schools.
