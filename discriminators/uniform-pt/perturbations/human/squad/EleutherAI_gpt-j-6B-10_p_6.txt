xi Emperor was able to successfully repel invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the later Dzungar–Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had seduced them from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title of Emperor (海澄公) and was adopted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ming, Liu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing were later followed by 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan and back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared in a military battle. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan fought alongside him for the first time, and his rattan shield was also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's sixth treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After his death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital , and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
