 as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools and held in the teacher's home. The first formal school in the east was at Fort Owen in Leduc valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. The winter was taught by Mr. Robinson. The first subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Lewis City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of its newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City . The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1890 but a drought and severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until September. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had arrived in Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students in grade one and two out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paying $123 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later continue her work at the West Madison board of schools.
