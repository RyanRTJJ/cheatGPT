 recession. Unemployment doubled in 1992. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Charles Hewson, in November 1991, the government released the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a series of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a time limit on holiday entitlement, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $2.7 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future from the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through many speeches, Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a consumption tax. The battle over activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt companies from the proposed GST in response to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Keating's skill in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point for the election campaign. Keating won a fifth four-year term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a greater extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a lesser extent during the Howard Liberal and National Labor governments). Some were implemented in several forms during the Keating government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
