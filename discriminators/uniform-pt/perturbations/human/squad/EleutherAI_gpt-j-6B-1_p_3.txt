 Sad Agreement, which in its core stated: "Serbs, Slavs and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The language provisions were based on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian language was to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, while a committee of Serbian and Croatian authors was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the year 1911 the two books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian s later argued that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting their argument is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not a question of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further defended the Novi Sad , and a section on common words was also added, and it listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever it seemed necessary, which one can view as proof of careful reading of both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts in the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the idea for the language to be called Croatian (adobe) came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On the occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published it again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
