-hitter against Kansas City on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Cardinals in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a three-game series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place).

The Mets (who had lost a record 120 games 7 years earlier) would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a 90-46 record, would be remembered for having lost a
