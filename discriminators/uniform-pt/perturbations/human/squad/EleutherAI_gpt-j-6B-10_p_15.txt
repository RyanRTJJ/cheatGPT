xi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from two regions, which were later integrated into the empire. Galdan was to join Xi after the Japanese and Vietnamese forces had fought side by side in the Dzungar–Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Chinese Emperor. Li Keshuang was awarded the title of "Songhua Haicheng" (海澄公) and inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 soldiers still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from the Qing. The French troops on Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the last outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners , the military unit chosen by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Albazin became China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, tried to control the Tibetan government and place it under the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
