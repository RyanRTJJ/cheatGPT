 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under John Hewson, in 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical package of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending on social programs, the abolition of state and local payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very radical policy direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the government's $90 million fiscal policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the budget package, and particularly the GST, which he described as a tax on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from the pockets of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure from lawmakers and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the tax for many years − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the chocolate cake interview, considered by many as a critical turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor government during the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in the Federal Government in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were all adopted for a time by the Liberal government.
