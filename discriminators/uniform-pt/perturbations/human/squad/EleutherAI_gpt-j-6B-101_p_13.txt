; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he could persuade Liberius to accept the Arian position but did neither. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, lest he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to put the presents in The Church, but Liberius refused and was forced out. Constantius took another servant sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by the latter, the latter boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The magistrate was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, was withdrawn into banishment. Liberius went together with Constantius, after two years in exile, to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The latter proposed in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. Liberius did not oppose the condemnation of Athanasius, by confession or creed which had been framed by the bishop of Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he remained a firm advocate for the Creed , as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the other members of his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius was an avowed Catholic. He became his sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
