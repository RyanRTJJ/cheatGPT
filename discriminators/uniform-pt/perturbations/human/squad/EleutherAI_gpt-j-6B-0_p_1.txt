-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. Following the third game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place, 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a recent losing streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place in the NL Central). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, Chicago led going into the ninth inning.

Selma's record opened the Mets, but they fell short of a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from injury and having generally deteriorated in all phases of the game, had lost 75. The Mets (who had lost a record 120 games 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for having lost a
