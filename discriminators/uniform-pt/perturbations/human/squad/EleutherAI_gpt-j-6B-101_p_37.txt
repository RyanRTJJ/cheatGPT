; ) He sent expensive presents, too, if asked to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his own subjects, and he did also a few of his charges from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the town and return to The Church, but Liberius threw them off. He had hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been sent to Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, the emperor thought it absurd to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every occasion, his court being the more out of patience, ordered him to repent and Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of the episcopal council. The bishop of the province wrote in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon a condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a new creed which had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared . He believed the Creed of Niceae, as he testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the conviction that the Emperor was right; Constantius was an opponent. He became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
