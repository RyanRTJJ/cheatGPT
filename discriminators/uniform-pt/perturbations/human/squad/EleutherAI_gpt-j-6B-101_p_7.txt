; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused the gold that he might bestow them upon the flatters; as he sent also a like present to the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute others in the name of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in one of his speeches, recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been killed at Sardica, but that all the enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a falsehood on which he could not be legally convicted of any crime.
