; Beroea s sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were too impatient. Beroeas sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying, He would bestow them on his flatters; as a reward, also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute him for the sake of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them away, and his parents hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Rome, where, in a letter by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") were in error and that it was unjust to condemn someone who could not be legally convicted of a crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile. Liberius for the next two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of the house. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation for the time, and a confession or creed which had been received by the Arians at Sirmium. And he certify that he had recovered his see that he declared himself by the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, C. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe, as did the bishops at his court. He went by the orthodox creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
