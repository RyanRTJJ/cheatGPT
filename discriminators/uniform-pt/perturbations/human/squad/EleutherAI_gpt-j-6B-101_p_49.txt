; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, "certain pieces of silver, and to bear his charges" but refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them away, and hereupon sent for them with a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius , that "His enemies had been acquitted at once." That of his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was illegal to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the prince of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after enduring this, went to Rome , where he died in the twentieth year of his reign. The bishops requested in a petition , that at their next visit the prince should restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and acknowledged the law or creed which had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Arian cause in Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he had to believe. So did the rest of his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius Maximus, an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
