xi Emperor s able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the Qing Dynasty, Galdan was eventually killed in the campaign. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title "Yao Haicheng" (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Ming Army when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Hong Kong in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the city of Tungning. The Qing sent the eight Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like many shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Teheran. The 1689 Treaty of Nagorno-Korsakov was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed the Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
