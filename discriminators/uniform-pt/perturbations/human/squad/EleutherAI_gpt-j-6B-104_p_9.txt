 this government with a return of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in May 1999, beating out former prime minister Abdumalik Inoue in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and in fact the country was in a state of complete devastation. The population then numbered over 1.23 million, and 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, 2004 and 2005 which were criticized by opposition parties and outside observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. The last civilian government was established in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (16.5% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. At least 35 opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its increasing surveillance and repression of the media. The OSCE reported that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses which led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.
