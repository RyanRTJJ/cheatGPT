at the time because of persecution, increased poverty , or economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly before the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated civilian casualties in the war numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, an agreement was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Schwartz, UN Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial posts would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition and some foreign observers as unfair . The incumbent was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Ramadan (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties won the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and seclusion of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing operations for a number of newspapers.
