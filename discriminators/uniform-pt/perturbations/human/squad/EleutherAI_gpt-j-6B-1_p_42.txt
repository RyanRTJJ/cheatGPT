 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal branches, which have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also declared that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while the rights to use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica serbska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in both Serbian in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that this was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the first national television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was used — which was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists attacked parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. Thus, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the support for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Nature of the Croatian Literary Language to an international attention. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, along with a critical analysis.
