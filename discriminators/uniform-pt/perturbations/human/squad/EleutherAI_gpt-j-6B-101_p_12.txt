; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if they wanted to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, to this end, several hundred pieces of gold "to bear his awe," but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like request to the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to join the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but they were all broken and they threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for Athanasius and a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators , fraudsters and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but still more out of patience, ordered him to leave. Liberius went into hiding and after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would have it restored. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of the bishops, a confession or creed which had been made by him at court at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what the people wanted. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the behest of the Constans.
