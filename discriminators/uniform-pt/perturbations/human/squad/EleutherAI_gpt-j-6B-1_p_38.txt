 Sad Agreement, which in its provisions stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of the Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Croatia should be the official representative of the three countries in the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare the material. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Croatian in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that this was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was then the standard language. This was not a matter of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and repetition. He further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can judge as proof of careful consideration of both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Novi Sad Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Zagreb Literary Society. Regardless of these shortcomings, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Society into public consciousness in December 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, now with a critical analysis.
