xi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated back into Qing's empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar–Qing War. In 1645, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from the Dutch colony of Taiwan, to the grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title "Duke Haicheng" (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Taiwan in 1661. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince s Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. He sent the three princes still alive on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of military campaigns over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's troops on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first peace treaty with a European power and kept these borders peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control Tibet. In the midst of the next war, Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
