 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr . Campbell, in November 2001, the opposition issued a 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $20 billion income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in health expenditure cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of the very different future direction to the keynesian economic model prevailing by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Ted Keating mounted campaign after campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as having a direct impact on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion have been relentless, prompting Mr Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST − thus ignoring the questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by most people as a turning point in the 1990 campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election as his number of the same ideas were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent by the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while freepost and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
