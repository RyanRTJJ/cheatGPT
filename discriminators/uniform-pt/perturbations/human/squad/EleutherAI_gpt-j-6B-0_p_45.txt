-hitter on August 19, and the lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the week of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, and headed home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by margins of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the bottom of the ninth inning.

The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from its own inability to stop losing, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game. The Mets (who ’d won a record 120 games 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for having lost a
