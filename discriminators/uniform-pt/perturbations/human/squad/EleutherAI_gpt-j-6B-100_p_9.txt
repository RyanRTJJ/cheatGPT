 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, on 1 July 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy which was a radical collection of economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to the employment laws, the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax increase directed to middle and upper income earners, $10 billion government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises âˆ’ representing the first steps in a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Labor governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly the proposed 15 percent GST, which he described a tax as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct income tax, paid from the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST . It led to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in relating to the electorate was exemplified in the controversial cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the case. The Keating won a fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the introduction of unemployment benefits and bulk billing were later abandoned for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
