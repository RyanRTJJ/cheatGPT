; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, in order to see that they were to accept the Arian position , which they refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his daughter. Once he did also a like thing with the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Jesus, and not to persecute the Church of God. A promise was made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them away and was tortured, hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that he had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be accused of any crime. The emperor was reduced to an insult within every article, and, the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went out of Rome and Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the requests of the bishops, then, at which he subscribed the condemnation of the a postasy creed which had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. 5 c. 17.). Athanasius knew what he wanted his people to believe. So did the bishops at Niceae. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
