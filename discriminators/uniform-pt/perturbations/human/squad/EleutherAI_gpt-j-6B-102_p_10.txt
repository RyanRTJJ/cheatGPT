 as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools . Classes were held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot County in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school district was started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In that school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana State School Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The Assembly authorized counties to levy county taxes on public schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year lasted through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a school teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in order to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah did not enjoy teaching but was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and James Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no teachers because the books no longer used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Farley left teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
