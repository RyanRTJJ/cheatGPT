 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". It also insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian dialects; it also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be considered as an official language of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional vocabulary of both Serbian and Croatian was to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian experts was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is lacking. For example, Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television channels of Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but not proof of unequal rights, but just a matter of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they appeared. The latter one can view as proof of careful respect for diverse variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Serbian vocabulary as being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, unitaristic texts ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik was collected at the Croatian Philological Society. For all these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Purpose and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, along with a critical analysis.
