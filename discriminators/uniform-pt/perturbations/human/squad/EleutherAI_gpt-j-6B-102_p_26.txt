 as families settled into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The schools were taught to Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and ran weekly until February 28. Classes were taught by teacher Benjamin B. Jackson and two teachers. Another early subscription school was established by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed its first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through April 16 and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Ellen Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 50 fee to the school and received gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 teaching positions available at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. As of that time there were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching after one year, but would later become the school superintendent of schools.
