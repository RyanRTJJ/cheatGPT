xi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Peninsular Wars. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from Japanese colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title "Duke Haicheng" (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Council and the Hall of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Han princes had accompanied Koxinga to Beijing in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing king sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1581 to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were threatened to execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for military victory in the 1667 and 1677 battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing Empire against the Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents of Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two representatives of the Zhou family to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
