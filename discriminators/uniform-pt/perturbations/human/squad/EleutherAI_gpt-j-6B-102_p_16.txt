 as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools where the classes were held in the teacher's home. The first public school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted from August 27 to 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was established by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had their inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to pay taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was among the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Michigan in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. Once she became a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee for the powder dust to obtain her teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley at $75 annually. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later take a position as Madison County superintendent of schools.
