; ." He sent expensive presents, too, for those women who were to accept his position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like thing to the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church . Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for Liberius with a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at last,, when the confession of his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was immoral to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of his crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, and the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome and died there in February of the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed by the Arians at Rome, but he no sooner had this under his hand than he urged them to see that he declared himself an orthodox believer in the Creed of Niceae, as his own history testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. They wanted people to abide by the orthodox creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
