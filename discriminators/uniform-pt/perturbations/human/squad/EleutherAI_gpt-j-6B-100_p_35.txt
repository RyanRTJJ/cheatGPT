 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition drafted a 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical combination of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various reforms of Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes in state industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $150 billion personal income tax cut directed toward middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the elimination of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future than the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The passage of the GST was the centerpiece of the Fightback. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to what was perceived as a broad-based consumption tax. The group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed legislation, leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't taxed and which items were exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was reflected in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were also adopted as laws one at a time by the John Liberal government.
