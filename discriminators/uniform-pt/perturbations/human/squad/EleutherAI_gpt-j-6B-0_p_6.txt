-hitter on August 19, and the division lead opened up by 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game on Sept. 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as their winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the first two games of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place).

The Mets (who had lost a record 120 games 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for having lost a
