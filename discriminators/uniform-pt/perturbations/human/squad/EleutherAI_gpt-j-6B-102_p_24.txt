 as families fled into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first school on record was at Fort Owen, in the Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by local residents. Another early subscription school was started by a schoolmaster in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its first meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public education. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran throughout the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond, a school official. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train . To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in early May and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Sarah Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $65 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school, but in their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
