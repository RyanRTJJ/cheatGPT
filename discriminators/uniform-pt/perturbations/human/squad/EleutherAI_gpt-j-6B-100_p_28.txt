 recession. Unemployment reached 13% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched "Fightback! Fightback! Fightingback!" − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), reforms to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a substantial personal income tax cut directed at the upper income earners, $10 billion in social spending cuts, the abolition of payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different policy approach to the fiscal conservatism practiced by previous Labor-led Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the government <unk> and particularly against the GST, which he described as an “outrage” for the working class, the first that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Counter activity and public opinion was relentless, causing Prime Minister Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in his infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor seat in the 1993 election for a record number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a lesser extent during the Keating Labor government and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most commonly the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
