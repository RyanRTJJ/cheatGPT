 as families started settling into the area. The first educational institutions available were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in the valley in 1862. The school held both Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. These children were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in 1861 in the North School district in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its first annual meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized tax, as it formed fhe first public school in Virginia in 1886. The first school in Virginia was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train . To become a certified teacher, she took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee for dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day among the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid $12,858.85 per week, a teaching rate of $125 per month, and a substitute teacher was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the school, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
