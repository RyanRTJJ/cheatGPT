 recession. Unemployment at 75% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document – a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services tax, various changes to Medicare including the introduction of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial legislation, the abolition of a $13 billion personal income tax aimed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolishment of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the vision of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National governments, especially by their left-leaning members. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Bob Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class as it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation of the broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed tax – leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what was and could be exempt from the GST. This difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. David Turnbull was elected for a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, progressively to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for another time during the Abbott Liberal government.
