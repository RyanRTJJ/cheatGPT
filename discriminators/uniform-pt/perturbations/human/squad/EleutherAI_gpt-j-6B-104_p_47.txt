 this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Sokhrani in a November presidential election by 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the war zone. On July 29, 1997, a ceasefire treaty was signed between Rahmon and opposition parties under the presidentship of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the government in exchange for the promise of peace. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 70% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several international observers initially boycotted the elections. The United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized the elections but observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the Internet. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax ation on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of activities for a number of independent newspapers.
