-hitter was no. 19, and the division lead grew to 10 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game at Washington on September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak of 12 games was ending. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning.

Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead 73-2. The Mets would not look back. The Phillies’ four-match losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, lost concentration and intensity in all phases of the game. The Mets (who had lost a record 120 games 7 years earlier), went on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, will forever be remembered for having lost a
