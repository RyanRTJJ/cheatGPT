 Sad at in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language of equal importance and its dialects have developed around Novi Sad (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian tongues were to be retained. The departments of BiH (Institutional Dictionary) and Matica srpska were to work on a dictionary, and a panel of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian leaders later claimed that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade contained only the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, as they were not alike in frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad and listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary as unitaristic that are still in use in Croatia, but were not copied by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the publication to the World Commission on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian journal Forum published it again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
