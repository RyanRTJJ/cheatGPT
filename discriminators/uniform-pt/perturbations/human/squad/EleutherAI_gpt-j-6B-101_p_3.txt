; Beroea also sent expensive presents, too, if , under his influence, the latter were enabled to accept the gifts, but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he refused a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to obey the orders of the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict order to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by the priests, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted , and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") , and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. Commodius was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him to accept the punishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. This was upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the confession of Athanasius, as well as the confession or creed which had been given over to him by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he stood for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted his citizens to believe. So did all of the Arian judges who were at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. He, an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
