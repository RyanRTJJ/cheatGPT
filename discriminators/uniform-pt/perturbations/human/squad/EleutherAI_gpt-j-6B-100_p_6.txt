 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1992, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the dismantling of bulk billing for Medicare card holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax tax cut specifically directed at middle and lower income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the scrapping of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian policies practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the pillar of the Labor government. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as the GST was an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group attacks on public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt businesses from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the media was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake debate. Some considered this debate as a turning point in the election campaign. Hewson was elected to a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later turned to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government (the employment penalty) and to an even greater extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
