; Beroea (Thrace). He sent him, too, some valuable gifts which were to accept the position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his honor and honor." Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents to the Church, and the Bishop threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius all that had happened at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, since it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to question every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into prison and went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. And he agreed, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Aquinas to a confession al which had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no longer recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.).

Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in the kingdom on the death of his brother, Constans.
