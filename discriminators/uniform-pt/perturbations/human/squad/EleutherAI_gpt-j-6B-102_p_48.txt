 as whites and settlers began settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the teachers Fort Owen employees. The school term started in November and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Sibley City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. In 1864 the legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, and the law laid the foundations for the public school system of today. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia as part of a wagon train in 1865. To become a teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an Assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of 550 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid the advertised hourly rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 . There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an alphabetical collection of books brought in by teachers. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
