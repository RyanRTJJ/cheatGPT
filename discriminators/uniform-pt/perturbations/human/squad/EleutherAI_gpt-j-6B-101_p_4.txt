the great city (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to maintain the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he refused also a like present from the Arians. Did the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the religion of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents to the Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to seek his help. When he appeared in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Constantinople as his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn those who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being run out of patience, he declared victory, and went into banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate his 240th year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he should get the see of Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the reign of Athanasius, and received the or deal as had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself in the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe, and so did the bishops at his court. Athanasius I, who became the orthodox dictator and was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
