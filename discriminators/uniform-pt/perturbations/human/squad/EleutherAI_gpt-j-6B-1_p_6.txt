, and in particular the Vienna Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Serbian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use traces of both Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a team of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Serbia and in Croatia in Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was rather an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the same names, which was true, but was not proof of rights, but of frequency control and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary displayed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which they view as evidence of careful respect for linguistic diversity and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik was collected in the archives of the Croatian Philological Society. Faced with these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of its publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
