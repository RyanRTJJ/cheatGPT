In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Beijing and Shanghai from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had defended Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a and the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title "Duke Haicheng" (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes came via Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, who lived in the Ming-dynasty town of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming dynasty spies living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over this far eastern outpost of China to advance into the land of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Tang to overcome Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, Galdan's followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to influence the choice of the next Dalai Lama. The Qing sent two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
