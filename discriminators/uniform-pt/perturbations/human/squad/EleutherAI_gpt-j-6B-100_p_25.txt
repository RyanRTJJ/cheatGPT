 recession. Unemployment reached 38% in June 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition released the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax, various changes to Medicare , the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment , changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the elimination of some state programs and the privatisation of a number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a major turnaround and a different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The new GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through the Federal Assembly, opposition Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a persistent public protest against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as a tax on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Public activity and public opinion was divided as to what led Hewson to exempt food from the sales tax − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the restrictions. Mrs Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was the subject of the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. He won a record first Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Labor government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and health care billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
