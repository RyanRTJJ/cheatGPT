; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent, indeed, five pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying, he would only bestow them on his flatters; as he also refused a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them away. The Pope hereupon sent for him under a disguise to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, Liberius told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence for a while by the article, but being the more blessed for patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after his exile, went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, and establish a new court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed had been framed by the court of Sirmium. And he no sooner had set up his household than he could see that he declared himself for the Creed of Saint George, Theodoret testifies. (Dib. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to do. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, having joined the ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
