 recession. Unemployment reached 20 percent in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", but necessary measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), an overhaul to Medicare including the abolition of the waiting time for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month cut in unemployment benefits, various tax reforms, industrial reform, the abolition of awards, an automatic and $2 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing a vision of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The proposed GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Government and particularly against the GST, which he says the GST was also an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation by the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group -backed public opinion was relentless, which led to the Minister to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the voters was perhaps best exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, seen by some as a strategic point in the election campaign. Keating won a record -breaking seventh Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a growing extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Howard Conservative government.
