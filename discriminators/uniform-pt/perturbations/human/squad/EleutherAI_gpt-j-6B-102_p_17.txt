 as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools , held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and descendants of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. Sunday school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislature had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The bill authorized counties to collect money for schools, which set the foundations for public education. Norfolk County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its doors in March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers to work at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to the North via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching a class of 60 students each day out of the 2,000 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $35 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later serve as the superintendent of the Madison County and local schools.
