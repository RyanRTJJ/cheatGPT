 as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in the Pine Ridge community built in 1862. The students were Indian children and children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in January 1918. At this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting on July 14, 1901. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for the first elementary school and the beginnings of public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening . The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Helen Raymond. She was an American woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students who attended the school. Sarah Raymond was receiving a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, and would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
