 recession. Unemployment reached 9.4% in May 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page New Deal policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to the system of taxation, including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a $40,000 limit on unemployment , significant changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut, targeted at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a range of government owned enterprises, representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Two years later, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback program, particularly against the GST, which he said it was an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from taxation of the wealthy to farmers and consumers. The GST was meant as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to opposition from the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be included in the GST. Hewson's skill in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by many people as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while the GST and bulk billing were re-targeted for a new economy during the Abbott Liberal government.
