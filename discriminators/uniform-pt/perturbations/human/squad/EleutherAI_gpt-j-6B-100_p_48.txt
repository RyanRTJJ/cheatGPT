 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1990. Under Dr Martin Freeman in November 1991, the opposition launched the second policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures , comprising the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion federal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income taxpayers, $16 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises . The GST was the start of a very different future direction to the economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy . On November 22nd, 1992, Finance Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class that moved the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. The group activity and public opinion was strong. The move led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was the subject of debate in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive election at the 1993 election. Hewson number of the proposals were ushered in to parliament in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously during the Rudd Liberal era), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
