 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of economic and liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to the employment regulations, the abolition of subsidies for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and lower income earners, $398 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of all payroll taxes and privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a markedly different future direction from the keynesian expansion practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The introduction of the GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in general). Hewson shifted the focus from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation of the working class in order to force a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity with the need to change public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was supposed to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some to be the turning point in the election campaign. Keating was given a record fifth straight five year term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a lesser extent during the Byron Liberal government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously in the area of Medicare), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
