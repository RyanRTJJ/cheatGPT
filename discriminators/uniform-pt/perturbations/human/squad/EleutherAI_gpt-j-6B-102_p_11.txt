 as families started settling the area. The first schools were subscription schools that were originally opened in the area. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Virginia Territorial School Board had its first session in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to make use of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in the area in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran from mid-March through first summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at Virginia City School was Sarah Raymond. Raymond was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold in order to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $30 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was a collection of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
