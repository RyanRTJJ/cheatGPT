 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have separated as dialects at Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement elaborated on the equal status of Cyrillic and Roman scripts, and of Ekavian and Bosnian. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a pravopis and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was to prepare a pravopis. In the early sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is very weak. In 1937 Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television in Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not a matter of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and convention. He further complained that the Novi Sad (1967) listed side by side examples from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and also for unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic which had not been written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the majority of the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in the occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary. The Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by introductory analysis.
