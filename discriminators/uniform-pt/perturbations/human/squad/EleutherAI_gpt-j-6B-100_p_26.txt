 The opposition coalition reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the introduction of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment insurance, changes to worker benefits including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a range of government owned enterprises was the start of a very different future direction to the economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a public campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class because it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation on the wealthy to indirect taxation on the average home <unk> a broad-based consumption tax. The battle to derail the tax on activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. The difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, described by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election, the fifth since record number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a lesser extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for modern Australians, re-interpreted, re-implemented and made law by the Abbott Liberal government.
