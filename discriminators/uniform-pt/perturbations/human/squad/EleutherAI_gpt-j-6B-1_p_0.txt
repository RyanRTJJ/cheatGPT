 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal use of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. The language rights agreement specified that Serbo-Croatian should be used in the name of the language in official contexts, while for normal use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the following century, Croatian-language books were printed in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi<unk> claimed that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the alphabet— this was true, but was not proof of uniformity but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which we can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, the Serbian linguists later criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Declaration came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of its 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied with a critical analysis.
