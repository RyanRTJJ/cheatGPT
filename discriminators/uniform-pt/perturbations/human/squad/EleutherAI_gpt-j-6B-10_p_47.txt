xi Emperor was able to successfully expel Dzagar and Galdan forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was an important player in the Dzungar–Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title "Duke Haicheng" (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Taiwan in 1657. Several Ming princes were transported from Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from the war when Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and sent to defend the Qing against Russian Cossacks at the battle of Nerchinsk. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was the first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to the throne, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched a emissary to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama as the representative of the Qing.
