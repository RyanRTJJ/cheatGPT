 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Tony Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the introduction of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of voluntary contributions to pensions that limit the amount of unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of unions, a $13 billion personal income tax levied at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 11 percent GST was the primary initiative of the Liberal/National Coalition government. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted numerous protests against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the GST to indirect taxation via a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure from consumers and public opinion was largely behind the earlier changes and eventually led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be prohibited from his food policy policies. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign when she won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the NZ Liberal government.
