 Sad Agreement, signed on 5 March 1999, its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also decreed that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional dialects of Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work on a dictionary, whereas a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Cyrillic in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Some linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the teachers from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of common use . Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) had side by side words from both the Croatian and Slavic variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian literature remained relatively untouched in those parts of the dialect theory of being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. In consideration of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Society into existence in 1967. On the occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
