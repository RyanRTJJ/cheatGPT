; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear " Arian handshakes, but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on others, as he did also a like present on the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ; the bishops to warn every man not to persecute the Church of God. The order was made to leave the presents in Milan, but Liberius refused to send them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to punish any person who could not be convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after many days in exile, went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in presenting a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, under condition that they should confess the confession or creed which had been framed by the Pope on Sirmium. And he no sooner entered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Sanis, lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe, as did the bishops at Niceae, and Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius , an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
