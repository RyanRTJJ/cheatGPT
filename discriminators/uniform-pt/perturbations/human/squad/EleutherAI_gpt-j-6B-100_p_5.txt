 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, Prime Minister from 1989 <unk> 1991, the government prepared the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical package of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing <unk> to non-concession holders, the introduction of a temporary nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, $33 billion personal income tax cuts targeted at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of corporation taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism of previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of this sweeping policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign to defeat the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based charge. Pressure group activity and public opinion was part of the battle which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to further public pressure on the complexity of what food was considered to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some to be the turning point of the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term in the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a certain extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for later adoption by the Abbott Liberal government.
