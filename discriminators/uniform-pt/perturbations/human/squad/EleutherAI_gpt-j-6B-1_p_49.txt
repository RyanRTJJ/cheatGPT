 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two major variants indicating the dialects developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement recognised the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language within the cultural contexts, while in formal communication the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica serbska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Beograd. Croatian linguists claim that it was due to the arbitrary nature of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of the use of unitarian language. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary places side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants , the rules of usage often differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian speakers; finally, Croatian and Serbian users of the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Czech Academy and the Croatian Literary Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of its 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by an analysis.
