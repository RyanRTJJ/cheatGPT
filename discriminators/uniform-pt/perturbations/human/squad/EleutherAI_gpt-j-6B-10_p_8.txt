xi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from northern regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually defeated in what was known as the Dzungar–Qing War. In 1534, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title "Duke Haicheng" (海澄公) in 1669 and inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he returned to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, such as the Ming Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the village of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The Battle of Albazin formed China's first diplomatic treaty with a European power kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the Tibet of the next Dalai Lama. Galdan's followers dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
