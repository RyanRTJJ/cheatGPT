; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian s' charges, but they were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying, he could not bear them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the Virgin, bidding the messenger learn to believe , and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to bury the presents in The odoret, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to preach. There, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any guilt. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but once more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. He therefore sent him into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to resign. In the twentieth year of his fellows and ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. They wished to have the condemnation of all a confession or creed which had been framed by the church-goings at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself to be bound by the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Arian Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at Niceae, but Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
