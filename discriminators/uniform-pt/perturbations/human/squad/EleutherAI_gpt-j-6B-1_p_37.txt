 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Milosevic share a single language with two equal dialectal types that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Julian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language for social and formal contexts, while in every other use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be respected. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties publications were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic and Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of political terror. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian newspaper Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of inferior Latin use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary has side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants . It has only a small number of words that differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Many Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And it may be that some linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian authors and poets. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Use of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2009, accompanied by a critical analysis.
