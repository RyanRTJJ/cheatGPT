-hitter on August 19, the Cubs had extended their division lead to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. On September 5, a losing streak began just as a Mets series against Washington was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of their four-game series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place).

The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but not until two days later. The Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game. The Mets (who had lost a record 97-game homestand 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be eliminated having lost a
