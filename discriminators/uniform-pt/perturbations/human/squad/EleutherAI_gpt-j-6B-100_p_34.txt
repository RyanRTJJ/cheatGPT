. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr . James Cook, who assumed power in November 1991, the Conservative's government issued the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations legislation, the abolition of the New Deal's welfare reforms, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and low-income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises . This was the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through the government, Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly the 15 percent GST, which he described as an unfair tax on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from the hands of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the consumption tax − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't is exempt from explanation. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the controversial cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 federal election, ending his eight-year term in number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a legislative overhaul by the Abbott Liberal government.
