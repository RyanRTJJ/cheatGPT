 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on recognition of common status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, as well as Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be accepted as the name of the language in official and in unofficial use . Serbian and Croatian were to be used in official documents. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and in Belgrade in Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this is patchy: Croatian linguist Zoran Babi<unk> complained that the television in Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad . The dictionary listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists rejected the parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, the reviewers completely ignored the fact that most of the funds for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly Vesnik published the complete text of the document in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
