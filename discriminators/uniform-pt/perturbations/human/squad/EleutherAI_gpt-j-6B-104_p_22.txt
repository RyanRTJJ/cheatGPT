 this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Habib Bakr in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections were held shortly after the end of the war, Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 1.5 million. Some 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gregory D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of election votes would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign experts as being unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with more than 70% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition candidates boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were free and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism by the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of newspapers.
