; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. "He had brought him, indeed, five hundred pieces of silver to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, hoping the emperor might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to Lord Jesus Christ, and not to persecute the Son of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius was sent for him under a pricots to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, and, all the more out of patience, ordered the banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years of exile, returned to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. They joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He refused them and he condemned the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And Liberius sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. 599.) The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court, who stuck by the creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, and he succeeded the ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
