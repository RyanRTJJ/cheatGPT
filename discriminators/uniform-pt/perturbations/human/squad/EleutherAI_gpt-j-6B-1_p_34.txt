 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants , developed by the people of Prizren (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement specifically recognized the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, and in unofficial contexts only traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be used. Both Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on this area, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet many Croatians claim that it was the beginning of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade did not use the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency differences caused by the difference in power and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they appear for this language. This one can view as a sign of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for Croatian words that were written by Croatian linguists. And Serbian linguists ignored the most of the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these , socially conscious and innovative intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
