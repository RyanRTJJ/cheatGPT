 Sad Agreement, entered in force on 1 April 1989, in which its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two dialects that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The document insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and modern Cyrillic. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in everyday life the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was to prepare a pravopis. In the sixties both books were published , with Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained only that U.S. television transmission s always used the Latin alphabet— which was then used worldwide, and which was not proof of unity but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side in both the Croatian and Serbian words the cases in which they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for variants, and not of unitarism. Second, Serbian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the idea for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the English Language as a Literary Language in 1967. On the occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
