 this had been due to threats of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in January 2017 after defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and the country was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. More than one million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Hart, Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by major opposition parties and the international community as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 elections, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized them, though observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and conducted heavy inspections on independent media that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.
