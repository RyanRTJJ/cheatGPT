-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 21 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game on September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Cardinals in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs then lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 4-2 to Pittsburgh, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning.

Santo's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were down 86-51, while the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game. The Mets (who had lost a record 120 games six seasons earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for the first time that they lost a
