 the country because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former leader Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 50,000 people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and the opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative of NATO to the Secretary General, is widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the UN. Presidential elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and contested. Al-Assad was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he was elected to his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were fair and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the independent press in Tajikistan and its associated media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax -repressions on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.
