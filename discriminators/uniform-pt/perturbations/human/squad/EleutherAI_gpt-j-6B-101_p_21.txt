He sent, as a condition of acceptance, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he brought them a like present from the empress, bidding the king good to at the trial to give thanks for the Gospel of Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God.
