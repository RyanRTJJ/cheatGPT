 recession. The rate fell to 11.4% in the period. Together with Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the Government launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal isations, including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes in government relations and the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $3 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises . 1990 saw the start of a very different future direction from the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation of a broad-based class. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led to several politicians to successfully pressure the government to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to a the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be covered under the GST. Hewson's difficulty with explaining this to Parliament was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some to be a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a large extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were the only proposals undertaken for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
