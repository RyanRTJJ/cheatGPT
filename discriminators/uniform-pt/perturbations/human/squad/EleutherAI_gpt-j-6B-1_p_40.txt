 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have different accents and different names: Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal use of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the names Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian authorities was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously . The alphabet in these books was based on the Latin alphabet and Ekavian Cyrillic in that situation. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was also an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not a matter of undemocratic unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and the Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of respect for both variants, and not of respect for Serbian. Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary of unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik was commissioned from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these events, the Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On May 20, 2018, marking the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again , this time accompanied by a critical analysis.
