over time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, beating prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The election took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead total was 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees at home and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and Nazary under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result , recognized as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed that no cabinet ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 2003 though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term as president. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were free and transparent. Rahmon's administration received further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for thousands of independent newspapers.
