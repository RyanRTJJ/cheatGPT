xi . Galdan was able to successfully evade the invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed by the Dzungar–Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. During this time he was awarded the title "Duke Haicheng" (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain or the Order of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Wang Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still in exile in and near Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared by their rebellion. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Republic of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were absorbed into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at the Battle of Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Zhou returned, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
