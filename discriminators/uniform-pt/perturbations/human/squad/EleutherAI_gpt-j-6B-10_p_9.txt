xi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's troops from these regions, which were then incorporated into Taiwan. Galdan was subsequently killed in the Dzungar–Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title "Duke Haicheng" (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had traveled to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui , the Grand Duke of Wushu and the Prince of Kuizhou Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived together in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living there in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile until finally they returned to mainland China where their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles in Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Some of the former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks . The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his successor, the Kangxi who were adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
