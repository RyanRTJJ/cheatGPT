 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, as well as Ekavian and Bosnian scripts. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while the rights to use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to draw up a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in the Croatian language, and in Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Novi Sad used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency differences and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which can only be considered proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian authors. And the Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Philological Society. Regardless of the controversy, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum reviewed the Declaration again in 2012, and offered a critical analysis.
