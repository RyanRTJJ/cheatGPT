 Sad Agreement, which in its first paragraph declared that "Serbs, Croats , and Papuans share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Kosice (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Russian be the name of the language , in official contexts, while in unofficial contexts traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists also argued that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Albanian language, which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and comfort. He further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both Croatian and Serbian , and emphasized in what ways they differed, which one can view as a gesture of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists later rejected those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philosophical Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals published the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Language in 1967. On the occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
