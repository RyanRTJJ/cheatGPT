 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in late August 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a series of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Service Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of Medicare for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at businesses and higher earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state -run television services and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different policy orientation relative to the keynesian economic approaches adopted by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 25 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Prime Minister’s economic policies, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on “the middle class in Australia’s cities”. The GST shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and was not supposed to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified by her infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some the turning point of the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Tony Hawke Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and auto billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
