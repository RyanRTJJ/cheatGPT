 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under an anti-inflation, anti-poverty spokesperson, John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of Social Security and Services , various changes to Medicare including the abolition of annual billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the lifting of strike awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income individuals, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of this document. Through the Prime Minister Paul Keating , the Liberals began a vigorous campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it reversed the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption burden. Pressure from group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led to calls for the government to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to fierce debate surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt ed from GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to Senator Keating was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as the high point in the Hewson campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the repeal in 1996 of unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
