 recession. The unemployment rate was 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Kerr in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare, the introduction of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolishment of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large portfolio of health and education services by state government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by the Coalition . In the 1980s, the 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the Fightback package. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it expanded the tax burden from direct taxation on the wealthy to indirect taxation such as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was among the things that led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and could be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous 'Hate Talks' telephone interview, considered by some as a big red herring in the election campaign. Keating was elected to a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most ly GST), while unemployment claims and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
