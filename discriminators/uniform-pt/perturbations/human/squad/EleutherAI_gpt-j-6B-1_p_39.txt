 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (Western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be understood as the language of the and official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked by government decree to produce a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb , in Belgrade in Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence for this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained on his website that only the television transmission from Italy used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency , duration and prestige. Babić further complained that the The Dictionary included side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not blatant unitarization. Moreover, Serbian linguists especially criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Society to their attention and made it a worldwide news of 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly Klub published the Declaration in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
