xi was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar–Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who later conquered Taiwan through his cession to Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title "Duke Haicheng" (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Chapter of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1632, the Prince of Ningjing yu and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still alive from Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops in Albazin were inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. It appears to have been an inspired idea. The Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first major diplomatic treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, sympathetic to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to influence the choice of the next Dalai Lama. The Chinese armed forces sent two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
