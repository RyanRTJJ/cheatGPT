 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and both Serbian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It not specified that Serbo-Croatian should be formally a language of the language in official contexts, while in everyday use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a group of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb under Cyrillic and Serbian under Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of discrimination. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the experts from Belgrade always used the word se<unk>et, which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever possible, which one can view as proof of respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for Croatian that were written by Serbian scholars and not Croatian. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik was provided by the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, the journal brought the Declaration on the Status and Function of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a new analysis.
