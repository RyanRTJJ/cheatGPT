; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five pieces of gold, "to bear his charges" : he refused them, saying, he might as easily put on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Constantius was made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard , where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he told Constantius that Athanasius was acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a man who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced by Liberius on every article, but being the more powerful, having infinite patience, ordered him to die, and Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, however, that he should comply with the bishops, then, at Corinth. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which was framed by the Arians at Sirmium.
