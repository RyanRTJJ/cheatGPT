 in 1991 and reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Margaret Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial pensions and the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at the upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the elimination of a large number of government owned businesses, representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the main policy item in the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from the hands of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a direct consumption tax. Pressure group and public opinion was relentless, which led to the government’s decision to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't taxed and exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday curse that was considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign, and how Labor won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Harper Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government. Some were adopted into law by successive governments (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Howard Liberal government.
