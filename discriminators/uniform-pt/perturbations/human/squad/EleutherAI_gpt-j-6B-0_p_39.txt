After the game of September 2, the Tigers record was 84-52 with the Mets in last place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just about a week after the Mets winning streak was snapped.

The Mets (who had won a record 120 games 7 -0) would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for being a
