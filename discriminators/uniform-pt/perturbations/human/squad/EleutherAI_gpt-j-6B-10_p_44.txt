In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a Kingdom of the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title "Duke Haicheng" (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan and were honored there, including the Prince of Hsin Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son s of Ming ruler Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning.

Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into Chinese Army. Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin.

They sent two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
