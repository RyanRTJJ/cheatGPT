 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John McDonnell that same November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to the health care system, the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, in the size of their businesses, an introductory limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to labour relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state subsidies and the privatisation of a large number of government package − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST became the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Government<unk>s Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he considered an attack against the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Competition and opposition from both business activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed consumption tax, leading to questions surrounding the complexity of understanding what was and wasn't tax exempt when charging GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Hewson, on the other hand, won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a lesser degree during the Keating Labor government, and to a higher extent during the Abbott Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
