; Beroea (Thrace). sent expensive presents, in case he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but he refused , that he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the people of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but they ordered them out. Constantius hereupon sent his followers under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Cicero, they boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every comment; the emperor, being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went to his friends. Constantius, after the banishment, went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his three ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. This was upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed that had been instituted by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). Athanasius knew what he wanted to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole mn in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
