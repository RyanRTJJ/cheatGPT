 Sad Agreement, which in its first paragraph stated that "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that were spoken around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and Croatian, Serb, and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian is the name of the language in official use had to be adopted for writing, and in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic and Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which he said had been adopted by Serbia but was not proof of unitarianism but of a preference for its use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) featured side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian languages where they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Serbian linguists. And finally, unitarism has always been ignored the fact that the material for the rječnik s was produced by the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly U<unk>an published it again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
