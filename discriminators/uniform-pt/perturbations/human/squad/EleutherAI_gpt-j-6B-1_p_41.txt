or The Vienna Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks speak a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement also established the equal status of Serbian and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. On 20 August 1949 the languages of Baranja and Matica were decided to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and in Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of discrimination— evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the translators from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which he believed implied linguistic superiority but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one may view as proof of careful respect for both dialects, not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Novi Sad Dictionary for being unitaristic which were not written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the money for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these difficulties, both Croatian and Croatian-Serbian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Progress of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again , accompanied by a critical analysis.
