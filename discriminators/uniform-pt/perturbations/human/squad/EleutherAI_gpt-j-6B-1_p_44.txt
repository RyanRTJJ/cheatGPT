 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two dialects that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern Serbian)." The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of both Croatian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian was the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the distinctive features of Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica serbiaca were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously with Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of subversion. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Kosovo used the Serbian alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić argues that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can regard as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of Serbian dialects for being unitaristic that were in Croatian . And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact , the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these factors, the intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On the occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly Vukovar published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
