 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of economic liberal measures , which included the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various reforms to Medicare including the abolition of capitation billing for non-concession holders, the same time, a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial laws and the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut for middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the elimination of a large number of government owned enterprises . The program was the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The implementation of GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating led this campaign against the Fightback package, a major plank against the GST, which he stated was an attack on the working class in that it would shift the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to withdraw some provisions from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from health and safety regulations. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to a confused electorate was illustrated by the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as the turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment compensation and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Hawke Labor government.
