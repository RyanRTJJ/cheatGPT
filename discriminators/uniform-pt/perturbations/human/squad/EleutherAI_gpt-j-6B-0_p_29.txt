After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was at 48 losses.

The Mets (who had lost a record 120 games 7 years earlier) would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for having lost a
