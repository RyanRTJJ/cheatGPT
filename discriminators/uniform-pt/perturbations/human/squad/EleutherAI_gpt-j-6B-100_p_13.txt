 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% . Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the Labour government published the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing to Medicare card holders, the introduction of a new nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending to eliminate state debt, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large section of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a new future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism of the previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the package. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Media, group activity and public opinion was relentless, pushing Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to controversy surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the tax. The difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a low point in the election campaign. Keating won second fifth and a three-year term at the 1993 election. A number these proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Rudd Liberal government (most famously through privatisation), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
