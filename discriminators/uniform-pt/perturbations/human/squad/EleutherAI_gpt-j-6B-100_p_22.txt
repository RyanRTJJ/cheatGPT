 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", non-emergency economic measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to the banking sector, including the introduction of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a 30 percent minimum wage, significant cuts on unemployment benefits, various changes to labor relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in education tax cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the adoption of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. A 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy and in 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a vigorous campaign against the Liberal/National Coalition and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in order to shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt from taxation the top three employers − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in appealing to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake election incident of 1983, seen by some as a turning point in the election campaign. He lost a third consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were signed in to law in the Rudd Labor government, to a lesser extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
