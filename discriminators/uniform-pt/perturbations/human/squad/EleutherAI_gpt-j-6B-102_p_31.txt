The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children , children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by teachers and paid for by the students.

The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for modern schooling. Madison County was one of the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed the first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer months and did not end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Marie Raymond. She was a 25-year-old Missourian who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was soon teaching 50 to 60 students each week to one of the 81 students at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching after one year, but would later become Madison County superintendent of schools.
