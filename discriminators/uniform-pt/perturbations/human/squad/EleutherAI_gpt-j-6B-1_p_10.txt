 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Slovenes speak a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Belgrade (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together to produce an encyclopedic dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was appointed to prepare a pravopis. During 1908 both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not primarily a matter of uniformity, but of frequency of use . Babić further complained that the Novi Sad University listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful attention to both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those passages in the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the English Literary Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On the occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published it in 2007, and again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
