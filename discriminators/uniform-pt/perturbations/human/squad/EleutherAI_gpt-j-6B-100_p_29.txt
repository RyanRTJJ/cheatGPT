 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1988. Under the leadership of Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! campaign − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare , abolition of bulk purchases for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the introduction of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and high income earners, $10 billion in spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the Government’s policy of a different future direction to the economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an extension of the protections for the working class in Australia would have shifted part of the capital burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST and open the door to questions surrounding the in 1992 when the GST Commissioner was uncertain as to what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a defining moment in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the National Australia Plan was later adopted in to law in some instances but only adopted to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the Howard Labor-led Government). New unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
