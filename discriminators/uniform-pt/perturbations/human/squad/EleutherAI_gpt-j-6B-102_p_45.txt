 as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The first students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Walter W. Brown. The first early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Territorial Legislative Congress held its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to collect taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school was scheduled to be opened for students in Jefferson City in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had returned to Virginia City to train as a teacher. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of another second year teacher, Mrs. Raymond was responsible for teaching 45 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah Farley was retired the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
