 Sad Agreement, which went into effect in 1992. Its first conclusion stated: "The Serbs and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants which have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement confirmed the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian languages should be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Latin at Dubrovnik, Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet the Serbs now claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The facts of this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television in Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and repetition. Babi<unk> further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from the Croatian and Slovene variants wherever they differed, which many linguists accepted on this view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni list came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals received the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1955. On the occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly magazine Zrinjevt published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
