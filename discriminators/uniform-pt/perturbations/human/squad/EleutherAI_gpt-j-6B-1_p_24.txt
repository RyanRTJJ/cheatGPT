 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins speak a single language with two equal variants that are concentrated around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the language of the language in Serbia, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be combined. Thus hrvatska and srpska were set to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian reaction was that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from the Vatican used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of linguistic appropriation but of frequency of use and prestige. Babi<unk> also complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as an indication of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian scholars used those parts of the Dictionary for Serbs that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik was supplied by the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatia’s intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Society into existence in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by an analysis.
