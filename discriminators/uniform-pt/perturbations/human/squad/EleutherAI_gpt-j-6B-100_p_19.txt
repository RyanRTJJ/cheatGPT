 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1991. Following the resigned speech by Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of special treatment for non-concession holders, introduction of a nine-month limit on benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax on wealth, a large reduction in employment tax, targeted at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state aid and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a change of future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the only GST introduced under the 1992 budget. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the economic plan, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure from the left and right was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the income tax − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the voters was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a fifth consecutive five-way tie for Minister at the 1993 election. A number of these were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor Government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a variety of new taxpayers in the form of the Abbott Liberal government.
