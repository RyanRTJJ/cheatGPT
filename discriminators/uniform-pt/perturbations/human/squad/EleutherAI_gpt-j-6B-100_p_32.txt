 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1990. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page manifesto, document − The New Zealand Constitution 2001<unk> featuring a collection of economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including removal of awards, the introduction of a $1 billion personal income tax levied at middle and upper income earners, significant in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing more of a shift in future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was a centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback policy and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation on ogrees and the wealthy to indirect taxation in the form of a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion campaigning followed, which led Hewson to exempt food from the GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of their situation in a time before fresh food was known to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous Fox News interview, seen by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Liberal government (including the NTFS) and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
