The elections took place shortly after the end of . The country and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbers were around 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were displaced within and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial appointments to go to the opposition. Elections were called on 23 July 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with the majority of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Erdogan (66% to 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 parliamentary elections, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) did not observe although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the independence movements. OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses , leading to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.
