xi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the Qing Empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar–Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had originally conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title "Duke Haicheng" (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he returned to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga i in 1661-1662, including the Prince s Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived under the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile . Some of their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles at the far eastern outpost of Nerchinsk (now part of China) in the interior of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Nerchinsk. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, closely connected to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two troops to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
