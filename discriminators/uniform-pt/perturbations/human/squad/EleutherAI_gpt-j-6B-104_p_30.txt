 this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the country than in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Mohamed Sabah in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place at the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of chaos. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a compromise was reached between Rahmon and opposition forces, under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The deal also guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States and the United Nations claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for censorship and tax violations of the media sector. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.
