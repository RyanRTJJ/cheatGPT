 as families started settling into the new areas. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the homes for Indian children. The first formal school on the east coast started at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Mr. Dimsdale in Virginia City . In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1859. It was the first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public education in Virginia City. Stafford County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in May 1863. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran from September through summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had come from Baltimore to Virginia City via wagon around 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of her assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each week, out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no English or French books used in the school. In their place was a selection of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit the staff the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
