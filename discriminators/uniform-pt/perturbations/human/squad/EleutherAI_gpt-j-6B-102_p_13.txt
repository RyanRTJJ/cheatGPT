 as the Indians began settling into the area. The first schools were small subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were held under the leadership of Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school children charged $1.75 per week. The Virginia Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for the future state's schooling. Madison County was soon to take advantage of the new taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. Sarah Raymond was a native of Virginia who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 minutes a day out of the 240 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $80 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used at the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Mrs. Farley began teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
