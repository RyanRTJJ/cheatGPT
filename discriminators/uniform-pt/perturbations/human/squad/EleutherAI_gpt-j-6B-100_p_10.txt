 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1992, the New Zealand opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes in fuel allocation, including the abolition of public transport billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a maximum annual limit on unemployment benefits, a radical change to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cuts directed at middle and upper class Americans, about $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced under previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 7.5 percent GST was not part of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating launched a very extensive campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an unfair taxation of the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from the wealth of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group Greenpeace also sought to shape public opinion <unk> which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and could be said to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in relating to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record four Labor seats in the 1992 election and the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted into law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most significantly through the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
