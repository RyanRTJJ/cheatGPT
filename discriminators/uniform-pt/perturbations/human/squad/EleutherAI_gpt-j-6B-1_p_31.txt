as the Srem Agreement, and in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats , and Slovenes share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be combined. Matica hrvatska and Matica serbska were invited to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian experts was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in their original Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet the government and media claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from the Novi Sad used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of uniform use and prestige. Babić further accused the Novi Sad Dictionary included, side by side , words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized several authors of the Novi Sad Dictionary as being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the main funding for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals still published the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. Despite this, on the occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
