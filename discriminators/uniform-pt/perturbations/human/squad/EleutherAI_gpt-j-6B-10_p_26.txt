xi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the reconstructed land of what was eventually known as the Dzungar–Qing Basin. In the year 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title "Duke Haicheng" (海澄公) and inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Wuzhi and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to the mainland, where they spent the rest of their lives . The deaths were justified since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for against the Qing were recruited by the imperial authorities for battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers , known as the Golden Ring, like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian forces in Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of the Tibetan province of Lhasa, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
