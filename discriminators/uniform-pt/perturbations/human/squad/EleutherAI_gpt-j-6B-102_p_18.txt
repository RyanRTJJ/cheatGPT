 as families started to move into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school building was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen's residents. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. The first subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this public school pupils were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its formal opening in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it established the first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school in Virginia City was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening in July. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers to teach at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train to work on the farm. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid the small fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by other students. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become superintendent of Madison County public schools.
