xi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these provinces, which were then incorporated into his own empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the war. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title "Duke Haicheng" (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Noble Family (<unk>) when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Zheng to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Taiwan until 1681. Chen Qing sent the 17 princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of attacks over Albazin, the far ne of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners and used by them against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept negotiations on the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi led armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
