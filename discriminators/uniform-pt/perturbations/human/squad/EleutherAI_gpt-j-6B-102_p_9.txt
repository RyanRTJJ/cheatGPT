 as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school of record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children , children of Fort Owen Army and their wives. The first school term started in the month of April 1862 and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was founded by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislature had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take benefit of the newly created school-tax levy and it formed fhe first public school in the Madison region in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in order to become a certified teacher, becoming a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain her teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 300 students enrolled at the school. Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Sarah was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching after a year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of public schools.
