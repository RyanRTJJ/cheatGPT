 Sad Agreement, in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language , constituted of equal variants of a dialect which has developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)." The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial contexts traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on similar lines and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the linguists from Belgrade always used the Serbian alphabet— which was true, but was not a problem of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants when they differed, which one can view as one careful research of both variants, and not as unitaristic. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the concept for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of the situation, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Development of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On the occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
