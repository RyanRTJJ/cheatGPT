 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two dialectal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of the two Latin scripts, as well as Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the distinctions between Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were printed in Serbian Cyrillic in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Vuk Babi<unk> complained that the majority of writing from Novi Sad used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they occur and this one can view as evidence of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian scholars have attacked even those parts of the Novi Sad Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the rječnik came from the American Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the 45th anniversary, the Croatian Literature Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
