 as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription only, typically beginning in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot County beginning in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until March. Classes were taught by Mr. Benjamin Scott until May 19. An early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes , which set the foundations for public education in the county. Fairfax County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Mrs. Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled from Kansas City by train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of her first year teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $10 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
