 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Jews speak a single language with two equal variants that have their centres in Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Romani pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the sole official language of the and official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare Serbian entries. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that such suppression was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is often rather patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babi<unk> complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian words wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for the differences and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, the Dictionary ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Based on these facts, Croatian intellectuals signed the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th year, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Pravopisni rje<unk>nik in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
