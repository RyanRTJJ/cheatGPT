xi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these territories, and these were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Dzungar–Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Bao Jin, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base during the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the "Tan Long Haicheng" (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Huilong or Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, also lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. Kangxi sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives , since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers , like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight h Party used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Albazin marked China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border open for the better part of two centuries. Upon Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to effect the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
