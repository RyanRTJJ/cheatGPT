 Sad Agreement, which entered into force on 8 May 1991. Its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a common language with two dialects that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official use; in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a vocabulary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the same period two standard books were published simultaneously , prepared according to Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic and Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence for this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Ivan Babi<unk> complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed the side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can take as proof of respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. When it came to unitarism, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material was not the material of the Weekly Journal Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 50th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
