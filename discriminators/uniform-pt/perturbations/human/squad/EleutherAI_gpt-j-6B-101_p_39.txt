to Liberius (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five pounds of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did reject this and another like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to find all the presents in Sardica, but Liberius threw them away; Liberius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had died at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of a serious crime. The emperor was reduced to tears on every article, but being the supreme example of patience, ordered him into banishment. He sent Constantius into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The bishop wished in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the letter of Athanasius, and a modified the famous creed which had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he stood for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret reported (Leh. Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the Creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, became Bishop of Alexandria in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
