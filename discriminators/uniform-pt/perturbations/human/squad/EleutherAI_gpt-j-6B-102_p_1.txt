when families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in the Columbia valley in February 1753. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until March. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school pupils were charged $1.75 for the whole year and $16 for each individual student. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the stage for the start of public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in May 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until it had to close. The school's first school year ran through August 8 and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to America via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test from home and paid the fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled in the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of a month, and Mrs. Sarah paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the children in November, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
