 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the government's reform policy document − a package of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), changes to public sector pension scheme concession structures, the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the privatisation of the Australian Communications Industry, $13 billion personal income tax cuts aimed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different direction to the keynesian economic policies embraced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The introduction of the GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating led the campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation – a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group input from public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST . In response to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't actually exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exposed by the infamous birthday card, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth and final term at the 1993 election. A number of the law was later adopted in to law sometime in an edited form, to a small extent during the Keating Liberal government and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
