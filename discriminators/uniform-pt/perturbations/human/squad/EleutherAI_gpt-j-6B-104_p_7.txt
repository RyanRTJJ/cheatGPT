 this time because of persecution, increased poverty or limited economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The presidential elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between the government and opposition parties under the auspices of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a ceasefire praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of the vote would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (83% of the popular vote versus 79% of the proportional vote) and he began his third term in office. The two opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign newspapers and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the suspension or cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.
