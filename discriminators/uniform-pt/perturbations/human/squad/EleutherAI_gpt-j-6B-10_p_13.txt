xi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the 1660s. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from the grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered it from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title of Grand Master of the Han Imperial Period (海澄公) and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Banner of the Five Great Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui , Ming Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Emperor Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the remainder of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Kublai, which encircled the main city of Kublai, Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were inducted into the Eight Banners and used by the Qing against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border open for the better part of two centuries. On Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
