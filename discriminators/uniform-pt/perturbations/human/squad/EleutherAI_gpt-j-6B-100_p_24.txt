 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under the leadership of Dr Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a package of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including introduction of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion in tax cut directed at middle income and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state -owned enterprises and the privatisation of a large number of departments around federal government owned enterprises − representing something of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister James Clarke mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and in particular against the GST, which he described as an attack on the middle class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group attacks and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to withdraw from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the direction of GST. Keating won a record fifth four-year term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a lesser extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the system of unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted from that time by the Abbott Liberal government.
