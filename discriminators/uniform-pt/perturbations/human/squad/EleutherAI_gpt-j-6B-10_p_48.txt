xi Emperor was able to successfully expel Qing forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galdan was eventually killed in the Civil War. In 1683, Qing forces won the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base for the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title "Duke Haicheng" by the Han Emperor and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Guards as the second of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where he is still a chief in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing Emperor sent 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan in 1683 back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern city by the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Eight Banners Corps of the Army sent by the Qing against the Russian troops at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European s and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. After Galdan's death, his followers, as adherents to Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the election of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and elected a new Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
