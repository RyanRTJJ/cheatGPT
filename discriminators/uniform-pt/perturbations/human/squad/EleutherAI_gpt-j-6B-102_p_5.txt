 as families started settling into the area. The first schools were informal schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were the family children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and remained open until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana General Assembly had its inaugural session in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Virginia County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it paid for the first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train . To become a certified teacher in that state, she took a test in her home and paid their fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day from among the 81 students enrolled at her school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In its place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Mrs. Farley began teaching the following year, where she would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
