-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Giants. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series to the Cardinals, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who were in third place).

The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next evening in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally lost all phases of the game. The Mets (who had lost a record 120 games eight days earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for having lost a
