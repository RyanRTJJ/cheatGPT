-hitter on August 19, and the White Sox’s advantage over the other teams grew to 5 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Sox’s record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as the winning started just as the losing was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place).

The Mets (who had lost a record 120 + regular-season games just three years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable record, would be remembered for having lost a
