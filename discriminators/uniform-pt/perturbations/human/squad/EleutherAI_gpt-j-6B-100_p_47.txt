 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under leader Michael Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! manifesto − a radical collection of policy positions, which included liberal plans for economic reform like the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to tax laws including the abolition of a $13 billion personal income tax credit aimed at helping lower and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises , the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 th National Policy Statement was the centerpiece of this policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the 15th National policy package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the individual to indirect taxation as a broad-based charge. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led to an agreement to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to public confusion surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be classified by the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake controversy, considered by some as a turning point in the prevailing election campaign. Keating was re-elected to a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor administration (most of the GST), and to a larger extent during the Howard Labor administration (most of the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
