 this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon took power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Ahmad Badru in a general election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead toll was more than 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised by international observers, in 1991, making it a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 78% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties supported the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Organisation of American Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites , implemented paper tax inspections on independent printing houses , which led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.
