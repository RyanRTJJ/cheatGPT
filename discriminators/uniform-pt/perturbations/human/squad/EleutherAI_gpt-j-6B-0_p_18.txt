-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the National League Division Series on September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then the losing streak began just as the Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would eventually finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs were tied 2-2 going into the ninth inning.

Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After the Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had to settle for second place at 85-57. The Mets would never look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning played a superior game on defense and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game. The Mets (who had appeared in a record 120 games 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for having lost a
