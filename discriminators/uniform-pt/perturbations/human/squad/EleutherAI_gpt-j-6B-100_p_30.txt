 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in 1993 the opposition government developed its 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic proposals including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the introduction of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of collective bargaining, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and high earners, $14 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the freezing of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism of the previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul ine Hanson waged a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly the 15 percent GST, which he described as, was an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which eventually led to measures to exempt food from the consumption tax − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty describing this to the electorate was exemplified in the lemon cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive term at the 1993 federal election, with a record number , and health bills and the GST. Many such proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a lesser extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits , health billing and medical billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
