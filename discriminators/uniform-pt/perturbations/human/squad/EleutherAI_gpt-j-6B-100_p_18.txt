 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the Government released the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical , supposedly "dry", economic reform including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including changes to the rules on the termination of awards, a $13 billion income tax cut for middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in business tax cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very clear new direction against the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of this document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a major campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class and that it shifted the tax burden from the direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. The resistance from group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt China from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was evident in the infamous birthday cake interview, seen by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law , and at last put into effect in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most notably the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
