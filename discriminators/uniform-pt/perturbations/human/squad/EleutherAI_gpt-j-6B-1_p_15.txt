 Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with the exception of Ekavian variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Zagreb pronunciations. It also stated that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, but in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on both books and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to publish a single dictionaries. At the end of the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in 1963. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission s always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side the words in both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can see as proof of respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. However, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Activities of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On the occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in its original version accompanied by a critical analysis.
