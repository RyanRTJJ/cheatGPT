 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in October 1992 the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax, various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to pension schemes including the abolition of awards, a $130 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large amount of non-essential state sector government owned enterprises , marking the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism of the previous New Zealand governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through his leadership role in the Government, Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation on the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public support was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the tax. <unk> − <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> questions surrounding the complexity of what was and wasn't to be exempt from it. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate in Queensland was noted in a 1994 television program; in particular, the birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a larger number of people during the Abbott Liberal government.
