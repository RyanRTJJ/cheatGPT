; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the charges; but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might only lay them on his flatters; as he did not receive any like present from the Lord. How did the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Constantius was made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent Liberius under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he informed Constantius that he had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators , thieves and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to on one hand, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to live. This was his twentieth year of the papacy. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, who had set up a special court. He subscribed the condemnation of slavery in a confession or creed which had been presented by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared it the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the creed. Constantius was the king. Consantius, the son of Arian, became sole ruler of Rome at the death of his brother, Constans.
