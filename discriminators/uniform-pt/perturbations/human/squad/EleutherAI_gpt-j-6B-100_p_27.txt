 recession. Unemployment hit 8.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in February 1993 the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the introduction of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $3 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes , the privatisation of a number of government owned businesses, representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, then Finance Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and , ultimately, the GST, which he described as a burden on the working class and that moved the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity to persuade Hewson to change public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was considered to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in relating to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a second consecutive Labor term at the polls in 2003. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a smaller extent during the Howard government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing from healthcare were deemed necessary for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
