on Language Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single vernacular with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Beograd (eastern)." The agreement insisted on the use of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to remain in place. The Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were asked to work together on a dictionary, and a committee composed of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the 1950s both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in 1967. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Serbian alphabet— which was unrelated to the war— but said it was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency control and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both Croatian and Serbian varieties wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those entries in the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the American Croatian Society. Regardless of these facts, this publication still brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration on 28 March 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
