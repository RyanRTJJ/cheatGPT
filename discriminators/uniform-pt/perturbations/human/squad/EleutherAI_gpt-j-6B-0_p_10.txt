-hitter on August 19, and the division lead was extended to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the games of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Cardinals in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to face the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in second place in the National League North). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning.

The error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets were back ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back.

The Mets (who had lost their previous 120 games 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, who ended the year with a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for having lost a
