 this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better medical and medical care in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in the November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections were held in October 1991, shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The dead numbered over 100,000. A total of three million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. On a day in 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as the most successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and UN observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with more than 28% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although an official from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections of printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities of a number of independent newspapers.
