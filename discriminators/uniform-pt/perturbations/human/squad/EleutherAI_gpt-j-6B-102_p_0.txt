 as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school established on record was in 1858 at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley . The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only had lunch on February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its first meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to pay tax for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Madison County and had it opened in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but was postponed its opening until March. The first class ran through the spring, but didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via Philadelphia in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was soon teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the nearly 600 children enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Harnard paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by Madison County immigrants and emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
