; Beroea (Thrace). He also promised him presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" if his enemy refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a gift from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, had endeavored to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius would not allow them to get out. Constantius hereupon sent Liberius under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had made an inroad at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it would be unjust to condemn a person , who would not be convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into limbo and went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The bishop disposed in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. This process included the decree of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been received by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as he read it (Theodoret, Hist. lib. , 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius was the Emperor, son of Arian, became sole ruler in Rome after the death of his brother, Constans.
