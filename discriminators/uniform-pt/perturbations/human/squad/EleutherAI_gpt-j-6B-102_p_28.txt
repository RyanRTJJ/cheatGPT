The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly held its inaugural meeting in 1864. The territorial legislature authorized an ordinance that would levy taxes for schools, which set the stage for the establishment of public schooling. Virginia City was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening in 1864. The first school year ran through the summer and continued until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via Philadelphia in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test on her way home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 200 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate $50 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the classroom at that time, in their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah Farley was given notice the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
