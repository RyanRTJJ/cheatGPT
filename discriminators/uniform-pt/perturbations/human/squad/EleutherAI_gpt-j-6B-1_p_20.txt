 Sad Agreement, and its first conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two variants that have developed in Salonica (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal use of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in the private sphere the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. The Academy of Science and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian language scientists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian citizens allege that it was an act of racism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Prime Minister Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but rather one of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed the Serbian side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever possible, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, no one criticized the parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the publications of the Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Language in 1967. As part of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the public journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
