 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Through a number of hard-left politicians, including former Premier John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of public billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial tribunals and the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and high income individuals, $21 billion in government spending cuts, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian tax cuts practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, then against the GST, which he launched an attack on the working class in that he wanted to shift the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public demand were relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST − leading to some 4 million people not purchasing the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the voters was exemplified in his birthday cake . That incident is seen by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Liberal government (social security reform) and to a large extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and the welfare reform proposal were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
