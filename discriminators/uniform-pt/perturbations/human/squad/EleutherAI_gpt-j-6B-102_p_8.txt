 as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held their classes at the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children or the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was among the first to take advantage of the new taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until January of 1860. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman called Mary Ann, who traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test for teaching. She arrived home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to receive her teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled in school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 , and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 . There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become the District superintendent of schools.
