 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Dr John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition launched its Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures. They included the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to the agricultural market <unk> including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $10 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper class Americans, $10 billion in government spending cuts, the removal of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government owned enterprises − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Labor governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the Prime Minister's 2015 document. Through his campaigning strategy, Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the rich in that it shifted the burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion eventually led to the legislation, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed tax, leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't considered exempt from the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the dispute between Hewson and Keating , which eventually led to a record fifth consecutive Labor term in the 1993 election. A number of the changes were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and tax billing were re-targeted for a time during the Abbott Liberal government.
