; Beroea (Thrace). He sent expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" if he would refused them, saying, he might as well give him some presents on his flatters; as he did also a like thing to the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of Christ (Philippians 3:11). Plans were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out.
