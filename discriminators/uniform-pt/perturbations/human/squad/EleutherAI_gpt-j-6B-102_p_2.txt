The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The first students attending public schools were Indian children and the first teachers were Fort Owen employees.

The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for education and set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia on May 28, 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Elizabeth Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in gold dust and a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 children each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In a class there was an assortment of books brought in by the teachers for the students. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but she continued to become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
