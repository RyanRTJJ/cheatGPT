 Sad Agreement, which in its first paragraph read "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and the distinction between Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the official language of the language in official contexts, and in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to retain their usage. The schools of Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in a kind of Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— this was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but just a matter of use . Stjepan Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not from unitarism. Moreover, Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Novi Sad Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists. And finally, Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian intellectuals adopted the Declaration on the Status and Name of Croatian as an International Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the Declaration’s 50th anniversary, the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration in 2012, accompanied by a critical analysis.
