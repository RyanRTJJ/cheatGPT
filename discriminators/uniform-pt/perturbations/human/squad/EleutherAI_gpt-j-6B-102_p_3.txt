 people started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription and were typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. In 1886, the first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Mr. Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were paid $100 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed the first public school system starting in Madison City in 1886. The first school was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The school year ran through the summer and didn't start until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 100 students each day out of the 200 students already enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place were an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah Farley would leave the school the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.
