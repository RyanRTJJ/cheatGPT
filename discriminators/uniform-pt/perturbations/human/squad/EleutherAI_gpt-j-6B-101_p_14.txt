; Beroea (Thrace). He sent him expensive presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent from Berlin five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" but Liberius refused them, saying, he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the royal house for the Arian and Roman emperors to believe in Christ and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in the church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon followed him under strict guard to Milan, where, in a conference recorded by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor refused to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered his banishment. Liberius went into exile for three months, and after two years went to Rome , died in the twentieth year of his own, several ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the canons of Athanasius, and a confession or creed that had been framed by the Arians at Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the Creed of Niceae, as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor , however, believed whatever he wished to believe. So did the bishops at Niceae. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius , an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
