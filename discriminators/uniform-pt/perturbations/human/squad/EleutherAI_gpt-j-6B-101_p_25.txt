; Beroea (Thrace). He also offered him other presents, too, if he were to accept the Arian position but were refused. He sent him, indeed, five hundred pieces of gold "to bear gifts; but Liberius refused them, saying he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the King and his wife -- that the messenger learn to believe in Christ, but did not cease to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the Jews in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius was sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where, in a dream interpreted by Theodoret, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, as it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more incapable of patience, ordered the banishment. Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after having been exiled, went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies of his province were writing to him a letter saying to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or confession that had been framed by the women of Sirmium. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared that he would not do much more than the Creed , as Theodoret testifies. (Theodoret, Ing., ii. c. 249) The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.
