 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Chief Minister John Hewson, in November 1991, the opposition released the 650-page Fightback! policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures including the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to the employment law, the abolition of bulk billing for mortgage holders, the introduction of a 15 percent cap on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, $10 billion in government spending, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the elimination of a large number of government package − representing the start of a different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy document. Through 1992, Labor Prime Minister Paul ine Hanson led a campaign against the Fightback package, and for the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxes on the wealthy to indirect tax on a broad-based consumption sector. The lobby group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST in response to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be added to the GST. Hewson's difficulty in explaining himself to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake comment seen by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term in the 1993 election. A number of the proposals were later adopted in NSW in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal government (most significantly the GST), although some additional programs to replace tax benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
