xi Emperor was able to successfully expel Galdan's invading army from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. Galadz was eventually killed in the Dzungar–Qing War. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Taiwan from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Tang Jianshi, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Zheng Keshuang was awarded the title "The Great Haicheng" and was inducted into the Han Chinese Plain Red Squadron of the Eight Banners when he moved to Beijing. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661-1662, including the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai, where they lived in the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes to serve on Taiwan after which Kangxi and Kangxi fled back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives . The 17 Ming princes became heroes since their lives were spared from execution. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi's forces for series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern frontier of the Tsardom of Russia. Zheng's former soldiers on Taiwan like the rattan shield troops were also inducted into the Chinese Army under the Banners and used by the Chinese in attacks against the Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China's first formal treaty with a European power and kept the conflict close for the better part of 100 years. After Galdan's death, his followers, as well as the scholars of Tibetan Buddhism, attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.
