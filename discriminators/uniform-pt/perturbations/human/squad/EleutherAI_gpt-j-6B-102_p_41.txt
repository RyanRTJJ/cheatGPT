 Indians contacted each other and started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian s and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until January 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia on April 26, 1863. In this school students were charged $9 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for county schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the new taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City , a town in Madison County. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening . The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train from New York. To become a teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid the $6 fee in gold dust to receive her teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 300 enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by the emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later graduate from Madison without one of schools.
