 Sad Agreement, which in its conclusion stated: "Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that there should be a bilingual education system of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to be combined on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. In the sixties both books were published in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Some Croatian linguists claim that this policy was an attempt to circumvent unitarianism. The evidence supporting this claim is patchy: Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true, but was not proof of unequal rights, but of frequency of use and prestige. Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary (1967) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed, which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants, and not of unitarism. Moreover, no one has ever criticized those parts of the Dictionary as being unitaristic that were not actually accepted by Croatian linguists. And finally, the Dictionary ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society. Regardless of these facts, Croatian writers and thinkers published the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967. On occasion of the publication’s 45th anniversary, the Croatian weekly Prijedor published the Declaration again , this time accompanied by a critical analysis.
