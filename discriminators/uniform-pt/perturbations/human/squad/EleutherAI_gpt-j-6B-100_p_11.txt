 recession. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992. Under Prime Minister John Hewson, in November 1991, Labour launched the Coalition's first policy document − a radical collection of "dry", economic liberal measures . These included the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of strike awards, a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and lower income earners, $10 billion in government pensions, the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government and financial hegemony − representing the start of a very different future direction to the keynesian economic conservatism of previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centerpiece of the policy implementation package. In 1992, Labor Prime Minister Bill Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback package, and particularly against the GST, which he described as an attack on the working class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxes on the wealthy to consumption taxes, disguised as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity and public opinion was relentless, which led Hewson to change the food rules in his proposed GST − leading to questions surrounding the complexity of what food was and wasn't to be exempt from the Act. Keating's difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive Labor term at the 1993 election, with a number of the proposals were later adopted in the Australian government in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Liberal government (the GST) and to a larger extent during the Howard Liberal Government (most famously the GST), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Abbott Liberal government.
