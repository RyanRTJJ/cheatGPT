 Iranian defence forces recently conducted "cruise-missile tests" targeting US Navy vessels in the Gulf.

The US imposed sanctions on Iran following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but the UN oil embargo did not take effect until 1981, a full 28 years ago.

At the time, Iran said the UN sanctions had done nothing to damage its economy and said its oil would continue to flow as it had done until the first official sanctions were introduced. The US now says it has an ally in Iran, despite Tehran's hardline stance on some issues.

Tehran was the subject of a UN security council resolution last year over its nuclear programme, which the nuclear watchdog said was "based on the assumption that Iran has the ability, if necessary, to produce plutonium" for bombs.

An Iranian state television report said Iran's navy would resume exercises next week. Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif said Iran was developing a new submarine.

Fahdollah Pourvari, the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards navy, did not give details.

"For a long time now we have been practising a variety of naval exercises that are all aimed at carrying out our security plan," he told the IRNA news agency.

"During this time people's attention will be on Iran's nuclear programme. But we want to show the world and the international community that Iran is a responsible and stable country."

He described the Gulf, which includes the Strait of Hormuz, as "the most important artery in both time and space, and its protection and supply through Iran would be an important factor for security and for peace".

A senior commander in Iran's Revolutionary Guards' navy told NBC News that Iran had conducted a test of the same "long-range ballistic missile" but did not give details. Iran has not confirmed the test.

Western allies, Iran's regional archrivals, condemned the test as a violation of international law.

The Israeli defence ministry said the launch was of a short-range missile from southwest Iran into "Arabian Gulf waters" that would not have reached Israel's territory.

The US, Britain, France, Russia and Germany called for a full UN condemnation.
