 arrested in Belfast in 1972 by the Special Branch.

Mr Fenton was found with 20 bullet wounds on March 19 1972 in the former site of the Royal Ulster Constabulary station on Belfast Street.

Since Mr Fenton's death the police have been forced to confront the secret operations that took place in Northern Ireland during those years and to answer questions as to why people like Martin and Ms Ryan have been allowed to escape.

Both were members of the UDR paramilitary unit, the 'Brickbangers', whose members targeted opponents of the IRA.

They claimed at the time that they had been targeted because they were loyal supporters of the Provisional Government.

This was the same claim made by Martin and Ms Ryan when they claimed they were the victims of false imprisonment.

During the trial it was suggested that the two had planted a gun under Mr Fenton's seat and he had been attacked by them. In this allegation the prosecution relied on evidence provided by a former MI5 agent, Derek Redmond.

Mr Redmond claimed that Martin and Ms Ryan, both members of the UDR paramilitary unit, the 'Brickbangers', had set up and installed the gun and put Mr Fenton in a position where he had to surrender.

However, his evidence was criticised by the prosecution and they did not call him as a witness. It has now emerged, however, that he gave a statement to a police officer in 1992 that he did not make and that the defence team, after a series of appeals, had not challenged the evidence.

The disclosure was made by Sgt Jim McDonagh to an investigating officer in 1992 which led to the review of the case.

Mr Redmond later made a statement to PSNI officers. This stated that the "facts appeared to suggest that the two were trying to avoid an arrest and were trying to make an example out of Mr Fenton".

Mr Redmond told detectives that he had been approached
