Thank you for your time and reading! Here's to writing better stories and less about the drama in my own marriage!

Writing Prompt: [ FF ( ) ] "The weapons that changed the world" (Feedback for every response.)


__________________________________________________

Note: These are all stories I like to play but they will likely fall under the same genre (Romance, Science Fiction, Adventure, etc.)


I don't claim ownership over the character or the plot and the pictures above belong to me and my wife.


**Note for female:

I would encourage you to explore your creative space and show some restraint. You can start a fanfiction and then use the stories as the inspiration for your own original stuff. If you see that something isn't working for you, you can always start another story :)

[FF]


"The weapon that won the war" is a two-part story. If you have an understanding of this format read part 1 first.

Once you are familiar with the format or plan to be familiar, please read part 2. It will have several characters and you can still use it as a foundation for your own original story, just with different characters.

Also note when you click read you will be taken to another prompt where you will be able to specify if you want the rest of your story to be part of that prompt only. For the love of god don't be lazy or ask for an extension.
