 thought the deaths of the police officer and the taxi driver, who remained with the group for a time after the robbery and assault, would have resulted in further violence.


A senior Scotland Yard source said: "There was an element of surprise on the ground." Two officers were hospitalised and one of them was on life support.

He added: "I know the group of suspects were aware they had left some bodies behind them."

The source said that the group had been watching for the transport police to arrive.

The officer who has been hospitalised was the first on the scene and has already undergone surgery. He has suffered head trauma, including multiple fractures to his skull and facial fractures. The officer who remains in hospital is believed to be seriously disfigured.

The police source said: "We do expect they are very upset by what happened to them but they remain unrepentant."

He added: "We have no evidence of any links between the victims and any of the suspects."

Two women were arrested at the scene and taken to a police station.

London mayor Boris Johnson tweeted: "Shocked to hear about the dreadful, sad news of the death of two Metropolitan Police officers yesterday in Khartoum."

Scotland Yard announced that two officers had been taken to hospital with injury but were now out of danger.

The force had earlier warned of "an escalation" of violent incidents in the capital.

Officers will remain in place at all Tube stations on a permanent basis and are urging members of the public to remain alert and report any suspicious activity. Anyone with information can call the Met's witness or fraud line on 080044 5025 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: "We have reached out to Khartoum to offer any assistance we can provide in relation to this tragic incident. Our thoughts are with the families of the two police officers who passed away.

"We can confirm the UK has offered medical assistance and consular assistance in connection with this incident."
