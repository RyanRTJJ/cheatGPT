-year-old has been in a rehabilitation centre for eight months.

As an athlete, you want to be able to be on a bike at the next Olympics and train afterwards

Rupp says he doesn't have that much time, and it is unlikely the U.S. will make the team for 2020 - not without Rupp winning.

"It's unfortunate that it has all caught up with me, it is not something I wanted to happen. But it is what it is and there's nothing I can do to make it better," he said earlier this year.

"I know that I've done enough during these eight months to make the team in Beijing. But it is always tough when people look at what you are going through in the past eight months and they judge you like that.

"As an athlete, you want to be on a bike at the next Olympics and train afterwards."

Rupp made his name in the world indoor championships in Beijing in 2007.

After an amazing first heat, Rupp was second to eventual gold medallist Tyson Gay in the final.

He continued on to win the 200m in a personal best time of 19.85, which was then set again by Britain's Chris Sutton in a time of 20.24 (20.30).

Rupp then became the first male sprinter to win gold in the 100m.

He also won the 100 and 200 in the same race.

Rupp's world record of 19.91sec was beaten only once, by the British David Rudisha who clocked 19.92.

In a career that has lasted nine years and covered almost every major marathon distance, Rupp has won the New York, Boston and Chicago marathons.

However Rupp doesn't see running as his favourite sport. Instead, he relishes the idea of returning to the track - on foot, of course.
