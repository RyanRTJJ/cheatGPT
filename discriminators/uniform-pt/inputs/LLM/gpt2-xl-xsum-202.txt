Lorna told The Times that her brother had not talked about any problems with drugs, and that he was "happy and healthy".

She said: "Chris was so positive and he had a sense of humour. There was no reason to think that he would do something like this."

Another sister, Lucy, said in a video message posted on Facebook: "I'm going to miss him every day. He was a fantastic little brother, I'm so lucky to have known him on a truly amazing adventure."

Chris' family have appealed to anyone with information to contact them.

Det Supt Sarah Lacey of the Met Police said: "We are treating this as a tragic loss. Our thoughts are with his family and friends."

The deaths are currently being treated as unexplained.

Police are appealing for anyone in the area to come forward if they saw Mr Hardman at 4.30pm in London on Tuesday or anyone who witnessed his body at the scene on Wednesday.

A post-mortem examination has been carried out.

They have released images of a number of items which they believe may be connected to the case.

Det Supt Lacey thanked anyone who had provided information, adding: "We are in the early stages of assessing the information and are investigating these cases and I am unable to comment further as this is a police matter."

Anyone with information is asked to contact the incident room on 020 8543 4427.
