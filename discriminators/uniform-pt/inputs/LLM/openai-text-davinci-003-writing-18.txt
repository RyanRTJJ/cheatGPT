It had been a normal day in our home universe until, suddenly, disaster struck. From out of thin air a massive portal appeared, seemingly at random, and out came another version of our world. Visible to the naked eye, this second Earth was almost identical to ours but displayed the tell-tale signs of the differences in development, the varying landscapes, architectures, and the most shocking difference, the colors of its sky.

For days, scientists from around the world had been trying to make sense of this second Earth and its appearance in front of them, but all of their investigations and theories seemed to have gone unheeded. Then, one brilliant scientist figured out the mystery. He realized that due to recent quantum fluxes and an unprecedented amount of energy released by a newly invented technology, an alternate reality bending event had occurred.

This alternate Earth had become so closely linked to our own that it had been drawn into the same space-time but in a completely different dimension. Now, scientists of both universes scrambled to understand the implications of this marvel of nature.

Communication between the two universes was quickly established, allowing for further discoveries. Both civilizations had astounding similarities and differences, from the languages built around them to their particular forms of government. Technology, art, and culture had reached far different places on each world, making the discovery of one another even more interesting.

In this manner, the two civilizations quickly realized the benefit of each otherâ€™s contributions to the world at large. Scientists of each world shared valuable insights and discoveries, as did writers and artists. Entire books and films of one world were studied and replicated on the other, giving fire to civilizations that had been slowly dying out.

Over time, the quantum fluxes
