 by the club's founder, the late Peter Scholz, "with your acceptance and endorsement". The club was re-inaugurated in 1933, again with the support and sponsorship of Mr Scholz. However, the year ended with a relegation to the Lancashire Association Division Three. In 1936, the Football Association were granted the power to "take appropriate action" against the club if they refused to take their place in the league.

The club were also able to use the ground for a number of matches throughout the 1950s, including an FA Cup final against Manchester City at Wembley, the first match at which a European club, England, made use of the facility.
