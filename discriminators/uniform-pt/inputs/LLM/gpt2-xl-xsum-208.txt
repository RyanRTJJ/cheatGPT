 the video recording technology on the OS. Although Microsoft says the updates have "no impact" on users, it warns that users should always back up their personal videos to cloud storage as soon as they stop using a camera. Microsoft notes that the company "takes privacy and security extremely seriously and we don't store any photos or video of the camera we add."

Since the video recording feature was introduced on Windows 10, a number of camera manufacturers have produced cheap and easy-to-use models that have come to the market. Samsung's Bixby button on the Galaxy S9 Plus can function as a remote control to control your phone's smart assistant, Bixby. You can use Samsung's Bixby button as a remote control to get the phone's flashlight to flash, launch music to play, and more.

It's unclear what Microsoft is doing with the Skype and videos, but it's likely that the company uses them for research. At a conference earlier this month, Microsoft researcher Adam Bienkov explained that he had been using a third-party webcam and recording footage but couldn't upload the footage. He explained this by saying that Microsoft has implemented a software method allowing a person to see what the cameras are seeing and the microphone and look away so that only the person recording the video can see the person being recorded. This is likely a form of facial recognition and is similar to what one gets with Google's Ingress.

Microsoft also recently sent the first wave of Surface devices out to developers, and a few devices seem likely to be the ones to use Microsoft's facial expression recognition software. But while Microsoft is certainly experimenting with technology around its cameras, as was discussed at a Microsoft event back in September, the company doesn't seem to be trying to integrate it into its products. Microsoft is one of the few companies that offers full video capture capabilities on the phone, but it's unlikely they'll use that capability to get facial recognition capabilities into its products.
