_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 5.1.01: Determination "You get on an elevator and the doors close behind you. But a second later, the elevator stops and your friend steps on it. You look down, and at the bottom of the shaft is a huge hole...." _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ "Two strangers meet in a bar. Both are young men, both have one thing in common: they don't like strangers." (Written with the assumption that it is a normal bar, but still the premise isn't clear enough to set aside)Â  "One is an arrogant rich kid, the other is an arrogant kid with a bad attitude. Both of them have a bottle of beer in front of them but don't seem to be drinking it. Both of them know that they're friends from school, but neither of them can quite place where they're at. One says, 'Do you think we're friends?' The other retorts, 'No, we think you're idiots.' The first says, 'No, we think you're dead.' The other says, 'Shut the fuck up, you're a loser.' " What if you get sucked into the first guy? Why is he so mad? What should you do if he's your friend? _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 5.1.02: An Eye for Details "You're a good driver. But don't you dare drive faster than me! I own my own car. You may just get arrested. You may just find yourself getting hit out of nowhere, out of nowhere." (A friend asks you to go out with him. You say no, then he tells you that you'll feel just fine once you get there.) "You're a good person, you're a good lover... and you make good friends... I bet everything changes once you get together." (A friend asks you to get a picture of her in your phone, and if she doesn't have one, she sends you one. You accept and you get a picture of a shirtless man, a woman with long, flowing hair, and an arm hanging down to his side.) Your friend isn't your friend anymore ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
