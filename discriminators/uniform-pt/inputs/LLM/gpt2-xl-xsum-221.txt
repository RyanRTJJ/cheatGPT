allana and Marko Arnautovic were all off target for the hosts, while Simon Mignolet made plenty of good saves to deny the visitors a point.

Athletic Bilbao

After a shaky opening half, Athletic made an emphatic return to the starting XI for the first time all season with the return of Jose Antonio Reyes after three months out with a hamstring injury.

The Spain international's introduction almost entirely changed the game from there, with the midfielder and his side, who finished six points clear of their LaLiga rivals, completely dominating proceedings from start to finish.

The Spaniard had a hand in four of Bilbao's eight goals, scoring twice and keeping a clean sheet, whilst Kevin Gameiro, Kepa Arrizabalaga and Jose Manuel Jurado all also found the net for the hosts.

Reyes was in goal from the kick-off for the first time this season.

Diego Simeone's side will face a very stiff test against Barcelona later this month.

Barcelona made their first start in nine games at this tournament as Gerard Pique and Ivan Rakitic were among the substitutes.

The players will face a big test against Sevilla on Tuesday, but the first half was a nightmare for the home side and a poor passing game led to numerous missed chances against a Barca side intent on preserving their lead.

The visitors had a number of efforts going in during the first half, with Messi heading over from Messi's assist for Rakitic, before the forward turned provider once more.

Barca's midfield three of the attacking trio of Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Luis Suarez were all off target, which was down to a poor performance in attack.

Luis Enrique's side began the second half as they had the first, but had a late chance to equalise - Rakitic had the goal from a corner, but Messi was off target.

Atletico Madrid

Diego Simeone's side overcame Real Sociedad by two clear goals in the late stages to reach the semi-finals of the competition.
