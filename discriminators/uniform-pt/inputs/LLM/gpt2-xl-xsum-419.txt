 Royal Ontario Museum. They got it in 1981 and it was taken to London to be on display by the Museum of Science and Industry.

It is covered in a black coating and is engraved with images and text describing it. There is a quote from the NASA website saying "the Apollo 11 moon rock represents the first humans to step foot on the surface of another world." It is on display at the National Museum of Wales, where it is currently on display until 2016.

The rock was purchased by the museum, from a private collector, in 2003, based on the quote about the rocks in the NASA website. They had it for years on display and now only a few people have seen it, so it is going to be moved to another museum after it's loan ends.

I first saw them in 1999 in the Royal Ontario Museum, when I was visiting from Canada. I was blown away. They were incredibly well preserved and beautiful. I was surprised there was only one surviving one!

The Museum of Science and Industry, based in Toronto, purchased it for Â£900,000 (around $1600,000 USD) in 2001 from a private collector.

Here are a bit of background and information about the rock and its significance. (click on any of the pictures to enlarge them).

This is a very special meteoritical rock. It had been acquired by England in 1903, when Edward VII presented a gold-plated space rock made from platinum, to the Queen. In the Queen Queen Victoria presented two other meteoritic space rocks in 1907 (iron rocks and a small moon rock which were originally from the American government) to the Queen. They were presented to King George V on April 15, 1908.

The meteoritic minerals and rocks from the Moon (named Ganymede after the mythic Titan moon) will be displayed together in honour of the 100th anniversary of Rosetta's landing on the Martian surface in 2004.
