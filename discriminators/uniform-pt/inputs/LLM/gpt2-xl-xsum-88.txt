C continues to produce programmes for Welsh viewers before the BBC starts to broadcast in the autumn.


It asked the broadcasters, who have made only modest progress, to report to the committee by 5 February "on the progress they have made in implementing the recommendations of the inquiry into funding for BBC 3 on Welsh channel S4C... together with options to fund those improvements which have not already been invested to date".

Welsh MPs have repeatedly called for the budget for S4C to rise to £30m a year, which the BBC is in dispute with the Government over its contribution.

An attempt by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee to increase S4C funding from its current £1m to £30m failed in December. The Culture, Media and Sport Committee did, however, adopt its recommendations for raising the budget to £30m.

However, S4C has made progress, with a report in February showing its "transmission of BBC 3 programmes has more than doubled in 2017 compared to the year prior".

The report also said that three new dramas have also been added to S4C's output, including a two-part adaptation of the bestselling comic book series Black Mirror and the thriller Ghost Brigades. S4C programmes include the popular show The Last Leg, which was recently shown on BBC One.

A recent report by the Office for Budget Responsibility suggested that the corporation's budget for supporting Welsh programmes is the "least transparent budget in the UK parliament".

However, it said the Welsh Government was committed to "funding the broadcaster for its strategic mandate, including the allocation of £2m a year for the next parliament to ensure the future of S4C".

The report recommended that the government's commitment was "rewarded as and when agreed".

Welsh Affairs spokesman Roger Scully said: "We welcome this endorsement of the continued strategic mandate of S4C. We welcome its commitment to funding the broadcaster for its strategic mandate on the basis of meritocracy, independence and sound funding arrangements."
