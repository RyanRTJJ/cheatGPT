 first, the teenager told the court that she had hit the dog, causing it to jump into the road, but later confessed that her "self-prescribed alcohol dose" had been much greater.

Judge Stephen Hill, QC, sentenced the girl, who cannot be named, to two years in prison. He said: "The impact on the other two of you when you had a drink containing alcohol in it would in the ordinary course of things have been severe and that would have been compounded when they started going to school."

Other teenagers who had been with the girl during the incident were taken into specialist support services at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Three were admitted to hospital because of breathing difficulties. Three girls were treated at the scene by emergency services and taken by ambulance to the nearby Princess Royal Hospital, where they were treated for minor injuries. A 16-year-old boy was also treated for breathing difficulties at the scene, but was not admitted to hospital because his injuries were not thought to be as serious as the others, and he was also treated at the hospital when it was not known whether he had sustained serious injuries. He could not be interviewed by police until the morning of the sentence.

The case came as a teenager received a nine-month suspended prison sentence yesterday for driving under the influence of alcohol at a traffic cameras between 2pm and 5pm, on 18 February. James Francis, of the West Midlands, admitted alcohol-related driving on the junction of the A5521 and A5524 in Wolverhampton. In sentencing, judge Gary Griffiths said: "It is a very serious offence. There are very high levels of alcohol in your body. Your victim was knocked off her mobility scooter in a way which obviously could have been dangerous so your own victim could suffer too."

The court heard Francis told police he had taken a drink and a line of cocaine at a property on Greenhaven Road, Rochdale,
