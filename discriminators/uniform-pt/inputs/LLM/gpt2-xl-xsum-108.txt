 expect the mask to be put into place with the second of two of the huge Webb observatory's primary mirrors in August 2014. The telescope, which is scheduled to launch in October 2018, will provide the first look at the infant Universe, when stars and galaxies have less than a billion years' worth of stars and gas.

The mirror is now on place, which should help with its accuracy. Webb will have one main mirror that will be 17.44 meters (56 feet) in diameter, and four secondary mirrors, the smallest sizes that a telescope is designed to use. The second mirror, which is not yet assembled, will be 27.25 meters (84 feet) in diameter and has been put around a support structure to provide more sunlight to the telescope's detectors. When they're ready, the first mirror and the second mirror will be aligned and connected.

"The Webb Telescope will have a unique ability to take in light from distant objects," said Bill Borucki, Webb telescope program manager at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. "The instrument will be able to see some of the very oldest stars ever seen in the Universe, the birthplaces of the most common types of stars. This will be a wonderful opportunity to learn about the composition of early galaxies with the power of the world's largest observatory. We've got the telescope, we've got the equipment, now it's time to figure out how we're going to make this observatory work."

The first step will be to position the observatory with the new mirror placed inside the first primary mirror. The second primary mirror is now in position, and will be rotated to center onto the main mirror in the upcoming months â€“ likely at the end of July or early August. The new mirror will then be put around the support beam at the other end of the telescope, which is the part of the telescope that gathers light from the Sun. A number of
