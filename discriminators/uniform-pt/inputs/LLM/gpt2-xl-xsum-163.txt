, as they saw that there are powerful vested interests at play.

I asked a UKIP voter whether voting for a party that didn't represent their views was more damaging.

"'If you voted Ukip because of Nigel Farage,' she said, "'you would never agree with UKIP or the Conservative Party because there would be no way that Nigel would get things through the House of Commons." Instead, she explained, UKIP had found "this weird and wonderful new relationship with the Conservative Party."

The EU referendum turned out to be one of the worst policy disasters in British politics for decades. Brexit wasn't a choice between two sides – it was a choice between two sides that shared a common enemy.

A vote for leave was a vote for a British exit from Europe. The fact that many in the media have tried, desperately, to make the EU referendum seem like an act of civil disobedience – in opposition to a government that they thought was tyrannical and corrupt – should make us all deeply wary of the people making these demands.

We have had enough of the EU as it exists now and would be far better off without. We won't actually vote for that exit anyway unless it's for the European Council (the EU executive body), to bring us closer to the common eurozone and the EU's customs union.

What many people voted for was not to leave, but to stop the continuation of the EU that existed before we voted in May.
