 of the moment the rocket blasted off.

"The first manned flight by our next generation of human explorers blasts off on schedule from US soil," the space agency said.

The New Shepard rocket will carry a capsule named 'Far East' on the maiden test flight from Florida, after more than two years of build-up.

After landing safely, the capsule will be taken out of the ocean for recovery.

The rocket was blasted into space from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility outside of Virginia.

The mission will kick off the latest phase in the development of US space technologies, which includes NASA's Mars mission.

"I wouldn't mind doing another one," Mr Trump said as he surveyed the results of test fire of a rocket engine at the White House: "It was a beautiful ceremony, it was good fun."

Nasa said it would "provide regular updates" about the test fire in a week, including the capsule's deployment and landing on the launch pad and its impact on the ocean.

After the test fire, Mr Trump praised the space agency's scientists for their "amazing courage, resourcefulness and commitment" in "moulding the future of space exploration".

The New Shepard was developed to carry people to about 400 km (248 miles) and around a tenth of the speed of sound, making it possible to fly to places the US is unable to reach because of geographies like thick jungle.

It will be launched in 2018 on a test flight to the International Space Station (ISS).

Space Exploration Technologies Corp, the private company whose mission was chosen for the final crew launch, announced it would take two more steps before carrying passengers into orbit - first of all testing the new capsule's rocket engine.

It will undergo tests of the engines for its first launch in the second half of 2016, then with the second in the next two months.
