 whether they felt these were necessary for living a full life. The team, which was composed of psychiatrists from the University of Vienna, found happiness increases as one's level of enjoyment increases – whether from enjoying activities, learning new skills, having fun or simply getting on with one's life.

"The most important finding was that higher enjoyment was associated with happier life outcomes," the scientists write.

It is believed that a happier brain reduces the effects of stress as well as increases levels of the hormones serotonin and oxytocin, which play important roles in social behaviour, reproductive success, emotion regulation and immune function.

Lead researcher Dr Andrea Ghez, psychiatry professor at the University of Vienna, told The Huffington Post UK that the team discovered higher satisfaction in people who achieve their goals.

"We found the effect of having goals is very significant in terms of happiness. This is important because the more often you achieve something – whether it's a goal or a new project – the happier you become," she said.

She said the team's results were consistent with previous studies that revealed the quality of people can alter how happy they are, and this effect is particularly strong when people have a high sense of accomplishment.

"Some people may have seen them as 'big' goals, whereas for me they have become something simple, but important and beneficial. They are the ones that give you meaning in life - so there is a real change in your happiness in the long run," she added.

Prof Ghez suggested that happiness is important for people to live a balanced life, but stressed not too much can ruin an otherwise "happy" life.

"It's important to be able to take care of yourself but not over-consume," she said.

"You shouldn't go out and eat your way to happiness all the time. You just won't get there. Too much indulging could be a mistake."
