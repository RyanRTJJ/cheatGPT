 believe that the death penalty is "often or sometimes justifiable," compared to 53% seven years ago and 73% in 1994. However, a 2014 NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist national poll found that a majority of Americans believe that the death penalty should be used more often.

The American public's public-opinion polling hasn't taken a negative turn on the death penalty. A 2013 Pew Research Center poll found 52% of Americans believe it should be available to people who have committed crimes that people in their community see as very serious.

"The death penalty is a tough issue for many Americans, and one in which Americans vary widely in their political leanings," the Center for Public Integrity noted in September 2014.

The death penalty has a long and complicated history in the U.S.

The earliest executions in the U.S. were carried out by hanging â€” and by death for capital murder, at least, until the law was changed in the 1880s.

In the late 1700s, death penalty opponents and abolitionists lobbied for the abolition of the death penalty, especially before the 1882 Exclusion Act kept slaves from escaping to free ports from the North. The case of Herman Webster Mudgett, tried as "unjustly convicted" of murdering his wife, became another landmark case when two prominent abolitionists, Edward Bennett Williams and William Lloyd Garrison, helped win Mudgett's release after he spent 21 years in prison.

But the practice had been around long before those abolitionists, even before the American Revolution, during which three ex-cons were hanged.

Some scholars also say one of the reasons some people oppose the death penalty is the fear of being accused of being "soft on crime." A Gallup national poll released earlier this year found that 56% of U.S. adults worry that the death penalty "would be too severe" when applying it to someone accused of a crime and that 61% of people disapprove of using it to punish someone "who is only guilty of being caught with drugs, which is a misdemeanor in most states."

But those fears also
