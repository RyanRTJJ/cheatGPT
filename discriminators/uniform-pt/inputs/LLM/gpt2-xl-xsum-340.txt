inness, as he could "insinuate too much in public."

But Mr Donaldson rejected criticism of his stance, stating the "most important" thing would have to be done was ask Mr McGuinness about the killing.

The former first minister's claim came as the British government agreed to allow a UN panel led by lawyer Richard Goldstone to probe alleged human rights violations by both Britain and Israel in the occupied territories.

Mr Goldstone has already called on the government to admit that a recent massacre was unlawful and warned of "grave concerns" over the "serious and pervasive criminal conduct by the Israeli authorities."

The NIO has previously said the killings at the Begin House complex in Belfast would have to be regarded as war crimes if Mr McGuinness's remarks were not to be accepted.

In a statement, Mr Donaldson, who spent 10 years in the Northern Ireland Office and was a senior adviser to former prime minister Tony Blair, said: "The most important thing is that the secretary of state should recognise the role of Sinn FÃ©in in that conflict."

The DUP leader's view was not shared by the NIO.

Responding to Mr Donaldson's comments, a spokeswoman for its secretary Martin McGuinness said: "It is an offence to investigate a person without going before an investigation. It's clear that what John Donaldson has said is totally contrary to that fundamental principle."

The committee will also hear from Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire about the future of the controversial security partnership between the state and the DUP. He will discuss how the state can preserve the partnership while ensuring continued support from the DUP.
