 over the information," Blatter was reported as saying.

He did not detail what that information was, or how many "corrupt and misbehaving" people have been arrested, but added that the "corrupt and misbehaving list is growing daily" and would be published "soon".

The arrests were the latest in a long-running investigation into corruption allegations regarding Fifa, but this time there is no suggestion of any criminal act.

Blatter had announced the appointment of former attorney general Michael Garcia as investigator last August in what was seen as a bid to clean up the scandal, which has seen four senior Fifa figures indicted and a number of others suspended.

But his decision to take his investigation into Fifa outside Switzerland, first announced last month, comes in the wake of Garcia's sudden resignation after less than two weeks on the job.

A Fifa official said Garcia would "step down as investigation co-ordinator in the coming days".

Some within Fifa are suspicious this move might be an attempt to force off Garcia, with one source suggesting "it is a last-ditch effort to buy all the time".

It is also possible that Garcia is being forced out to avoid giving anything up.

Fifa has a history of using independent investigators to find out who might have broken its rules.

But it seems Garcia was not the man to succeed Sheikh Salman, the longtime ruler of the North African country. In fact, they say Garcia had previously worked for the Gulf state and was working independently.

Fifa will be deeply embarrassed by the revelation that its investigations team are not independent investigators - they are often employed by member confederations to help them with their own investigations.

The allegations against Fifa began to emerge last year when Swiss prosecutors indicted 14 Fifa officials, including a former Fifa vice-president, on corruption charges.

The charges related to a $10m (Â£6.3m) payment made in 2010 by South Africa Football Association (Safa) to Jack Warner's Concacaf confederations to host the 2010 World
