 had received a number of phone calls from Labour MPs after his comments in his Brighton constituency.

Mr Field said he was frustrated by comments made by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson of his support for Mr Corbyn, and claimed it is now a "closed shop" in the party.

Some MPs called in to Mr Field's radio show this morning, including Chris Bryant and Lucy Powell, had heard him saying Labour MPs want to fight the future of the country against Tory plans.

He said Labour MPs had a duty to "stand up" to anti-social behaviour, but did not see any mention of bullying in his speech.

He told listeners: "I spoke about anti-social behaviour recently and I'm trying to fight it.

"I was talking to somebody who's a Labour councilor and I said to him 'well Chris, I've got a duty at my time as a councillor to stand up to anti-social behaviour; I do have to stand up to abusive behaviour, but the government have to step in with plans in order to deal with all sorts of anti-social behaviour. I'm not fighting bullying, I'm standing up to abusive behaviour".
