"The association with obesity and the abnormal sleep times remained apparent even for the people who were healthy, which was surprising," said principal investigator Dr Sarah Tishkoff, Senior Lecturer in Epidemiology at the University of Stirling's School of Medicine in Scotland.

"There's no clear explanation for the underlying molecular mechanism. Our next step is to investigate why and the possibility of using pharmaceutical intervention to tackle this issue at an early stage."

The analysis of the genetic variants associated with sleep abnormalities also highlighted the importance of environmental factors which contribute to these variations in sleep patterns. This was particularly highlighted for genes contributing to the genetic architecture of obesity, in particular, the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) binding protein 4 (Kf4) gene.

Researchers determined that both children and adults who were overweight or obese also had lower levels of levels of the hormone prolactin in their blood. Prolactin stimulates the growth hormone into action. The findings also shed light on why children's sleep patterns are at a greater risk for obesity. This study also found that children without a genetic predisposition to obesity, were at a greater risk for abnormal sleep patterns even when they were healthy.
