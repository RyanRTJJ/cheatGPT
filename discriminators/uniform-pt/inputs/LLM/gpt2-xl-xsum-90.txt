 a software update, he said. "It's not like we cut the engine in half, and the car looks a bit worse. It is a tiny little thing, but it needs to be addressed for those that have vehicles with 1.6L engines," he said.

Daimler said the action was "a one-time, temporary measure that will have no long-term effect on our customers' fuel efficiency".

An update to the 1.6L engine software will be offered free of charge, and for existing customers the software upgrade is priced at 9,000 Euro ($12,700) per model year.

In 2014, Daimler sold 1.7 million 3.0-litre diesel power plants, including 1.6-litre engines.

In February, Mercedes-Benz sold a record 1.1 million units of a 1.4-litre diesel engine fitted to its A-Class.

On Saturday, Mercedes released another detailed report regarding fuel economy and emissions in the 3.0-litre diesel A-Class diesel, saying its fuel consumption increased by 3.7% in real world driving compared with the prior model.

"The new model is more emission-friendly and therefore, more sustainable," said Daimler chief Dieter Zetsche at the Frankfurt Motor Show earlier this year.

He added that the automaker had received over 400,000 orders for the new diesel A-Class. "The diesel engine on the A-Class is in a very advanced stage," Zetsche said. "We cannot offer exact figures right now. We have reached the limit of our knowledge for real emissions."

The company said it wants a full year of test drives and customer usage before determining whether to modify the A-Class engine to meet the Euro 5 norms for Euro 5.

The 2.0-litre TDI diesel A-Class will be offered in two variants -- A-Class Coupe (with manual gearbox), and A-Class Sedan (with automatic).
