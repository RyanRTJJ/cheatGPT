_____________________________________ My response: 1. You never gave me any idea what a "secret society" was that wanted you dead. I can tell you that the government is more interested in investigating the disappearance of extraterrestrials than what happened at the hospital. 2. The fact that it's not your daughter calling just blows your mind. 3. The woman will die a horrible death. At least she didn't die in the hospital, though, where the government would have made sure a bad death was "probable". _____________________________________ My response: 1. Your daughter probably didn't want to be a part of the secret society, but at least it wasn't the women's league. She may have been kidnapped, as you suggested to her. In the same way, her abduction may have been part of their plot to destroy the alien society, and may even have involved a "false flag," possibly a meteor. Again, the government would have had a hand in her abduction. 2. "Solving" a disappearance like that by sending in the police doesn't sound like any of your "business" to me. The police force doesn't make anyone disappear. I'll bet you had better plans for her. _____________________________________ My response: 1. Why didn't you give me any information about the alien society? If you think I'm trying to get you to say the government has abducted her (what kind of an insane person puts a good word in for the president?), I'm not. I just want an answer to one of my questions. I want to know which people from her life, if any, knew that nothing could be done. I want to know if any people ever saw her or spoke to her in any way. I want every detail of her life. I don't want nothing else. I'll be writing your response after I've heard your response. And I'm going to get right to it.
