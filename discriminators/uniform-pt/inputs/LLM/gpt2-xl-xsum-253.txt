 decision to grant planning permission to the firm, citing safety concerns about hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.

In December Judge Paul Bollen ruled in favour of North Yorkshire. He cited "significant public and economic benefits" to be had from fracking in Ryedale. Bollen declared North Yorkshire "categorically incapable of performing its statutory functions."

Friends of the Earth's director, John Sauven, said:

"The shale gas licence under review by the North Yorkshire County Council is a clear and unwelcome step in an unbroken stream of failures on the part of the council to protect the public from dangerous fracking schemes.

"This is just another example of the council's unwillingness to properly scrutinise fracking companies when they come before them for planning permission, failing to apply proper scrutiny and allowing planning permission to be given in the first instance knowing that there may be unacceptable dangers present. Our opposition to fracking is not about protecting local water supplies but about protecting the environment and the health and well-being of people living nearby."

The Environment Agency has ruled on applications for fracking and fracking licences in Cheshire and Lancashire (see here for details of Cheshire case) and Cheshire county council has already passed a controversial fracking proposal through its planning committee, despite protests from environmental groups.

A spokesman for the Cheshire County Council declined to comment.

The NCC said the council had commissioned an independent review of fracking risks to ensure that the impact on the wider community had been considered.

The report, conducted by the environmental law firm Sullivans Solicitors, found that shale gas extraction "will not present major issues for the environment, nor do they present a significant risk to local biodiversity. This report also stated the risks are acceptable and not significantly higher than those associated with most fossil fuels extraction processes."

The council has been criticised by local activists for trying to block community opposition to the plan, which was expected to be approved during its next scheduled meeting.

Speaking last week to The Ecologist, Chris Rogers, of anti-fracking group North Yorkshire Frack Off, said: "This case is a very poor way of getting councillors and government to understand how damaging fracking will be for communities."
