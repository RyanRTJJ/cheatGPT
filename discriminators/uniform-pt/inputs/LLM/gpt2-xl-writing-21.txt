 if you're feeling particularly bold!  I'm open to seeing all characters.  You'll have to ask everyone first.  This is for personal stories only, no fanfic, etc. No adult content is allowed here, but please don't be offended if you read some.  No sexual content is allowed (for example, no lesbian sex), so don't bother leaving a review if you're looking for that (or, for that matter, if you're looking for fanfic, fanart, or other non-fiction material). I'm currently accepting submissions of one or two chapters a week.
 This site contains erotic fiction based on the works of my comic book, X-Powers.
This site contains fan art based on my comic book, X-Powers, and other adult fan materials.  I accept submissions of fan art as long as it is safe for work (for example, no nudity), and safe for children (no adult material).  You have some great options for submitting, including (but not limited to) tumblr, facebook, twitter,  deviant art, deviant art.com, deviantart.net, reddit, and tumblr.  Please give credit where credit is due: Thank you to every person who has submitted art to the site or created fanart. I'm super glad that there are people out there who enjoy creating these amazing things.
This blog has the first 2 volumes of X-Powers:  Rated R   (Volume 1) and  Rated X   (Volume 2).
This blog contains erotic erotica.  You can also submit any non-erotic pieces, but please be aware that some works are NSFW.  I will ask for authors to write as realistically as possible and to not portray characters (whether the person is male or female) in sexual situations that are not real, including the act of sexual intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, sexual oral sex, and anal penetration. I reserve the right to block content that is considered to represent inappropriate material or violate copyright (such as fan art or fan works
