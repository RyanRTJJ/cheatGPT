s team and became the fourth UK crew to win this individual men's race. The next event will probably be the 500m individual medley with Greves and Wilson in pole position. The event which may be more exciting than the individual event is the women's 400m individual medley. GB have a great chance of finishing second.

The final two events are the individual 400m and 800m T44 for the USA and Great Britain. Both the Americans and the Britons have looked fast at the start in London but their times have dropped as the race has progressed. This race will be the most decisive event in London as both the leading nations will be determined.

The last event is the individual 400m T44 from America. This race will be won or lost as it has often been in recent years. Britain have some fantastic athletes in this race and Katie Greves, Jessica Eddie, Melanie Wilson, Lucy Bronze and Lucy Griffiths will be looking to fight off the US for that victory.

The final podium consists of the USA's Sally Pearson, Nicole Mannion, Sarah Sjostrom, Jessica Winkleman, Lauren LeSouviourge and Jessica Jardine.
