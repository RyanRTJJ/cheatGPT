frustrating and scary" and said that as many as 40 pupils may not make it all week.

Pupils in Wylam, Abertillery, Cardiff, Penarth and Gwynedd are to attend assemblies held on Monday and Tuesday and will have a week off for Christmas.

"There will be two assemblies today and no recess on Monday and Tuesday," said Carmarthenshire council's head teacher, Mark Wood. "We have one school for each grade in Carmarthen. We have been told there are schools around the country that can't use the schools they had in place for the Christmas holidays because of school closures."

Pupils' absence is affecting the daily running of local schools, who said that any disruption will affect the quality of instruction for pupils. "We are having to bring in extra staff to assist with the workload to try to help with the load and make sure we deliver the day for the pupils and their families," said Steve Williams, head of schools.

On Monday 10 schools in Carmarthenshire - including Harlech, Abertillery, Wylam and Nant Llywelyn - had to cancel assemblies after pupils failed to turn up for a normal afternoon.

While all state-funded schools in Wales will have an extra week - the same as those in England - all local authority schools still have to provide for all pupils in their own way. A spokesman for the Welsh Education Secretary said the Welsh government "fully respects" pupils' right to education. "Our priority is making sure that any impact caused by this summer's recess closures is minimised," said the spokesman.

The Welsh government has set aside Â£80m for the 2016-17 academic year to help schools address the impact of recess closures and school holidays on pupils in deprived areas. It said these provisions will be funded by a new levy on fuel, which will be charged to owners of new-build properties.

However there are fears that some local authority schools may not be able to absorb the extra expense.

Welsh ministers will meet parents at Easter to reassure them about the government's commitment to school closures and lessons for those who have lost their holiday.
