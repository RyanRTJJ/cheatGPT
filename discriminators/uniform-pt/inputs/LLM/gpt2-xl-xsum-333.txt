GP Referrals

If you are a registered GP in Wales (Welsh Local Health Board or Welsh Primary Care Trust) you should be able to receive referrals from the public health, accident and emergency (AE&E), public health and external medicine (EH&M), public health and social work doctors.

It should be noted that those seeking GP care at a private GP practice cannot receive referral referrals from those who are registered to practice in the NHS.

The national referral system, called PHEAC, will work in conjunction with NHS Wales and the local councils to match you up with a GP who meets the requirements under the Primary Care Working Group to be able to refer you to an NHS care team.

The PHEs and Primary Care Working Group are working to create a consistent set of GP standard terms and a code of practice to help to ensure effective referral processes.

It is also expected that more GP work will be done by specialists to enhance practice management, so that work is carried out by more GP practices with the same people.

You may also visit an Emergency Department to discuss your concerns, or request to have a non-urgent case assessed.

If you have concerns over a specific event or procedure, you should discuss how best to access them.

An urgent case is very serious that demands immediate treatment until it can be dealt with and a doctor can be called. An Emergency Department will give you the right to have it assessed and assessed only in the most serious case.
