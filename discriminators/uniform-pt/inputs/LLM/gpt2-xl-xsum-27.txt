Neath Port Talbot Health Board said in May it had found a "significant pattern" of failings by other agencies in the care of patients at the hospital, including the CQC, the Home Office and the Health Board.

Created in 2000 to oversee the care and treatment of patients with dementia

It also conducts investigations into those who fail to meet the standards of good care
