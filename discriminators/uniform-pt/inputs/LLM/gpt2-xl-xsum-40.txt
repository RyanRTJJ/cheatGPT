 while police have tried to keep more of an eye on historic houses, others say a long-standing reluctance within the criminal justice system to target the crimes that so many revere means it's been difficult to break the cycle.

"We would love it to happen as often as possible in the future but we just don't have the tools right now," says Detective Chief Inspector John White in the West Yorkshire force, whose officers focus on fighting crimes against the environment.

In 2011, his officers made more than 20 arrests for crimes against historic buildings – including thefts of antiques, drugs and firearms. All but one case eventually went to court, but the average jail time was just two to three years.

"We have to understand that people's sense of values and morality might change, but the majority of people will never really do anything like that," White says.

That hasn't stopped historic properties being targeted, although. Earlier this year, a house was burnt down in Sheffield by a local thug – only days after a couple were fined and banned from buying any homes in York after committing multiple offences including vandalism to a 15th century church. In the same town recently, a man threw acid in the face of the owner of a home owned by a great-great grandfather who had bought it from him.

"Those are very extreme circumstances, and some of those people will go to prison, so they do deserve to go to prison," White says. "But there are still too many people who take these acts as a cheap thrill and it's getting harder to tackle it. The law and society's attitudes need to change."

Detective Chief Inspector Robert Mabbutt, who leads the Met's heritage crime unit, says police are determined to tackle the trend.

"If it becomes a problem then we'll step up and say we'll find it."

Mabbutt says the best defence
