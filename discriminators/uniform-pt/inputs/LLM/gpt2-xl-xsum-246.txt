 saying: "We have made it very clear that Huawei will not have any role in the telecommunications sector in China." He added that the company is not a member of any government group. "Huawei does not have any relation with Chinese or the Chinese military. On the contrary, our technology for communications is a direct product of the technology developed by the US government." Huawei has also been embroiled in controversy over the alleged sale of the technology to Beijing. US companies are not allowed to sell equipment to China without permission in the world's largest economy.

Mr Ren suggested that other Chinese phone makers may soon follow suit and that Huawei had a future in the US. Huawei has been the target of much regulatory scrutiny in China, with an aggressive lobbying campaign in Washington and an attempt to secure US government business in Silicon Valley. It has been accused of being used for national security, but executives have denied those claims. In a statement, Huawei said that the US government had already approved sales to China. "The fact that a US department of justice signed a final rule for these operations on June 18, 2011, is a strong confirmation that it is the government of the United States that authorises our operations in all matters," it said. Huawei's US chairman, Ren Zhengfei, did not cite concerns about national security in his comments to Mr Pfeiffer but admitted that "the relationship between the two countries is currently very tense", referring to disputes with China in technology including control of the internet.

He praised Huawei's work in the US. According to Huawei, its products are used in more than 100 million devices sold in America. About one in 10 of those phones are powered by the Huawei chipset, Mr Ren said. The US sales will be "exclusively for Huawei technologies. We are not going to market Huawei's services to Americans."
