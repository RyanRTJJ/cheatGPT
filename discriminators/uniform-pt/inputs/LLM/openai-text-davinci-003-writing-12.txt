The night I was robbed started out the same as any other night. I headed out to the grocery store to pick up a few things for dinner, completely unaware of the danger that was about to come my way.

As I rounded the corner, I spotted two men lurking in the shadows. Instantly, I knew something was wrong. My heart started to beat faster and my feet froze in place. But before I could turn and run, the men had grabbed me and thrown something over my head â€“ a bag. I screamed and struggled against them, but to no avail.

The men quickly dragged me away from the store and down a dark alley, where I was sure I was about to meet my fate. I was so frightened that I thought I was going to pass out. Then, suddenly, I felt the men rip my bag away. I heard the sound of coins and notes being taken, and I knew I had been robbed.

The men then ran away, leaving me feeling helpless and violated. I stumbled my way back home in tears, scared and shaken. I had never expected to experience such a traumatic event.

That night I was robbed, but I was fortunate enough to walk away with my life. Since then, I take precautions when out and about at night, and am always alert to my surroundings.
