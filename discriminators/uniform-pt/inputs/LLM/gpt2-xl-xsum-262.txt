 album, it was a challenge. The album I released in April, The Outsider has a video that takes us through a month's experience in New York City. There was a week's worth of filming for the video, but I had a challenge; it had been one month since I first laid eyes on Kanye and my choreography for Do What You Want had to match the pace of the album as best as I can." Watch her talk about filming on Thursday's (January 30) episode of Watch What Happens Live below.

This week's episode of Watch What Happens Live is hosted by Harry Connick Jr. and includes appearances from Chris Rock, DJ Khaled, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Diplo, James Corden, and more. Kanye West made a surprise appearance during the show, talking about his new album, Yeezus. Watch the full clip here. Watch What Happens Live airs weeknights (11/10c, NBC) on NBC.

Here's to hoping she'll have the album out by the time her interview with Ellen is airing.
