The campaign sees two words in the iconic shopbarn logo repeated four times in order to encourage a personal response from the customer.

Retailers including Coles, Aldi, Woolworths and Yupp.com collaborated on the campaign, and selected eight customers each from around Australia to take part.

After a series of video interviews with customer service representatives, some participating customers were encouraged to send in their stories.

The online voting was then opened up for wider participation to encourage even more memories and allow the chosen people to receive an online vote from everyone they contacted.

The first 100 voting stories went live at 12.25pm AEST today and have been being cast since then.

Today saw the story of one woman who grew up in a family of soldiers who witnessed a horrific event in her own family.

A young William and his sister came into the Army at the age of three. William's mother, who married a soldier, found herself in hospital with a pregnancy in the second week of the First World War when many young girls went off to hospital and not to be left behind.

He said: "It was really horrible. We watched them shot â€” shot in the head and all that. A really horrible experience to experience that, and I wanted to do something good for other babies."

The story has since reached the top of the online poll with more than 50 people voting for it.

Some of the names from today's stories include Cesar, Mark, William, Tommie and Catherine.

Other voting stories were included include "Who was your friend from army" or "When did it really start to hit you that you hadn't been accepted into the War".

Many people also shared photos of their war experiences and personal stories which have since won accolades from news websites.

"I was lucky in that I got the vote," shared one person posting on social media.

"Seeing the stories of everyone else through your eyes has been incredible."

Aldi also entered the Gallipoli campaign in November
