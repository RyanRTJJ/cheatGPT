Sarah huddled under a mountain blanket in her family's cabin, the white stuff outside continuing to fall. Every so often, the tip of her nose would peak out from the blanket to glance out the window, a deep and excited sigh coming with the sight of each illuminated house-- all in preparation of the upcoming holiday, Christmas.

The holiday had always been special growing up in a big family, with seven siblings and extended family galore. This year, like most, the plan was the same, mass preparations for a big holiday feast followed by a night of fun games and seasonal giveaways. An excited grin found it's way onto Sarah's face at the thought of it, the same one she and her family always wore on this night.

Grandma, the matriarch of the family, had passed away earlier in the year and the hole she left echoed throughout the home.
