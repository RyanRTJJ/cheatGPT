The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme spoke to a number of parents on Thursday as more parents arrive to support their children. The group of parents arriving from all over the country will form the first line of support for the children.

The council say they are aware of the issue in Gloucester and have discussed options with the children's charity Unicef to ensure the children are protected.

"The council's primary aim is to support the children, and to look after them if there is any issue," said Cllr Tom Jones.

"We don't want to put the care workers under any more strain, as they do a fantastic job, but we just want to do the best for the children."

Earlier this week Mr Liversidge said he has spoken to his MPs about their support of the children at St Mary's Church in Gloucester.

"My friends on the backbench have given me positive guidance and the support to ensure our children are in the best possible environment," he said.

"I have a lot of confidence in the NHS and the council's approach."

He said the children were being monitored daily by social workers and they would not be moved unless they were in immediate danger.

Claire Rafferty, a campaigner with Parents4Kids, is one of the parents who have arrived at Gloucester.

"We've been worried since the very beginning because of the lack of support from the council," she said.

"It is not acceptable that the children are still living in the same bedroom as their parents."

He said the children had had "truly horrible" last year.
