 to the village, where the population had dwindled from 13,500 in the 1930s to 2,000 today.

At the same time, a new hydro-electric scheme is being built. This will see the first phase of the Gala Water re-routed from the Doon Waterfalls to an estuary at the town centre, before crossing the Seinco Dam into the river at Galashiels.

Some 6,000 households will benefit, which will cut the reliance on the M9 in terms of power.

It will also be able to accommodate more water by allowing water to be taken from the river at night.

At the end of the year, the village's community development manager Barry O'Brien will be appointed to the development team which is running both the Hydro-Electric and the Estuary Water schemes.

The community have been given until next January to apply to invest in the projects, but if successful they will have a stake in the power station, but will not reap the financial rewards.

Speaking to the BBC, Mr O'Brien said the Gala scheme had the potential of providing more jobs and more tax that had been foregone in having to rely on electricity generated from oil to power the power station.

"That was quite a significant part which our own people weren't able to support and we've got the potential to turn that around and give the back of our community a little bit of economic growth," said Mr O'Brien.

"We are looking to make sure we have the right mix of water, but also renewable energy, to help us get out of a position where we're totally dependent on oil for our power generation."

While planning permission has been granted, the full project - including the new facilities and the power station - is only expected to cost in the region of Â£300m.
