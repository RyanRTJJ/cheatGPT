 the weekend and he hopes to be able to give a similar response when his side play Burnley at home on Saturday.

"We are not going to win every game and I am not thinking about the top four, I am just thinking about the title," Clement said. "Our results have gone in the right direction but we need to go on the attack and I know the players are excited to get back out there and try to win some games.

Swansea's injury absence and a home defeat by Liverpool meant Garry Monk's side could only register a draw at Watford last weekend - a result that could see them drop to ninth position. Their form since that game has been inconsistent to say the least.

"The three games we won, we were 2-0 up and looking the best team in the world but we've had some great results and games where we've been too close," Monk said. "We have to draw games and win games. I thought in the first half we really looked a good side - a team that is on form going into the international break and we've got to keep that up for the remainder of the season."

Swansea's last game without Christian Benteke involved losses against Arsenal and Crystal Palace as the Belgian missed the return defeat at West Ham to rest his groin injury.

The Wales international will miss Saturday's game against the Hornets but he could return for the FA Cup tie with Everton later in the day. Monk has also been quick to reassure fans that the situation is being managed in the right way by the club.

"Christian's not 100 percent as yet, he may be back against Everton but I don't think it'll be long-term for him," he said. "He's going to be really closely monitored over the next couple of weeks with how he's going but he's doing well with this."
