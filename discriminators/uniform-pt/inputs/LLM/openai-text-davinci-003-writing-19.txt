Once upon a time, magic was discovered and it seemed to be everywhere. People felt it, heard it, and saw it, but the most powerful way to harness its power was through music. Almost overnight, the way people viewed music changed, and it soon became a sacred ritual.

In the wake of this newfound magic, many of the modern nations dissolved, leaving behind a map of choppy seas and new countries. These countries were divided by the music they favored and music grew to become their most powerful tool.

In the far northern reaches of the land, the countries of Metal stretched in monochromatic glaciers. This was a hard and loud land where the people submitted to no one.

Although they blended into one another, the regions of Soul in the southern half of the land stood apart in contrast. This was a place of warmth, love and peace where every voice was heard.

On the eastern side, Folk and its quaint towns offered a slower, gentle pace and the music here was always drifting, sinking in and never ending.

In the Starlands far to the west, Pop had become the mainstay of life and the land was immortalized in the stories and music of some of the most famous stars in the world.

Amidst all of this, one thing remained the same - the will to survive and the power of music. For as long as that was preserved, the new countries would continue to flourish.
