___________ 1. I didn't really want a Sims 5 in my life. I don't have another game for my Wii. I don't plan on buying a new game for DS (or 3DS) anytime soon. I already played SimCity, and now that SimCity has been taken down and all copies repacked, I know I'll never buy a new copy of it. 2. I'm really excited for a new Sims. The Sims 3 is really my favorite, but I just want to play something new. But after so, so long of waiting for a new Sims game, I get scared of buying another (somewhat) similar games. I don't want to be caught in the same old trap, yet still play games. 3. This is the type of game I would like to spend my time with. I want to watch people and feel them out. I want to build houses, and have fun. ___________ My Simson had this reaction: "My Sims 5 is dead, so I can't play! What should I do?" "If you're waiting to buy into a franchise, it means you're not mature enough to handle that idea." But...I thought your dad was mature? If you're like me, you will say 'huh, okay.' "Well," you said, "Dad seems to think it's a good idea I buy in to the Sims franchise." ___________ There's only one thing you could have done differently to get your Sims 5. ___________ 1. Turn off cheats. I have every single cheat under the sun, and if you don't believe me, go to my games tab, and see what's there. When I was at my worst, I had to put limits on the number of Sims I could play at once. I also had to limit the amount of time I could play for. It was crazy. I can't wait for the next Sims game. ___________ 2. Go to a new Sims game, and have fun while playing it. I'm looking forward to this one.
