run in a one-day study.

Mr Williams said the force would be doing it in a way that would be much less intrusive than the current system, which requires police to physically attend a scene.

Analysis

The police chief in this south Wales town is proud to be the first force in the UK to introduce body worn body cams.

Officers here have been putting cameras in their police cars for some time.

The footage they have captured is now being processed and tested in a trial run with neighbourhood officers.

It is hoped it will act as a useful tool in the investigation of offences.

The video footage was also expected to help police to identify suspects and help them deal with violence on a "day-to-day" basis.

The move is a landmark for South Wales Police as the force tries to improve the way it serves its communities through technology.

The force will be recruiting more officers to put the body-worn cams on over the next three years.

Insp Ian Tipton said: "We have a strong evidence base from where we've come from. I've seen the officers and heard them speak about how effective these body-worn cameras are.

"The footage that is seen over the top of the footage that we've already got, is going to be invaluable."

A further £10,000 will also go towards training officers on how to use the cameras.

Under the £3m scheme, the bodies of uniformed officers and on-duty civilian staff will be monitored and recorded for 30 days.

South Wales Police has commissioned research to find out how the service's response time and response times could be reduced by using body-worn cameras.

Police are not expected to use the cameras as evidence in crime scenes, nor on criminal suspects while they are in secure settings.

The use of the cameras is likely to be limited to the use of a camera on the dashboard of a police car to record driving.
