 East Anglia and east Lancashire. Its annual budget could be up to £5.5bn by 2022.

The proposals come as Scotland faces a £1bn cut in economic support funding from the government; the Scottish government will have to find an extra £300m a year.

Speaking at Holyrood, Blackford said that to ensure its continued viability and support from Holyrood, HIE will have to grow its membership and revenue.

"We're looking to attract more businesses to the region and to create growth in tourism, the economy and in the wider economy, not just the local economy," he said.

"To do all that we need an investment which supports our workforce and the communities in which they live and work. That's not just a short-term fix, it's not just about money, it's about ensuring we provide a safe and secure environment and a very good quality service."

He argued that the number of small businesses – with a value exceeding £500,000 – in the region has increased sharply.

"I was on a conference call a couple of months ago from a local company called Caledonia who said their average turnover increased from £5,000 to £15,000 in just 30 months with the creation of their first employee," he added.

"So I believe HIE's future success is directly tied to the success of entrepreneurs."

The proposals are backed by the Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCOC), which warned the Scottish economy faces a significant challenge in attracting more firms to the region.

But John MacKay, SCOC chief executive, said: "This is a fantastic opportunity for local government to develop a comprehensive business environment with support for small-scale to small-medium enterprises, while protecting small businesses, creating jobs and creating additional income for both local government and the public purse.

"The SCOC strongly supports the establishment of Scottish Enterprise Regional Offices and I am confident that our industry groups will play their full part in driving Scotland forward in this important change in the way business is done."
