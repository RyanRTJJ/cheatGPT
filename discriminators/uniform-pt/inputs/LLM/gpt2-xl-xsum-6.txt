official guidebook describes the process differently, with a section saying "the dead infant or younger child is generally laid to rest face down on a single mat (the "carpet") on which ashes have been placed; after the mat is set in a proper position, the ashes are wrapped around it and laid to rest next to the child in a resting pose". (page 25) In fact, cremation is the normal procedure as well as the preferred approach, with the exception of infants in the first months of life or in the womb. The council's official guidebook for children aged one to five states that "burial should take place in an area designated for cremation (such as on a gravestone) and remains should be removed by a licensed undertaker (who will usually carry out a pre-arranged pre-burn burial)".(page 543) It added that "burnings shall not take place unless directed by a coroner". The only exception is an infant in the last trimester of pregnancy after normal birth (see Children at Sea). In practice, the law seems to be that most children are cremated. In my view, the Council should follow the wishes of its adult relatives.

This is not unique to the Scottish Council â€“ the Welsh Government has a very similar policy. The Welsh Office describes how the process is usually carried out:

"The coffin is placed together with the coffin contents on a suitable concrete casket. The coffin is then placed on a hearse, or similar form of conveyance, for the purpose of burial and the final step is to place the cemetery register of the birth. The burial in a cemetery is then at the discretion of the family, and the graves are located in the nearest suitable area in a cemetery.

With the exception of cremation where parents/guardians may wish to keep the ashes, the funeral and cremation arrangements would normally be carried out in the same way as they would be for a resident."

The same burial of the deceased should normally be done and the ashes returned to the
