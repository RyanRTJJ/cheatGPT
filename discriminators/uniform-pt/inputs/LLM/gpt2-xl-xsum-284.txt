The CHP's proposal goes further than similar calls by the San Francisco Police Department and the Transportation Agency of China in the West and the West Midlands in the UK, which have also called for drivers to stop turning right into oncoming cyclists when the road is clear. Cycling advocates have long complained that these approaches are too restrictive and could lead to fatal collisions.

"We are calling for a complete solution so that a bicycle rider riding in a road where there is an oncoming automobile should not be at any risk of having an auto pass on the right," CHP officer Mike Moore-Garcia said in a statement Tuesday, the California Highway Patrol's initiative to reduce traffic injuries and fatalities. According to CHP data, the total bicycle-vehicle crash fatality rate in California — the most recent statistics available — is nearly one-third higher than in the rest of the United States.

Driving while left-hand-turning, according to the CHP, is "the main cause" of collisions that injure and kill cyclists, and it is "the leading cause of injuries to bicyclists killed in collisions with cars nationwide."

In 2013, more than a decade after California adopted its first legislation to make it legal for anyone to ride a bike in bike lanes or to use the bike lane to ride, more than 14 percent of all people killed were riding bikes, according to a 2015 state report.

The idea of turning left and passing on the right has also been a top priority for the CHP and the state agency's Traffic Engineering, Operations and Research Department, which studies crashes involving motor vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians.

In 2011, then-California House Speaker John Perez (D) reintroduced a bill to make it illegal for motorists to pass on the left if the road is "clear of oncoming traffic," and to require drivers to remain stopped as long as possible.

The bill failed, but last year the CHP and several bicycle advocacy groups worked with advocates in Washington State to establish a "right-hand" bike lane. The lane is limited to
