aghan County Museum, have teamed up to offer free, interactive exhibits that tell part of the story of "Bloody Monday" on the Western Front.

Cynthia and John Burt, whose children's father was killed by a shell whilst working for the Royal Munitions Factory on the Somme, created the project after visiting the National Military Museum in London on their trip there.

Sinn Féin MP Dr. Gerry Adams joined his parents for the unveiling of the project and praised it as a "real moment of healing".

"It is my hope that it will bring to attention not only the sacrifices of those who did not return, but also of those of my people who also bore the brunt of the fighting on the Western Front," said Dr. Adams.

Tours of the museum will take place from 10am on Friday, 14 September; 10am on Saturday, 15 September; 9am on Sunday, 16th September; 10am on Sunday, 17th September; 10am on Monday, 18th September; and from 3–6pm on Wednesday, 19th September. All times are approximate.

The museum is open from 10am to 6pm on Monday, 18th September.
