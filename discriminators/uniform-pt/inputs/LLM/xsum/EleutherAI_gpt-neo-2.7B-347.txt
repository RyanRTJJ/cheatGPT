 tackle dangerous companies operating in the UK.

The operation has already led to the seizure of more than Â£80m and at one time even had the approval of the Home Office's top brass.

The targets were linked to several cases, including prostitution, which is considered an offshoot of the black market.

The Home Secretary's announcement to seize the bars came as the BBC's Panorama programme exposed the government's failure to make a single arrest in a decade's worth of enquiries after the raids.

Scotland Yard previously insisted there were no drugs and prostitution trading cases to be linked to those in the raids, leading to criticism that the operation was a "political witch-hunt".

The BBC Panorama programme highlighted raids in 2012 and 2013, and the government had repeatedly attempted to get a handle on illegal drugs cases associated with the nail bars.

But the government's own figures - obtained by the BBC - suggest many of those involved in organised black market activities remain unmolested and can continue to do so.

The same source, who is in receipt of information because of a personal confidence initiative, said that since 2012 there have been more than 160 arrests for offences linked to the illegal trade being conducted in the nail bars. But no senior figure from the Home Office has been prosecuted in connection with the raids.

Ministers have defended their operation as one that will result in the removal of "high-risk" businesses and prevent the recruitment of "unwarranted sex workers".

The government is also concerned that companies involved in such activities remain open and are "unable to take on new people".
