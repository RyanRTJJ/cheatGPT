 for China, greater transparency, enforcement and verification at all stages, and protection of human rights

An Open Letter from American Policymakers and Global Scholars

Dear Madam Secretary,

We write in support of your agreement with China on the North Korea crisis and as leading experts in nuclear proliferation, foreign policy, and human rights in Asia.

The most important point to understand about this agreement is that America is not “pulling a China.” It is negotiating with a different and more hostile country and a strategic partner. The U.S. cannot get China to engage in negotiations or to accept its terms without making substantial concessions. That is one of the reasons why the agreement is much weaker than it should be.

China is also not in a position, and therefore unlikely, to demand that the U.S. take steps toward withdrawal without a credible agreement in hand. The United States must make a credible agreement before the deadline on “denuclearization” as China has insisted on the term, and with real measures and verification to follow. The U.S. can continue to work toward nuclear disarmament, but not if the price of achieving that goal is a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula.

U.S. goals in the negotiations have included:

- The nuclear problem that Kim Jong Un’s regime has manufactured through fission-fusion weapons development.

- Concrete steps toward denuclearizing North Korea, leading to the elimination of all nuclear weapons.

- Stabilization of the relationship that now, after 70 years of hostility, allows us to begin to have frank discussions on issues of common import to the people of Korea and the Asia-Pacific region.

The U.S. will continue to engage in cooperation with North Korea to advance its security, while maintaining our goal of denuclearization. This process will not end the sanctions regime, or eliminate the regime’s nuclear weapons, but it will begin to reduce tensions, and create the conditions for stability and peace in East Asia.

We applaud the agreement reached with China to “work towards” a denuclearization of North Korea, with measures being taken to verify
