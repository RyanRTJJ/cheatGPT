 the job," said Strachan. "Even if we fail, we have probably got the best player in the world."

Asked if he thought the FA would stand by Strachan even if he was sacked, the Scot responded: "At this moment in time that's the intention but it's not over yet."

A report in the Press Association suggested the FA was in talks this weekend with Strachan over a new contract.

But Strachan said he was a little disappointed that he appeared to have caused problems for the England Under-21s coach Stuart Pearce and the chief executive, Mark Palaszewski.

"He did say to me: 'Can you meet me for lunch on Monday?' in a joking way," said Strachan. "I was a bit surprised when I saw the paper. I'm not a politician. That's not my job. They have their opinion and I'll have mine.

"They have no understanding of me doing any job for an Under-21s team now or later. I have enough pressure in my job, you have to be a bit careful who takes a shot like that."

Strachan said he had talked to the FA about his future once he started thinking about the fact that qualification for the under-21s World Cup in the summer was still in his hands.

"If I had a good season, I'd be under pressure for no reason," he said. "As I get more and more into the job, the more and more pressure I'd put on my shoulders. But I would like to get out of it."

The other four major sports -- cricket, football, rugby union and athletics -- have been under pressure this World Cup cycle from their national federations to clean up their games or face the risk of being removed from the quadrennial event.

In football, the FA's "plan A" is to have a major new academy system in place for next season to give young players the experience of playing football week-in, week-out.

Strachan knows that while that is a good option, it does put players under pressure to perform, as they are playing at a higher level than at club level.
