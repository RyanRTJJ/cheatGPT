 went to Edinburgh to talk to some of those affected by the referendum and discover how they live their lives in the years after a decision was made.

What do you think of the future Scotland?

Dundee man Stephen Murray, 48:

"I could be pretty happy if people think well, what's the future for Scotland?"

"The world has changed in the last eight years"

"The SNP has got what they wanted from the independence referendum - that we would have a bigger say in Scotland in the world."

"They took the opportunity of not having to answer all the questions again and they decided to go out and get our best educated and brightest people and bring them into Westminster and the civil service."

"There are some people in Westminster who don't like the SNP (who) didn't give them any credit for what they've done. That it wasn't their victory."

John Tisdall, 59:

"I see it as a new day. People can now express political opinions that once wouldn't have been acceptable. People can stand back and watch the world develop and see the UK as a unified entity.

"In fact, I wouldn't be shocked if within the next five or 10 years it was like a single market.

"There's been a change in attitudes. People feel a bit more comfortable now."

Alexi Sutherland, 65:

"When you look at the world today and the opportunities available to people, if we didn't control our borders we would be in deep trouble today.

"If we didn't get independence from a Unionist state we would be back in a war with another, and probably much worse."

And Andrew McCallum, 44:

"We're a society of individuals, and that has been going on since time immemorial. It has been based on personal decision making rather than a collective decision based on a central body."

Mr McAllum - director of corporate training at Arup and a prominent business campaigner - is a supporter of the Yes campaign and is happy with the result.
