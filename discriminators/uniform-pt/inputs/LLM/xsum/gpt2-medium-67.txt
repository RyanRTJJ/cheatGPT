The car company confirmed it had no involvement in "an incident that apparently happened at a Ferrari dealer in Switzerland this afternoon".

Ferrari said it had "no information" about the incident other than the Swiss carmaker confirming a report by BBC Sport. The website reported the incident did not take place.

A spokesperson said: "At Ferrari we pride ourselves on being accessible to all. Our car dealers throughout Europe are always open to us. While there have been reports of customers getting the wrong number of tickets for a private event in Switzerland, we urge anyone who has had an experience relating to the wrong number of Ferrari sales to come forward immediately. Any further comment, and if the issue has not arisen by then, we will direct you to the customer as requested."

Swiss authorities have said many Ferrari salesmen did not always pay proper prices.

Swiss magazine "Dreich" suggested on its Facebook page it was all part of a vendetta by former F1 and world champion Daniel Ricciardo against Ferrari. The former driver and ex-world champion has been a Ferrari customer for over four decades.

Swiss police launched an investigation today after a "small-scale street collision" with a Ferrari dealership last night outside Leipzig.

The newspaper, quoting a "minor problem with the car", said a driver tried to pass a Ferrari salesman inside and hit the front and rear tires, breaking a window. He was then arrested and taken to hospital, according to the Bild daily.

But the carmaker was not involved and both men are said to have been released from hospital as the investigation continued.

Ferrari had previously confirmed on Monday that a "slightly" injured driver had caused a problem at one of its stores in Munich in November and had been removed. It had issued no statement.

Giorgio G-Force - the owner of the Ferrari brand and the man behind Formula One team G-Force - says he had received a similar customer complaint on Tuesday evening. He
