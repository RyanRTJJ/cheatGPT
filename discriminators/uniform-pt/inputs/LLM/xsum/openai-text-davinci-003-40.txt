ervice report revealed a sharp rise in violence in prisons across England and Wales.

Prof Hardwick, who is the chair of the Independent Monitoring Board, said that the increasing violence in prisons was “deeply worrying” and had to be addressed. He said there had been “a tipping point” in the last year, with a noticeable increase in the number of violent incidents, self-harm and suicides.

The rise in violence and self-harm had been attributed to stretched resources and overcrowding, but the Professor believes there are other factors at play. He suggested that prisons were struggling to cope because of a shift in attitudes towards criminal justice. He said “You can’t oversee an overcrowded prison and pretend it’s a normal prison...Staff don’t feel supported, inmates don’t feel valued. Locking up large amounts of people and not investing in support staff or prisoner activities has led to a critical level of pressure.”

He also cited the effects of austerity measures, cuts to legal aid, and changes to the system that reduced the incentives for prisoners to behave productively and obey instructions. He said it was essential to invest in early intervention and community justice programmes, as well as in prison staff and prisons themselves, to support rehabilitation and prevent violence. 

He concluded his lecture by saying that “the current situation is a result of systemic failure, and systemic change is needed to turn it around”.
