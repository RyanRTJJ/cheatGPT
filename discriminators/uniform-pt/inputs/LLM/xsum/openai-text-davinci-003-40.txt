Marine Management Organisation (MMO) works with partners to ensure the marine environment, commercial activities, coastal communities and recreational users are appropriately looked after.

The MMO encourages people to respect the environment and ensure that any activities pushed ahead do not harm the environment. It also enforces rules to prevent cohabitation with protected species. The organisation works collaboratively with the public to ensure that developments in and around the marine environment are sustainable. It also has a ‘Love the Oceans’ campaign which raises awareness of marine environmental protection and encourages people to make sustainable choices for the benefit of the whole marine system. 

As part of the legislation, the MMO works with local authorities, businesses and other organisations to ensure relevant activities are not damaging the environment. Key to this is monitoring of industries and putting in place regulations which control the way activities can be conducted in and around coastal areas. These regulations cover areas such as the disposal of waste, the use of chemicals and the protection of the marine habitats.

The UK government’s Marine Strategy Framework Directive also commits all states in the European Union to meet agreed targets to improve its marine environment. The MMO works to ensure this framework is adhered to, encouraging industry to take responsibility for its activities. 

The MMO works closely with the Natural England, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Environment Agency and other conservation organisations to ensure everyone is working to protect the marine environment. This includes identifying any potential risks and carrying out research to assess the impact of developments like offshore renewable energy or fishery industries. It also drives forward the Marine Protected Area network, creating sanctuaries where habitats can be conserved and protected for future generations.
