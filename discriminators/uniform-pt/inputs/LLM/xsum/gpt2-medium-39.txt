 guilty verdicts and three would have to wait for sentencing.

She said they had heard "a lot of evidence and a fair amount of circumstantial evidence". She said there was "a very difficult question to answer at this point for some of the jurors that may come to court. Was it a premeditated murder, was it an elaborate deception, was it murder? I think the jury would have to come to an alternative view."

She refused to say whether there was evidence of self-defence.

The jury was told the victims had suffered terrible beating, including broken bones, punctures in the neck, and stab wounds in various parts of the body that had needed to be cleaned. They had been bound and had been locked in a kitchen that had lain unused for years.

There were video recordings of the murder, allegedly filmed by one of the suspects - an English dual British and German national with a "well-known" criminal record.

Mr Wesselberg told jurors that Ms Tinkler was a "brilliant, intelligent, outgoing young woman", whom he described being involved in "all sorts of activities".

He had never met Ms Tinkler, said the forewoman, but was told she had "participated in many activities with the others".

On 3 May, the four men began interrogating one of the two women, a 33-year-old mother-of-two, and four other men in a locked door in an area of Toulouse-Sainte-Foy. The trial was adjourned until 8 August when the woman sought permission from the judge.

One of the men called his sister while another held a knife to her neck. He said he wanted to take his sister's life because she was a "crazy woman who's doing all sorts of activities" with her sister and was jealous of the other two. Two of the men took notes, the forewoman said, although she declined to say who had the written notes.
