 preparation for players involved in tournaments. The squad, which will be boosted by the return of Celtic midfielder Callum McGregor from injury, have a game on Saturday against Kilmarnock. There are more friendly games coming up to ensure the players are mentally and physically prepared.

“We know now we must prepare in a proper way,” says Strachan. “We have to try and get the right balance.”

Might Celtic’s return to training on Thursday help the players?

“We could have the first team available and the players will go to Hampden. The good news is we have a number of players who haven’t played on the big stage. The club has brought a good chunk of players who are probably ready to play international football, if they weren’t quite ready for the intensity of the Europa League.

“The big thing for us is to get a settled squad ready to take us forward.”

Strachan acknowledges that a big advantage was the fact Celtic were playing in the Champions League qualifiers in July. The players were at full health and the level of competition was lower.

He believes all of Celtic’s top four rivals have been on tour recently.

“The level of football has been higher than the qualifiers,” says Strachan. “There have been games with big European names such as AC Milan. As a manager, I’d rather play those games early. Hopefully that will put us in good stead.”

At the end of the campaign, Celtic were still in with a chance of winning the league. Will the players now take that into the campaign proper?

“It will help,” says Strachan. “Players can be better prepared for their own club. At Celtic, you are expected to do well. For the team to do well, you are expected to do well. It is a big step-up of intensity and of level of play. If you’ve played on that level for a few weeks, it might mean you can step it up a bit in a bit longer.”
