 made the prototype by weaving it into a web made of carbon, a material with a strong solar surface effect. It will not allow light to pass directly through or over it or cause any of its tiny internal heaters to malfunction.

The Webb telescope, set to launch at the end of 2018, will be the most powerful space observatory ever built: it will be able to detect planets, comets and large asteroids that might harbour life. The telescope will be able to spot the faintest stars and galaxies, and may even pick up "wobbling" in distant quasars â€“ where the glow of a quasar brightens and dims over time.

James Webb's mirror will be made of a high-strength and durable material called carbon nanotubes, which are much stronger than steel and are so transparent they can be embedded in a material that can deflect light. The mirrors themselves will be coated in a protective film made from anionic materials, such as aluminium oxide.

Wearable glasses will be attached to the front of the spacecraft. Scientists will use these to look at objects in our immediate neighbourhood that the light of the Sun cannot reach directly, such as asteroids and the atmospheres of comets. They will also need to look further afield, where objects faint enough to be hidden by the glare of the Sun will appear with their distinctive colors on infrared images.

"The spectroscopy from a James Webb might look a bit like looking at a moving target but you didn't get hurt," said Peter Seewald, a physicist at the University of Warwick. "We're on a path to build big, fast, very powerful solar systems. The Webb telescope is going to provide that kind of capability."

Scientists aim to use the Webb telescope mainly to hunt for Earth-like planets around the same size as ours, and not for other extrasolar worlds. That could include bodies that orbit stars as hot as our sun, or similar objects that are too distant from their
