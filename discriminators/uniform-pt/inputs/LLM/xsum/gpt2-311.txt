 of a huge bottle of champagne at the Cubs game that they won despite the US having been able to keep a single American football player under 100 at World Cup qualifier.

"Our biggest problem today is the media. We're out of control. We've lost millions," Cubs general manager Jed Hoyer told reporters prior to the game in Chicago's Polo Grounds. "So we've lost our fans. There's been a massive media blackout."

And despite this, Hoyer was happy he was the first to throw an MVP trophy to the president. "Today the American people have it, we've won. I just want to thank everybody who's been so supportive," Hoyer said. "The message's on the stadium."

The Cubs will continue to try to rally supporters from stadiums that won't allow the first team to host the national championship. The Nationals are working on a deal that would enable them to host a third World Cup. After the Nationals failed to score a run in their last one, they will be able to play the best team in the World Cup to date and possibly play in the next four years.

"The Americans deserve to play in this and I can't imagine anything worse to happen," Hoyer said, after an impressive start.

There is nothing better than the American people, you see, when fans can go to the local bar after a home game and see fans of all stripes there cheering on the team and cheering for the team. It's an American way of life, and it's been going on all this year.
