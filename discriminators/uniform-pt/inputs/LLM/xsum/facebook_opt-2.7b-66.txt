 of Ireland parish and the Church of Ireland is an equal partnership partnership in governance. But under a new proposal being canvased there would be a merger of the two parishes because Desertmartin is currently in a bad financial position. But Knocknagin is in an even more precarious position because it is in steep decline.

Speaking on BBC Antrim FM the Lord Bishop of Dromore, Rev Patrick Mulligan, said that Church of Ireland parishes are often in great difficulty because of secular factors.

Rev Mulligan said: “The key driver for the merging of the Church of Ireland parishes which are desertmartin and Knocknagin here would be if we felt that we could provide more opportunities for people’s physical and spiritual well-being and their spiritual integration then we would be very happy to look at it.”

He added: “When you look at places like Knock, Castlefinn, Ballymena which have a deep sense of Catholic identity they do really well in terms of physical well-being, social well-being, spiritual well-being and I think that the Church of Ireland is really important in creating those centres of spiritual well-being in the parishes that already have them. We are interested in continuing building on those.”

But Rev Patrick Mulligan said that the Church of Ireland must also look to secular factors: “My experience of the Church of Ireland community is that the people who live in those parishes, the ones who feel Catholic identity and Catholicism very deeply are the people who care deeply for their children and the people who care deeply for their neighbours, and we need to continue to nurture that in our Church of Ireland.”

Rev Mulligan also expressed surprise that parishes in Northern Ireland are not more tightly linked than parish communities in the Republic of Ireland: “People say to me why can’t we be more active? I think the Church of Ireland in Northern Ireland would be a lot better if they were linked more closely to their fellow Church of Ireland parishes in the Republic”.
