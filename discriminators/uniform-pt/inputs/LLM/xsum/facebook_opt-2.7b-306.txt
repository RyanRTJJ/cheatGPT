 campaign has brought tensions with the media across France.

In a tweet she suggested they needed to "face reality". "There are many more people than (these) who hate the burkini, and there are many others who like it. Let's not be too judgemental," she wrote.

On Monday a court in the town of Valence was hearing a case brought by a local woman challenging a ban on burkinis on public beaches, part of measures to combat terrorism

French newspapers are frequently at odds with President François Hollande and his government. On Wednesday, L'Obs reported that Hollande will not attend the awards ceremony at the Elysee Palace on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, in the east, the "burkini day" campaign is gaining momentum. Earlier on Wednesday, two demonstrators in Marseille wore the burkinis they wore in the Mediterranean the previous Sunday. They were held with placards expressing support for the hijab and for the prophet Muhammad.

Also on Wednesday, a woman whose bikini cover was torn off by police at a beach in Guadeloupe last month was fined by a court in Nice.

On Monday, after a number of local papers reported pictures of two teenagers in black-and-white swimsuits, the interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, described the pictures as "a provocation".

The "burkini day" campaign has put pressure on Hollande to address the issue in his weekly address on Saturday. He said during a visit to a French military hospital on Tuesday that he was "not going to discuss matters that I have to stay silent about".

• This article was amended on 22 August 2016 to reflect that the judge in the Valence case only fined the two teenagers £150. A court in Nice overturned a ruling by a police officer that the two teenagers in black-and-white swimsuits were insulting to Islam and the Prophet Muhammad, allowing them to leave the scene after being charged with disturbing the peace. This has been correct.
