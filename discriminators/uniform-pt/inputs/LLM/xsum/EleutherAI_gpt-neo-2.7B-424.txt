 him after the French side's second successive Champions League final, took charge at the beginning of this season.

The former Olympique Lyon boss spoke after the 1-0 semi-final second-leg defeat to Bayern Munich and said Bayern did not offer "the spectacle of a cup final".

"But when I went to the locker room, they brought two trophies in my hands, because they really believed that they were going to make it," he added.

"As a manager, you go to the dressing room and it feels like you need to cry. But the moment when they did the most is when you get that trophy they were waiting for.

"It is very important to get that trophy. It will mean lots of things. Maybe it will be the turning point for the team and we will move forward.

"It is an unbelievable moment for the club, for all the club."

Bayern went to Paris with the Champions League holders having been drawn against the first five sides in the draw.

However, a win on Saturday night would put the German champions 1-0 up over holders Atl√©tico Madrid in the other semi with Chelsea and Manchester City facing them in the other semi-final - which takes place six days later. Bayern's first goal of the campaign came in their 4-2 victory at the Emirates Stadium in March, and they have gone on an 18-match unbeaten run at home in all competitions.

Simeone said he was confident of overcoming the deficit.

"They (Bayern) can play one of the best football in the world because they have always been the best teams in the world," said the Argentine.

"It is going to be an unbelievable game and if it goes through two-nil or three-nil, I will be happy. This is not going to be easy."

Chelsea will also be seeking the same type of result, with Bayern going to Berlin on Tuesday to face Dnipro.
