But he added: "I have always felt that by providing good service to its customers with a great design people love, the ENO is a successful company, not the cause of it."

In an email statement, ENO said its customers had asked for a different experience and it apologised for any offence caused.

"ENO has listened to and provided feedback to its customers. When it felt that we had delivered sufficient customer satisfaction the organisation chose to close the business and exit all of our staff and its customers."

The business, which had operated for around 40 years, made the decision on Thursday to close shop.

An earlier statement said: "ENO is disappointed to have made this decision. Our customers gave us a genuine and exceptional service which, although initially disappointing, has allowed us to remain in business and remain highly qualified for all of ENO's future needs."

ENO has been in business since 1909.
