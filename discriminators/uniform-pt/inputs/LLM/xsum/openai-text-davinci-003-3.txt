r more nature recovery networks to be established across the country, which would enable the conservation of Scotland’s natural habitats and species. It also calls for a focus on green infrastructure, such as green roofs and urban parks, enhanced public funding for nature conservation, and new standards of protection.

The main focus of the report is Scotland’s poorly-performed nature recovery networks, which are intended to make sure that Scotland is creating and maintaining sufficient networks of functional habitats and spaces for wildlife to cope with climate change.

The report calls for a £50 million Nature Recovery Fund to reverse the decline of Scotland’s biodiversity, with £20 million of this to be made available through central government allotment. It also recommends raising or lifting funding for existing schemes by £30 million a year.

Other recommendations made in the report include establishing a Nature Recovery Centre, mapping Scotland’s natural habitats, creating a national system of strategic landscape management and increased public support for nature protection. It also calls for expanding the Natural Capital Plan to include a Nature Investment Strategy as well as establishing a Biodiversity Commission to monitor progress towards nature restoration targets.

The report also urges the Scottish government to ensure that it is using its powers under the European Convention on Human Rights to protect nature and ecosystems. It calls for a comprehensive review of the country's nature policies and laws, with a focus on incorporating biodiversity into all aspects of strategy.

The urgent calls contained in the report reflect the reality of the environmental crisis that is facing Scotland. With a vision of restoring and enhancing nature based on love, respect and collaboration, the recommendations made represent a vital step in the journey to ensuring Scotland’s natural heritage is better protected.
