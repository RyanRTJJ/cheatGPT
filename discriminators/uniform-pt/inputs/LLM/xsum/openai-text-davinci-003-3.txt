 the first time since 2011 vinyl outsold digital downloads.

The ERA’s figures for 2018 showed vinyl sales grew by 21.8%, reaching an 11-year high of 4.2 million units sold. Meanwhile, downloads continued an ongoing slump, down a massive 28.8%.

Vinyl’s resurgence has been driven by a number of factors, including the growing popularity of ‘vinyl snobbery’ among music fans eager to own a physical record as well as enjoy its higher sound quality compared to MP3s. 

7-inch singles have been particularly popular, while the increasing adoption of streaming technology has allowed people to explore vast catalogues of music and has helped to drive vinyl sales. 

Increasing availability of new releases on vinyl is also proving attractive to music fans. Many albums now come with exclusive coloured editions and limited edition box sets, while some stores are also creating their own exclusive bundles.

It is not just the young crowd that is embracing vinyl either. The ERA found that sales to 35-54 year olds had reached an all-time high, accounting for 34% of total sales. 

The era said that investment in the format has helped to bolster its revival, with more physical retailers stocking the format, and a wider range of vinyl being made available throughout the year.

Vinyl’s resurgence has been so dramatic that it now accounts for almost a third of physical music sales, whereas at its lowest point, back in 2007, it accounted for just 3.2%.
