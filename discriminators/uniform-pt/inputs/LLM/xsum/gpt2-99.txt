The inquiry, which was chaired by the former chairman of the UK's biggest security firm who spent 12 years as the chief executive officer of British intelligence and has been criticised for politicising the matter, will look into any potential links between GCHQ and the NIS in the past, it was told.

The GCHQ-run GCHQ Strategic Intelligence Service is a British agency that is designed to be able to conduct covert surveillance on targets within its territory.

A former director general, Sir Richard Dearlove, said he was shocked by the scale of the accusations against GCHQ. He said of the agency: "I don't think GCHQ really had a coherent program … it was such a complicated and very complex operation. And that is why the NIS did not work as well as it did – because it was so complicated.

"It was designed to take huge amounts of detail out of your interactions with friends and family and take away information that the spy agency could use to develop intelligence on its own."

He said the NIS would examine other intelligence sources and methods, including those developed by
