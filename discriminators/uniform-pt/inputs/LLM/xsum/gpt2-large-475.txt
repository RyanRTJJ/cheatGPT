 into his half-time cameo was a brilliant piece of football.

"I don't know if it was a great piece of football [the goal]. I am sorry to all the players involved but if you can't find goals that work, it is not going to work."

On the importance of playing attractive football, he adds: "I think we have played pretty good football for a very long time."

On their failure to score, McClaren admits, "I don't know if it wasn't our work. We had a lot of crosses in. We had quite an interesting time trying to get off the line. We thought we had it in the back of our mind that we could get it from one of our outside backs. They tried their best."

He adds: "We were a bit unlucky not to score and have seen that they would score quite easily when they had balls in. At times we did go a little bit too long and we could be a little more direct into the box. We had some good challenges from Denni, it wasn't a lot but it was a pretty entertaining fixture."

On referee Howard Webb making four red cards before the end of the first half, he says: "I don't know if that was quite his fault or not. I don't think so really. I don't consider ourselves in any doubt that we were the better team."

When asked if it was a lesson for them, he smiles: "We would have liked to have drawn at least one game. We were better at our usual style of play than we were against Manchester United - I am not going to say we were worse, but that one was a little bit different.

"I think he was frustrated with us a few times and at the end of it he got four cards and probably made some decisions that were going to have consequences for certain players for our future on the pitch. I don't think the game is over.
