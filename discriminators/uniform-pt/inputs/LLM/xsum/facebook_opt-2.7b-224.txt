All five were treated at Liverpool’s Aintree University Hospital. Two of the five girls are in a serious but stable condition. The remaining three girls were discharged from hospital.

A spokesman for Merseyside Police said the girls have been charged with road traffic offences, including attempted murder.

“This is a shocking case of road traffic collision in which five young people were hurt,” he said. “A witness stated to the police that he had seen two male occupants get out of the white Seat Toledo. He said he ran to a nearby motorway service area when he saw two people run off the road into a wooded area.”

The spokesman added: “The witness saw the girl who was run down in the road. The pair left the vehicle, walked into the woods and were last seen on a footpath.”

The Seat Toledo involved in the crash has not been found. It has not been reported if anyone has claimed the vehicle after the crash.

Merseyside police believe someone in the car fled the scene in the direction of the A56, but have declined to confirm if the passengers were wearing seat belt.

The force is appealing for anyone who knows anything about anyone involved in the incident to come forward.

“We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area or driving at the time of the incident and who saw something suspicious,” the spokesman added.

The accident took place on the day of a music festival, but police believe this could not be a factor in the crash. Investigators are looking into whether alcohol played a part, but the force will not close its door to other possibilities.

The girls are from Belvidere Road, and investigators are working to identify their friends, as well as the man who tried to speed off. They have also appealed for witnesses in the immediate area to come forward.
