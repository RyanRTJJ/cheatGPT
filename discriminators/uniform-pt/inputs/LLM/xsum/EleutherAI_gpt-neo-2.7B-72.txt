In this case, Mr Perry says he never actually received the money he was promised and he only realised these alleged crimes when the scam became public in November 2014 when he was threatened with police action to reclaim the funds.

He had been contacted by the scammers via his dad's work email account, where they were able to direct his dad to make a transaction to pay off a large outstanding amount.

In the days before this, Mr Perry had asked his dad if they were safe. His father, who was overseas at the time, said the email message said his account had been compromised.

Now he is trying to raise the money to support him and his family, having been forced into accepting the scam in the first place, and to stop his dad - who is suffering from mental illness - from suffering the trauma of the scam and financial loss.
