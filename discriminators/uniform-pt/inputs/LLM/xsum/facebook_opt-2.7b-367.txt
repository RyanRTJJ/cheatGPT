 to put the sign on the wall of what would once have been the world's largest Christmas tree.

The construction of the tree began in August and continued over the festive period. It stands 6.3 m (21ft) tall and is decorated with a million plastic ornaments in the shape of a tree. It will be lit up for the festive season.

Ballas said he planned to put up more trees, but could not be certain it would be possible before he went to Italy for a wedding in February. He plans to turn the space where the tree is housed into a bar. He is considering using the ornaments to decorate a wall.

The tree will be lit for Christmas Eve, but the star will be installed again on 5 January, one of the busiest nights of the year.
