The Northern Ireland Assembly is considering bringing in a system of random saliva testing for Covid-19, on a trial basis, as officials believe that the method of testing is more effective than the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which has been the most widely used test for over two years.

On Monday the government said that the average number of tests processed in Northern Ireland over the weekend was 1,566 -- up from 870 the week before -- but the total was up against a small testing capacity. The test on Saturday was the first time that anyone in Northern Ireland, except those over the age of 70, was tested with the new rapid test kit.

While the number of tests processed in Northern Ireland has almost doubled over the last two weeks, figures show that the daily average over the weekend was still at about one-eighth of the level required to bring the rate of positivity down to the levels considered to be "herd immunity."

The current positivity rate in Northern Ireland is about 9.5%, but even this figure could be significantly higher as it does not take into account people not getting tested and not being reported as positive.

On the basis that 100,000 people would need to be tested on a daily basis to reach herd immunity, this means that current testing capacity, over the full two weeks since the virus was seen in Northern Ireland, should bring positivity down to about 7%.

Testing more people might yield many more positives but officials believe the rate of positivity would then fall accordingly. This is because the higher the level of positivity, the lower the amount of testing required to bring it down by the standard.

The new rapid test kits, which were introduced to frontline staff over the weekend, are more than double the size of the more than one million kits currently in use in the UK.
