 had earlier refused to identify the injured man for fear of reprisals, but the case has made the international news.

“I was in a chair with a doctor and the guard standing next to me,” Asghar told reporters as he lay in an induced coma in hospital. “The guard fired five bullets at me and I fell down on the floor.”

He said the guards had turned up late because they were looking for him for a “short” time. “No notice was issued or call was made,” he added.

The guards, whom he said had no weapons licence, were “on call”. “They were called and rushed there immediately,” said Asghar, who added that he had not had weapons licence and carried a pistol, registered with the government, in his possession with no licence.

The case has again highlighted longstanding concerns over police use of force inside and outside jails in Pakistan where the rule of law is weak and the legal framework often flouted or abused.

While Asghar said he did not know who had ordered his shooting, “one of the guards told me he had instructions from his seniors to shoot me”. He said he could not confirm who had given the orders.

Asghar said he had been shot once in the chest with the pistol, then twice more with a rifle and finally, as he lay lying on the floor, 11 other shots were fired.

“It was an automatic rifle and was shot from close range,” said Asghar, adding that he had suffered fractures on his back, chest and arm and could not move his legs or hands.

“The guards were instructed not to let me recover in hospital because they wanted me to die,” he added.

Asghar, who said he had been at Adiala jail for nine months after being sentenced for the murder of a Pakistani policeman, was released last month pending appeal. He was due to be transferred from a jail in Rawalpindi to the central city of Lahore.

His imprisonment at Adiala has sparked widespread support
