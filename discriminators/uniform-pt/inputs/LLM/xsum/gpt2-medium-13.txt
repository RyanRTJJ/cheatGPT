 the Department of Electrical Engineering and Applied Sciences at Cardiff University took RGC from the beginning.

The project involves a unique hybrid energy solution based on energy flow from a small generator which generates electricity to the rest of the structure using a mixture of wind power and solar panels. There are 12 turbines, which generate 12kW, and the energy used by each rotor only requires 2kW. It's an integrated system which can deliver up to 1GW of energy into each local building.

The project currently takes four hours to build, and needs six weeks of work.

It will generate 30kW per turbine, which is enough power to power the entire Welsh Electric System for 5 hours with just one power inverter. That means the project could have the capacity to meet the needs of 150,000 households.

As part of the project Dr Jonathan Williams, the principal engineer at ARBET, said: "The fact the structure can even work this smoothly, with only the wind powering the entire system when the wind is off, demonstrates the potential to use sustainable energy as a building material that could reduce emissions, not just as a building material as a building material.

"Building material makers may use more efficient products but we hope this project could see energy from these wind turbines transformed into more energy, helping to reduce pollution, increase social well-being and produce greener housing."

A video from a recent seminar in New York shows how a 3G energy converter can produce clean energy from 5MW of wind turbines without running up huge construction costs. This will also provide a green alternative for more efficient construction methods.

This unique Hybrid Energy Power Systems technology could reduce emissions considerably. The project is currently running at a small scale, and will continue in phases once the feasibility findings and data on wind turbines are accepted by the Welsh government.

This is a high-risk project but I'm confident this can be done. That said the project is a first, in terms of demonstrating viable energy generation.
