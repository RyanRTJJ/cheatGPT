European Commission officials are also concerned by the possibility of more deaths from the Balkans crossing to Greece, but fear that if any come from this route, EU countries will eventually be overwhelmed.

Most of those who have died trying to enter Italy, however, came from Syria. Last week the Italian coastguard said at least three people had drowned when they crossed the Aegean during a two-day journey from Turkey in boats that could only carry up to 80 passengers.

It was only when a rescue boat from Italy's southern region of Murcia picked them up that it became clear it was the migrants who had lost contact with the coastguard and the island's authorities.
