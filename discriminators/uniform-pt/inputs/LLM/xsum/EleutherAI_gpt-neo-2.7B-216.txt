 looked after in Bogota, but that it did not explain what that meant.

Ms Reid left the South American country five years ago after getting involved in the gay marriage campaign. She now lives abroad.

Reaction: The Foreign Office has said on Twitter that Ms Reid is receiving "all necessary care and support".

This news comes after her mother issued a message on her daughter's Facebook page last week that said: "It breaks my heart and saddens my heart to see my beloved baby grow up and leave me, but my faith is bigger than any one person but me.

"There are thousands of Christians and faithful followers from around the world who love Melissa. They are her family and will be there to support her every step of the way.

"I know that Melissa could not foresee this but I'm asking that we pray for her and the entire family. May we all be reminded that Melissa is no ordinary girl and is not any ordinary person, but a princess in Christ's Kingdom.‚Äù

Another message read: "In response to the 'gay marriage' issue, I also wish her all the best in her life".

It is understood that Ms Reid is not a target of Colombia's gay hate campaign.

The UN's human rights office has said it is concerned by the wave of killings in recent weeks - in Bogota and other Colombian cities - which are thought to be linked to the campaign.

In May and June 2011, at least 10 gay people were slaughtered in Colombia.

The LGBT community in Colombia, fearing renewed attacks from anti-gay groups, decided to run the names and pictures of some victims of the massacres on billboards and in social media to draw attention to the attacks.

The Foreign Office has also published a statement saying: "The Foreign and Commonwealth Office makes no apology for the fact that it is sometimes difficult to understand the positions of countries when it comes to the international human rights and democracy agenda, and we will continue to monitor developments on this issue."
