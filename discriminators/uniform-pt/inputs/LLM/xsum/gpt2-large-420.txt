 brightest in Britain have an average of 15.1 places at top universities. Only 16% of that number are in the top quartile according to the latest ONS data.

While the report said more could be done to attract the brightest and the brightest to higher education, the report pointed out that there was plenty more to do given there was already evidence that the top universities in this country have a highly skewed "age-prior achievement test" when placing their best students. In a new report on the state of university teaching, leading experts in education say that the problem is "deeply entrenched" as a result of the "lack of attention given to the role of education, rather than the role of state spending."

"You might have noticed that in this recession, Britain has a huge amount of people in their late 30s and early 40s doing unpaid work in part-time jobs; this is a problem because it means they are not starting a career so they aren't doing the apprenticeships that our system would like."

The report, published this week, is based on the most recent data obtained from the Higher Education Statistics Agency on admissions to degree courses in England to students aged 17-24. The research carried out for the ICA by the Institute of Economic Affairs is the first since the government committed in 2011 to improving students' chances of finding full time work by raising the level of apprenticeship. It follows the publication by the ICA of their own work, which found that students who went on to study at university were more likely to be given part-time work than the same age-group in recent years.

Andrew Glyn, Professor of Education and Skills at the ICA, said: "There are significant challenges in achieving that, particularly if you are just starting out. The problem is there is more going on than we are seeing."

His research showed that the number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds in the top of their school course had fallen by 22% within the past decade, down from an average annual rise of 3% between 2000 and 2008. This was driven in the majority of cases not by a drop in
