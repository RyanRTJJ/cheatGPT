SEs than in 2009. In the north there have been 13 more GCEs, and 14 more A-levels.

Pupils in the north-east earn a "wonderful" level three in their Science A-level, and a three in Biology. In the south, these are "dramatically weaker grades", says Duncan, who believes the difference is because fewer young people attend GCSEs in local authorities in the north and the south-east, which have high levels of social media and are known for having poor results. These forces will continue to hold back GCSE results, he believes.

"There's no doubt that if the schools are being criticised it is because these boys don't know exactly what they're doing. If schools are getting their targets right, they are getting that. These things are happening on a day to day basis," he says.

One approach to improving performance in London and Durham is to encourage parents to send their children to academies, a long overdue move that would boost a local economy and help to boost the quality of classes and a student's chances of success. Some councils might be able to help parents make this happen, but for many, the reality is that for every student in a free-school school, there is an equally young student in the country's poorest district primary school (the Bexleyheights).

It is not clear that this new approach to promoting the best future for every child would improve exam results. For all its promise, Mr Duncan thinks its long-term effect depends on whether academies increase demand for GCSEs and A-levels so schools can retain experienced teachers and resources.

When he became education secretary, he encouraged more than Â£100m for the National Curriculum, an ambitious programme to boost the local curriculum of every school by 2019. The aim is to achieve more than 50% of all primary pupils, up from 31% in 2015-16. Yet at present just 23% of the 16-to and 17-year-olds who
