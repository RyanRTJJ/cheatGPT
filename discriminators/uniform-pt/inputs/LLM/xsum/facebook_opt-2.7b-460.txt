ricably linked.
I'm fine if it's just the two and it's pretty obvious that they have nothing to do with each other.   However, the IOC has banned Russia from the games because of this law.  If athletes have nothing to do with this law, they shouldn't have to abide by it.  I don't see people in this sub supporting that.
I think they should still be allowed to compete internationally while Russia continues being corrupt with an unjustified law. That's a slippery slope though.
Shouldn't an athlete forfeit their medal? If you were accused of assault and murder, would you forfeit your medal and keep playing?
No one was accusing you of murder.
He wasnt, but some people claim to be victims of the law
Like the gay people in Russia.
Which means nothing. I didn't say anything about whether gay people were righted under the law, they just had the right to live their lives if they are that way, and it's against the law to make anti-gay statements. They were targeted by the government for no reason.   Just because you support a law does not justify your actions, so you can say whatever the fuck you want about gay people living their lives if you're OK with killing them.
> It's against the law to make anti-gay statements.   So are anti-semitism, pedophilia, and any form of discrimination. You're choosing to ignore that, so...  This is the exact reason there needs to be punishment for being a horrible monster. That's not happening. The law itself is the punishment, not the individual.
How does my point contradict yours? Just because something isn't a criminal act doesn't mean you have to like it.   And the idea that hate crimes shouldn't be punished in a country that hates and discriminates against them is really fucking silly
