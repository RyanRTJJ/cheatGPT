Deliveroo declined to answer questions on the incidents, saying it was not in the business of commenting on rider safety. However, it did call the London attacks an "opportunistic, opportunistic crime", saying it "regrets" it happened.

In response to a Freedom of Information request, the firm said: "We regularly ask for the views of the public, but are not required to provide the details of individual rider incidents."

It added: "There is an expectation that all of the work on our behalf meets the quality and safety standards that we expect. There are no issues in our delivery network. We are committed to working collaboratively with all our customers and the police, ensuring everyone can fulfil their commitment to work safely and securely."

The incident in the Netherlands was not confirmed to the Guardian earlier this week. The police have been contacted about the report.

Meanwhile, four riders and three companies they work for have reported serious injuries. Three of them were in South Australia. All of them complained of being docked pay and bonuses. One was a South Australian woman; the other is a Dutch woman living in Britain, according to reports. One rider told the Guardian he was going for pay as part of a work experience project in Australia. He was arrested last week on charges relating to a crash, according to reports. He denies the claim.

Deliveroo has been approached for comment.

A spokeswoman for the London Fire Brigade said: "We can confirm that this incident took place outside Dalston, London.

"Deliveroo is working with the police and police have been dealing with the drivers.

"Local fire services attended the following address: 36a Kingsland Road. We are not taking any further action as the enquiry is ongoing."

We're in contact with Deliveroo on this. Our safety policy requires riders to remain on bikes, unless specifically asked to switch vehicles.

A safety update is expected on the company's website, and we will update with any additional information.
