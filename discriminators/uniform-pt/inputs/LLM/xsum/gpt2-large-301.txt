", according to Shelter House executive director David Brown.

But it didn't last.

Since March, Shelter House has run out of money. It will be forced to close at the end of the month.

"It's not just a financial issue for Shelter House. It's a matter of people caring for their neighbours, of keeping our community safe," Mr Brown said.

Mr Brown said he was left alone at his former high school with the man, whose name was not released.

"This wasn't a random person who was sitting in his backyard looking at the trees and the flowers and the kids playing games. This was a man who had seen nothing but pain," he said.

When a friend of the man offered to help, the man's wife, who wasn't in favour, confronted him.

"She was really angry, so I was a little scared," he said.

"But it worked out just fine. That was how I met my family."

Mr Brown said the relationship changed after the man agreed to attend counselling.

However, Shelter House's funding was not renewed with the government. The organization's fundraising and outreach is expected to survive.

The government recently approved an additional $500,000 grant for Shelter House, the organization said.

Shelter House is one of only two shelters in the region that will be forced to close. The other is Ottawa's City Mission, which is running out of funding. Shelter House has not asked for funding or assistance during its transition period.

The organization has to operate under the same standards as other city shelters except where those rules have to be met, Mr. Brown said. The city's rules limit its activities to activities that directly benefit the shelter or homeless family.

Shelter House staff are unable to attend shelters that allow clients to use the building.

Shelter House's current staff includes a family support worker, social workers, and outreach workers who provide counselling. They need about $450,000 to stay open for one year. The organization is only at capacity, Mr. Brown said.

"They're asking people with very deep pockets to drop in and help us," he said. "But not us."
