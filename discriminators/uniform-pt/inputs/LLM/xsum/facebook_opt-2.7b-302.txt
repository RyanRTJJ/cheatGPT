/14 – Visit England £60.5m – and Visit Northern Ireland £59m.

The Welsh Government had budgeted for an increase of £15m in its bid to the Visit Wales fund, bringing its potential fund of money raised for Wales up to £70m over the five-year period. It had initially hoped to raise £70m.

Prof Pritchard said the Welsh government's bid had "failed"

Prof Pritchard said: "The message from Visit Wales is they have put more resources in it but as an organisation their funding has not kept pace with what is going on in other bodies."

Mr Drakeford said he had been "baffled" by the criticism. The government had been on a "long crusade" to increase funding for tourism, he said.

Prof Pritchard said Visit Wales was also going to spend £10m on research and development and another £1m on marketing, digital and visitor engagement, to maximise spending from the fund.

He said Visit Wales could have been much better at developing a strategy for the fund, but said the organisation had made progress.

The Welsh Conservatives, the assembly's largest party, called for an independent review into Visit Wales.
