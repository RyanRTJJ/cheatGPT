, plus more serious conditions such as meningitis and encephalitis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported that the prevalence of Lyme disease rose by 81% between 2004 and 2016. During this time, a number of diseases spread by ticks, including Lyme disease, were reported throughout the United States and Europe.

The rise in these diseases is attributed to two primary factors: climate change and increasing global contacts. The milder temperatures created by climate change make it possible for ticks to survive in areas where they wouldn't have previously, leading to an increase in their population. Additionally, increasing international contact has lead to imported ticks from parts of the world where Lyme disease is endemic.

In order to reduce the risk of contracting tick-borne illnesses, the CDC recommends that anyone venturing out into areas where ticks might be present should use an insect repellent, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants, and check for ticks after being outside. People can also reduce their risk by avoiding tall grass and leaf litter, keeping lawns mowed, trimming overhanging branches, and removing any leaf litter. Finally, if a person is bitten, the tick should be removed with tweezers as soon as possible by grasping it as close to the personâ€™s skin as possible, and disposing of it in alcohol or soapy water.
