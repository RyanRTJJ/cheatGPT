, an Egyptian court overturned five-year prison sentences handed down in May to the two brothers, who were convicted of financial corruption stemming from their father's rule.

Alaa and Gamal, who are the sons of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, were released after the court ruling, which also affirmed their acquittal on charges of ill-gotten gains. The military-backed government had accused the two of benefitting financially from their father's time in office by misusing public funds. The Mubarak brothers maintained their innocence throughout the proceedings and have consistently denounced their convictions as politically motivated. 

The release of the two brothers comes amidst a difficult context in Egypt, where hundreds have been killed in recent weeks in a wave of political unrest. The Mubarak brothers' release could further inflame the tensions engulfing the nation, as many see them as symbols of an era of autocracy. 

Many Egyptians hope that the release of the two brothers signals a step towards restoring the nation's faith in its judicial system. As the two were also recently acquitted for insider trading that cost the public billions, their release could be seen as a sign of hope. 

Al-Ahram news agency reported that the release of the brothers has been welcomed by some and criticised by others. Critics believe that those guilty of corruption should be held to account, while some welcomed the move as a sign of progress away from the old regime of their father's rule. 

Regardless of the interpretation of the events, the release of Alaa and Gamal Mubarak reflects a new approach to justice amidst a turbulent time in the country. It is yet to be seen whether the release of the brothers signals a step forward
