 as they used a stun gun and a baton on him after he became "intolerant", and he became abusive and aggressive, "shouting abuse at officers", before being put in a cell.

Hunt, described as a "dominant" man with "anger issues", was released the next day. Officers said he had been "given clear instructions not to get involved or be aggressive with officers" and police had been told he was experiencing an "adjustment period". Officers confirmed that Hunt was not held in relation to the death of 19-year-old student Thomas Mair, whose body was found in a wood at Bryn Celli Ddu on 6 February on a field opposite to the Bryn Mawr Arms.

In March 2015, officers received reports of an incident of a man yelling "racism" in the area in the early hours. Officers also attended the scene after they received reports of a woman being chased by three men along the A40. Following a search of the area, police officers found one man aged 23 and arrested them without incident for threatening behaviour.

Further incidents

Officers were called to Uplands police station in Llanelli at 12.50am on 10 March 2015, after a police chase ended with three people, two males aged 42 and 45 and two females, aged 31 and 27, being detained under the Mental Health Act. Police said on arrival, they were confronted by a man who "became belligerent" and "started to act irrationally towards officers" in a vehicle. Two police vehicles arrived to assist police and took the driver to Llanelly, and took the three occupants - two females aged 28 and 31 and a man in his forties - to Newport Hospital. A police statement said "the occupants, who suffered from psychosis and had been the subject of reports of violence from police", were not taken to the Newport Hospital because they were "unco-operative", so were taken to the station pending further psychiatric assessment and being detained in custody.

Sergeant Andy Jones said: "I would like to praise all police who attended." A woman who was held under the Mental Health Act was released unharmed.
