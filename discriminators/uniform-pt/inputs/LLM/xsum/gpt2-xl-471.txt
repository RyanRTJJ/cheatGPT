 Smith has not faced any charges. The alleged fraud in the purchase of the company was described in court papers as the largest corporate fraud in British history.

Prosecutors say the company, which at its peak in 2010 had $3tn in assets spread across assets around the world, was a "ghost company" that had no assets or revenues. But the company was in fact using the fictitious earnings of its parent company as a way of manipulating accounting results and issuing debt with phantom assets, to defraud US and Chinese banks.

The company's parent firm, Arosa, is based at the Ritz Carlton in London and had its main office in Macau. In 2008, it acquired GDF Suez, a major energy company in the UK, for US$15bn, creating a new giant of Asian engineering, construction and financial services in the process.

"Despite Arosa Ltd being a 'fictitious company', Arosa Limited was a real company with significant and growing operations in a very crowded international energy market," said Martin Porter of DLA Piper, a US law firm that took over the case in 2015.

Mr Smith's defence team say prosecutors have not proved in court that GDF Suez breached any laws. GDF Suez's management "has had no involvement in the fraud", the defence team said in a statement, and any "illegal conduct and breaches of law... are attributable to Mr Smith."

"The evidence indicates that the fraudulent activities... originated with Arosa Ltd," said Arosa, the defence side.

GDF Suez declined to comment on Wednesday morning.

Lawyers for Mr Smith had previously said he was the only person at the company responsible for its affairs, and claimed Mr Smith's defence would be "unlikely to succeed".

In 2012, he was paid $800,000 (£490,000) at a time when the company's total value was $3.3bn and his salary that year was worth $2m (£1.5m), the US government said.

In 2010, Mr Smith bought Arosa by taking equity to the tune of $5.4bn. The valuation changed by $2bn in October 2011, it said.
