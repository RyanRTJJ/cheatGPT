iano Fuentes, and a further 41 from a sports marketing office in the southern Spanish port city of Malaga, which housed the team's medical staff.

Fuentes, known by his initials FUE as a renowned fertility specialist in Colombia, was jailed for six years in 2009 on his conviction that he sold blood cells to amateur athletes. But he avoided a conviction by claiming that the blood test was a "discovery" of the wrong ethnicity.

Following the investigation, Fuentes admitted to his doping network, and said that he had lied to other clients to cover up the scheme, in a claim that he now denies. He admitted that he had sold blood cells, but had never supplied a sample for analysis.

Fuentes is banned from the sport for life.

In his statement, Mr Froome said: "It is our mutual aim and our duty to help clean up the sport of cycling."

The move in support of the riders comes just over one month after the British Cycling chief executive Pat McQuaid apologised to the cyclists for the "pain we've caused".

He also praised the Spanish government for making "major progress" on the "burden" of doping.

Mr McQuaid described the Spanish investigation as "an excellent start" and said there had been "a lot of good news lately".
