 Saturday.

Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac has named a strong squad for Saturday's warm-up game against RGC 1404 at Parc Eirias.

Seven out-of-contract players, and two academy players, will be named in the 16 to face the Ospreys on Saturday.

Full-back Liam Williams will captain the Wales Sevens side this Saturday for the first time at a World Rugby Sevens series tournament, while Pivac will also name new Welsh internationals Rhys Webb and Ken Owens in his squad.

Welsh rugby team selected this week 12 Aug WRU National Performance Team: Rob Evans, Aled Davies, Elliot Dee, George North, Ken Owens, Aled Davies, Gareth Anscombe, Rhys Patchell, Kieran Hardy, Jonathan Davies, Ben Carter, Leon Brown, Aaron Shingler, Hadleigh Parkes.

Wales captain Sam Warburton, who has started all six of Wales' tests to date this year, will also play in the game at Parc Eirias.

Scarlets director of rugby Pivac said: "We're delighted to have so many of this year's Welsh internationals coming back for this fixture, in an indication of their commitment to the cause and the season ahead.

"It will also be a great opportunity for some who are still searching for their Wales caps to stake their claim for next season and, in the process, help us to give the squad a bit of momentum as we prepare for a crucial part of our pre-season schedule."

Centre Nicky Smith, who is out of contract with the Pro14 club, will again be unavailable for selection for the first pre-season game.

The fixture against RGC 1404, who beat Scarlets last month in a Challenge Cup play-off, will be the Welsh region's seventh pre-season outing before the start of their Pro14 pre-season campaign in August.
