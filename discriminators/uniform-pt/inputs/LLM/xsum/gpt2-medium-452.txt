 slap in the face to our nations, and to those working at the UN around the world", reported the Telegraph.

He said: "[Trump] wants to dismantle and rebuild the United Nations."

"I think it is absolutely clear our country is not going to withdraw, it is not going to stop."

"I think if that were put in the proper terms, it is a slap in the face."

Environment Secretary Michael Gove said to BBC: "I think, for our whole country, it's a slap in the face for the people around the world who work hard to keep us in the global community.

"But what I hope in the future is that people in the US start to think seriously about what is possible and what the alternative to the Paris Agreement is. We don't have an alternative to that, we have one, although we haven't fully implemented the climate agreement fully yet."

He added: "I think it should be a priority of the next president to try and help to make it a little clearer that what we have, and we think it needs to be one of the first things in this administration to try to make clear to our colleagues around the world, that, yes, America will look at making climate change a priority in our country."

He admitted there was a "growing awareness" that climate change was now a threat to world security, according to Channel 4 News.

Mr Gove added: "But, from a military perspective, we think climate change is a big problem."

Global cooling has been blamed for a sharp decrease in sea ice throughout the northern hemisphere, which, in turn, makes icecaps more vulnerable to sea level rise, according to the Guardian.
