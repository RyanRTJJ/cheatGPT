 commonly known as a whalin, removed from the list of mammals under the Protection of Wild Mammal Parks Regulations.

Fishermen and anglers are concerned about the seal coming into contact with their fish. Anglers have told the Angling Trust that the seal will be "eating their food" and will "eat the same fish, eat their eggs and will eventually come into contact with their nets as well as their lines."

The latest attack on Scotland's protected seal population came after four seals were killed by fishers during a hunt on the River Eden in Perthshire earlier this month.

The killings provoked an outcry and the minister responsible for Scotland, Fergus Ewing, ordered a thorough investigation.

In response to the killings, the Minister for the Environment, John Swinney, announced an emergency review of the Marine (Protected Species Acts). He has referred the matter to the Scottish Fishermen's Federation.

Fiona Nicholson, of the Angling Trust, said: "The kill of seals in the River Eden is very concerning. Not only is this an attack on Scotland's seal population which can only be described, in the words of some, as a 'herd', but it has also raised a range of complex legal and ethical issues all relevant to Scotland's fishing heritage."

But David Wilson, general secretary of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said it was "not particularly unusual" to hunt seals â€“ especially when there was an unusually small harvest.

It was just the latest of a succession of "troubles" faced by the fishing industry in Scotland over what it called unfair or excessive takeings.

In 1995 and 1999 WWF-Scotland and the Scottish Fishermen's Federation successfully forced fish stocks to be artificially increased by the Government, so the fishing industry could catch more fish without damaging Scottish fisheries.

In 1996 over a million salmon in Scotland were caught without harming the environment in a campaign led by WWF-Scotland.

At the time WWF-Scotland, the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency were able to persuade The Queen to sign a charter allowing WWF-Scotland and the Federation to sue the Scottish government if quotas were not enforced, the industry was damaged and fishing was not safe
