off mark. Batting on the slower surface, they reached 207-4 in their first innings. After a couple of hours' rest, they were already ahead on day four.

Shaun Marsh (70) and Nick Compton (59) will have a better chance of taking part in the final innings of the week than their opening batsmen. The ball swung more than the ball came in for the England batsmen. Despite getting a good start in the first essay, David Gower was eventually dismissed for nine but by then Worcestershire had amassed 469 in their first essay.

A century of first-class centuries have been scored on the same patch of track. The only other ground capable of producing an all-century day at Lord's is the MCC's Trent Bridge ground. And there have been more in each innings, with the average hitting 90.

It was also the most runs scored by the same century of batsmen at Lord's: Peter May and Viv Richards, who made 106 and 126 respectively, didn't post such numbers.

In the first innings alone, Worcestershire's first-wicket stand of 163 was the third-highest in Test cricket after the landmark stands made by Ian Botham (238 against South Africa at Lords in 1982), and Bill Lawry (165 against South Africa at Lords in 1969). They also set a new County Championship record for the highest first-wicket partnership.

The English weather might have done the trick as well: the weather forecast for tomorrow is sunny to start and then clouds, light rain and breezy conditions are expected by lunch.

For now, though, there are plenty of wickets to go round.
