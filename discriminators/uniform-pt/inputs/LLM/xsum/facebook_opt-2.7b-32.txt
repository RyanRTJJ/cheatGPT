The commercial and strategic management of heritage would be handled by a new authority called Historic Wales, under a review which could cost tens of millions of pounds.

The bodies overseeing commercial and strategic management of heritage already work together under NMW, which is funded by the National Lottery.

This will change under plans to be published on Tuesday, which would mean commercial activities could be merged with heritage management - perhaps under the Historic Wales umbrella.

The changes would be expected to cost tens of millions of pounds in the first year, as it would take the necessary time to train staff, a spokesman for NMW said.

He said: "We will work closely with Historic Wales stakeholders over recent months to consider a range of options for the management of heritage, looking to merge commercial activity with heritage management, while still ensuring the commercial activities are fully commercially compatible with heritage."

He said that this could involve putting the commercial side under Historic Wales as an umbrella body, allowing it to spend public money in a "cost-effective way".

"The cost of operating such a new body could be significant in the short- to medium-term," he said.

NMW confirmed that planning permission for the proposed review had already been granted, but the Welsh government said it would "be taking time to consider the recommendations carefully".

"We will work closely with Historic Wales stakeholders over recent months to consider a range of options for the management of heritage, looking to merge commercial activity with heritage management... while still ensuring the commercial activities are fully commercially compatible with heritage," the Welsh government said in a statement.

NMW said that any changes would take place alongside the restructuring of historic England, with plans to launch
