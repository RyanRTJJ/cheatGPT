 a day are being reported, up from four a day a year ago, according to the report.

The rise has been “unprecedented,” according to Dr David Lewis, director of the Centre for Security Studies at the University of Stirling. “I think what we are looking at is a drone revolution, almost like the start of the industrial revolution, where we are going from having devices to a new range of devices,” he told the Sunday Times.

Dr Lewis, who has written a study for the Royal United Services Institute, which will be published next month, described one incident in which a drone forced a pilot to abort his landing on the wing of an aeroplane.

A total number of offences committed by drones in the past year was 1,715, but these were not included in the annual figures because they were “insignificant”, the Home Office said.

The number of offences is likely to rise, as the number of people using drones is expected to treble during the next four years. There are an estimated 20 million flying cameras in the UK today, with the number expected to increase to 40 million in four years’ time.

At the government’s National Citizen Service training centre in Camberley, Surrey, it’s not the first time they’ve been confronted by them. “I think it’s the easiest thing to take people’s eye off the ball,” said Richard Wright, who runs the course. “You get a young person, or kids coming at you with them, and you can’t see anything.”

Drone sightings have been on the rise since March last year when Theresa May urged the public to “be alert” to the threat and asked the police and other authorities to work closely with the emergency services to tackle the problem.

Since then, incidents have increased and the Royal Air Force launched a public awareness campaign aimed at “raising the alarm” about the hazards posed by drones during a flight or “nearby” to an airport.
