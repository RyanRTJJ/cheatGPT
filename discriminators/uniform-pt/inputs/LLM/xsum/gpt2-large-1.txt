Google Play Music and Apple Music both offer ad-free listening on Android mobile phones, but the music offering from Google Play Music is one of the most popular and features only 500k songs, as opposed to Apple Music's 621,000.

Other features of Google Play Music include free unlimited streaming of 30 million songs from the internet, and unlimited downloads of 10 million songs from Google Play. It also features a 'Genre Search'.
