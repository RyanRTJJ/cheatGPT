In February 2004 it was announced that Mr Kennedy had died following a long battle with cancer. The 52-year-old was diagnosed with melanoma in 2011. The causes of death – cancerous growth of his brain – were ruled a suicide. He had just finished his 50th day as prime minister, the longest being George G Bush in 2004. He had served as defence secretary under Tony Blair during two previous world wars.


Mr Kennedy's family told the Guardian after learning of his death they planned a private memorial service which was due to be held on the second Saturday in May. It had been planned for more than a year, they said, but the family thought now would be an appropriate time.


Ms Johnson, with husband William, had been studying law at Edinburgh University before becoming a nurse. In 2011 she moved to Australia and returned to Britain to establish her own law practice. On her return she became a mother of five. Her death will be deeply sad for her and for us all.


As always in the days after death of a prime minister he is not treated with the same dignity as before. After decades in Westminster there will surely be a great public outpouring of grief, particularly if he were to pass away. It would, however, be an outrage if any politician ever lost his or her job at the expense of the British people. I would hope he would rise to the occasion.


We should also remember for the sake of truth, justice and balance that no politician has any more right to rule, rule with justice, rule with equality. The British people hold their leaders to a higher standard than anyone else. My great-grandfather in Scotland who became prime minister on 30 January 1857 – although he was a Catholic and Presbyterian minister – ruled as a Catholic and Presbyterian minister
