 necessary land and land use permission" for the two facilities.

"Since the council came into office we have seen £25m of capital investment in our town centre. We have also committed nearly £250m of public funding and are making new transport improvements to increase capacity on our rail network."

Mr Brown said the money to build Stourbridge station, which was built in part with private finance, had been agreed with a coalition partner.

He said: "I have no doubt that our town centre will be transformed because of this new partnership, the work in and around Stourbridge station, our new cycleways and the thousands of homes that will be built."

The Birmingham Central MP John Baron said: "The announcement by the mayor of Birmingham is welcome and a great sign of the growing confidence in the city's future.

"It will create thousands of jobs and help reduce the cost of living for residents, which is particularly welcomed as the mayor comes up against a major budget crisis."

The Stourbridge upgrade involves reopening the rail viaduct linking Stourbridge with the city centre that was closed after a severe flooding in 2014.

The northbound side of the viaduct is used by buses that bring pedestrians and cyclists into the city.

Other details including a £300m Crossrail project to upgrade the southbound line at Station Road that will increase passenger capacity in the station itself, a £750m CityLink project linking the city centre with Birmingham's Royal Infirmary, and the completion of the city centre ring road.

In addition to the £25m capital funding announced, Birmingham Infrastructure Trust will get about £8m and Birmingham City Council about £10m.

The mayor will also seek the endorsement of City Hall's economic development committee and local government leaders for two new parks the next day.
