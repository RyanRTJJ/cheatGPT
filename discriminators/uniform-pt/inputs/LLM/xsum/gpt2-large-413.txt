Mr Farrell had sought a summary judgment in favour of the government which is claiming that Mr Bailey had illegally used his position as an elected politician from the constituency of Coleraine to solicit the €20,000 loan from Mr Kenny's friend. He is an ex-Labour councillor and once ran a newspaper business.

Mr Bailey says he did not solicit for the loan, but was made aware of it by people seeking answers about the loan from the former minister prior to it being entered into in 2001. Mr Kenny's spokesman insisted the money was given to Mr Duffy to complete work on a €100,000 road building project.

"This was not a direct financial arrangement with Mr Duffy," a spokesman said.

But Mr Farrell claimed he had been made aware of the loan when the minister first applied for it as a "solicited grant" for business development projects for the Coleraine region.

The case is not legally binding on national law, but is referred to the European Court of Human Rights. Its judgment in Dublin on Tuesday was delivered by Mr Justice Brian McGovern who was also the president of the European Court of Human Rights.

In his judgment, Mr McGovern cited a number of recent opinions expressed in court by judges in France, England, the USA and Luxembourg, all of whom have said that it is lawful to solicit a loan from a state official for personal gain.

The European Court of Human Rights should settle this issue as the EU's own judges have held that people can in some circumstances lend money from public officials in order to finance private benefit. It could also make Ireland's rules binding on other member states as an international law convention.

The Irish Times spoke exclusively to Mr Farrell over the phone on Tuesday morning when the European Court gave the judgment in full in Dublin. He denied any wrongdoing and said he has not received any money from Mr Kenny since he became Fine Gael leader in 2010. He said a solicitor, who he would not name, approached him and
