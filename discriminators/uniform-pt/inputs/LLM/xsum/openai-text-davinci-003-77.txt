 its impact and potential regulations to help protect the public. The inquiry will also look into the governance and regulation of the tech companies that generate and propagate news.

The committee will assess whether existing laws and regulatory frameworks are fit for purpose and consider the role of the state in monitoring and intervening. It will investigate how false or misleading material is spread on the internet, suggesting that tech companies could be required to introduce tougher standards for verifying the sources of information on their platforms.

The inquiry will also look into whether there should be more transparency about who is paying for political advertising, and what personal information is collected about people who view it. It will consider the impact of political campaigning which takes place online and how voters can be better informed of the sources of news and how to identify factual from false or misleading material.

The inquiry reflects public concern that tech companies are not doing enough to prevent the spread of fake news, and that they have unchecked power to shape our information ecosystem. It is hoped that the committeeâ€™s recommendations will lead to effective measures to ensure that online platforms act responsibly and enable citizens to make informed decisions in matters of politics and media.
