pson, NASUWT Northern Ireland official, said:

"The action planned for 30 November is the culmination of months of militant industrial action taken by our members in Belfast and Newtownabbey. We understand that no one takes industrial action lightly, so we have delayed issuing notices until the last possible moment. The consequence of implementing austerity policies, squeezing public budgets to increase profits, has been a growing crisis in education. Enough is enough.‚Äù

He added that education staff faces cutbacks, unnecessary workloads and stagnating wages, while their employers have done nothing to alleviate the situation. "This action has been forced on our members who are simply trying to get a fair pay deal and better working conditions."
