While other members of Congress and public officials are not paying attention, Mr. Trump is. In fact, he is not even mentioning the issue, instead focusing on the election and other topics.

That was the message at the annual meeting of the NRA convention here on Saturday, hosted by NRA President Wayne LaPierre.
