The D.C. police officers who shot and killed an unarmed black man in the District of Columbia in 2014 faced trial on manslaughter and other charges Friday but were acquitted of lesser crimes by an all-white jury.

The jury found the officers, Eutawville police Chief Richard Combs and officer William Porter, not guilty on all counts: involuntary manslaughter, assault and using physical force against a person under the influence, even though Porter told prosecutors that he felt he needed to use deadly force.

The jurors spent about 90 minutes deliberating, deliberating, deliberating, and then deliberating some more, and the case ended in the mistrial of Porter and of Combs.

The trial was not a mistrial because the other charges against them — using unreasonable force and recklessly firing a gun — remained. But a mistrial would be unusual in the District. In the case of police shootings, the prosecution almost always loses. In the case of a manslaughter charge, there is no minimum or maximum sentence.

Prosecutors said that an argument over a citation had broken out between Porter and Bailey and that the shooting was wrong.

“This should send a message. This can’t happen to anyone... if you shoot an unarmed man with your Taser. Don’t lie. Give the truth,” District Attorney Donald E. Clark (D) told reporters. He said he was disappointed with the verdict.

Bailey, 39, was walking in the rain on East Capitol Street in Southeast Washington, on July 31, 2014, when he was stopped by Porter and an Eutawville police officer, identified in court documents as Combs, in a car, Combs’s attorney, Donald Fennell Jr., said.

Fennell had disputed the evidence that Bailey held a knife or that he said anything threatening when officers searched him.

A video showing that search, played in court, depicts Bailey putting his hands up and saying, “Please do not search me,” before an officer says, “Don’t pull that knife on
