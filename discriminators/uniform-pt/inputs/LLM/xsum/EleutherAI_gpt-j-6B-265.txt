 criticized by both the LGBTQ lobby and the British parliament’s home affairs select committee.

Google has long been involved in censorship around the world, with projects such as Project Shield shielding those who express views antithetical to US government policy. While it’s unclear who funds these programs, the Internet company’s own history shows it is hardly averse to political interference.

The Kiddle.co.uk project – which is part of the British Library – was launched in 2007 with a series of “naughty” books. Later, in 2010, it featured a book on the “secret” lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender culture and a book about the gay dating app Grindr.

Kiddle said the books have been downloaded 3.2 million times and it has also received a record number of complaints.

In a statement given to RT, the library’s chief executive Simon Heffer said the site “has worked brilliantly in its first few years” and it believes that being in the public domain means it has a duty to provide a broad range of information.

“At Kiddle, we have never hidden the fact that it is funded by Google. We are not allowed to say that but it gives us the ability to produce more of the sort of material you can find on Wikipedia – factual, reliable and diverse,” Heffer said.

He confirmed that there have been objections, but they have been about the project’s remit. “There would still be people who are unhappy that Kiddle exists as a free resource that many schools and free libraries use,” he said.

“If you are opposed to Kiddle you are opposed to the teaching of literature and the learning of language as well as knowledge.”

He said he is confident that the free license to quote from copyrighted material is strong enough, adding that Kiddle has not been censored.

The home affairs committee said in a report earlier that Kiddle and similar sites present a “disturbing picture” of modern Britain. It cited the site’s apparent opposition to same-sex marriage and its attempt to “suppress content on gay and sexual relationships.�
