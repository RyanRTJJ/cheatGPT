 paint the brown fa√ßade of a dilapidated house.

"How do we stop them?" Ballas asked.

"We're going to do some work that will show them that we won't tolerate harassment or destruction of private property without reprisal," a company representative told him.

Ballas said he was concerned about his own home being demolished, then asked if it would be OK if he went to the police.

"We're not a crime reporting agency, we're a demolition and restoration firm," was all he wanted to say.

Staff at the company assured him there was no reason to fear that any law would stop them.

"We get a little overworked sometimes," said Ballas. "I do feel that they must be afraid that they're going to end up with no job or that they're going to become bankrupt."

He found his wife had painted the house's peeling siding red.

"We've had trouble with neighbors, they said she shouldn't even have done that," Ballas told CBC News. "Maybe we had a misunderstanding about what the company was going to do but I'll go ahead and give them the red-siding."

"A week later one of the neighbors came to our back door," recalls Ballas. "We knew who she was after I called her and asked her to come inside. She told us she didn't have enough of the paint because she thought it was wrong to put it on the house because it was coming off our back yard, and because she said they wouldn't pay for a new paint job."

Ballas says he called police after receiving a phone call from his wife. No one is claiming responsibility for the act but the company continues to receive complaints from neighbors.

A spokesperson for Daniel's Demolitions would not answer any questions asked about the case.

"Any statements or remarks regarding any issue have been issued with the utmost respect and professionalism," said the rep.
