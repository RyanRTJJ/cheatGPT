 within years of having a child, the charity says. "It is a growing problem and the charity's support will help tackle the problems at a crucial time to help others who need support," the charity says.

Dr Sarah Walker, a consultant psychiatrist at King's College London who specialises in treating obesity and conditions such as OCD and OCDC Disorders, said the research on the mental health of children was encouraging, but the evidence wasn't yet strong enough to support the concept of a link between eating disorders and childhood obesity risk.

"It seems it is more likely that these parents were not aware that their child had a problem until they saw the signs," she said.

Walker added: "We're not suggesting a connection between childhood obesity and eating disorders, but this could indicate that it is possible to improve the quality of childcare in children with OCD.

"It is also more common for kids who are overweight to suffer from behavioral problems, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which may further increase childhood eating disorders diagnosis, which may have a negative impact on cognitive problems after childhood. So there are good reasons to explore this. A lot needs to be done to ensure that this link isn't misapplied, and parents need to be given guidance who can help people overcome childhood eating disorders."

An estimated 4 million adults are obese and about one in five live in poverty as a result of family income issues, according to the charity Mind.

Walker said, based on recent research, obesity "is a much more common cause" for eating disorders in children, with about one in five children suffering from an eating disorder by the age of 10 compared to one in 15 adults. This, Walker added, is not necessarily surprising given the high cost and stigma attached to obese children as well as the importance of early discipline, such as having a physical activity plan, which does not happen easily, and also having support groups
