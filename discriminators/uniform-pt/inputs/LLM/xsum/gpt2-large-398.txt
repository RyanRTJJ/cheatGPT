Cheryl Halsey, Tata Steel regional chief executive, said: "We expect that in the coming months, and particularly as we move onto an important phase of the business in 2018, we will need to take the necessary decisions to bring down our workforce, including reductions to our workforce in North Lincoln Road."

In 2014 the business told of plans to close almost 3,300 jobs at the site and lay off 3,600. The move came after Tata's UK parent, Tata Sons, said in late 2014 it was selling an additional 40% stake it owns in the business.

Tata Steel has said the North Lincoln Road site will remain open as its operations at the Southport site "will continue under the new management".

A spokesperson said: "In the majority of cases, the workforce and operating infrastructure for UK operations in the UK remains unaffected by changes to the Tata Steel Group. Over the period and beyond, all Tata Steel Group UK operations including engineering, research and development, manufacturing, sales and trade will operate under the same management team as we are currently employing while our global operations continue under the same governance model."
