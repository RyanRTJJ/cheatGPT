 Kenyan aircraft, which killed and wounded civilians in August, are part of a wider UN-backed campaign to topple the government of a government accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court. Somalia's civil war, sparked in 2003 when anti-US militia fighters launched an insurgency against the government of Siad Barre, was the worst since independence nearly half a century ago. Human rights groups say both sides could be behind the attacks. Kenya says in the past it has supported peace efforts led by a pro-Ugandan government in Washington but has rejected calls from human rights groups for intervention. The US State Department accused Kenyan and UN troops of carrying out several attacks. The UN Security Council has been debating whether to impose new sanctions on both sides. A United Nations peacekeeping force deployed to Somalia has been criticised by the UN for poor performance as human rights activists seek to bring it into line with international law. Kenyan security forces fired artillery shells and mortar shells into the outskirts of the east Ethiopian village of Kairi, the country's worst urban disaster in ages after nearly 2,000 people died in violence and looting by al-Shabab between 2003 and 2014. Al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for nearly a third of the more than 7,600 attacks that have killed about 6,000 people since 2006. The aid agency Oxfam, which works with aid agencies to bring a fair share of aid to the impoverished West African country, said the attacks were a sign of the worsening humanitarian situation.

The spokesman for the Somali Defence Force, Colonel Omar Abdelbarman Mohamed, said Kenyan forces had been involved in three attacks but would be forced to take further action only if they were seen to be continuing. But Kenyan officials say Kenya is only providing defensive support for forces and that no Kenyan military personnel were involved in the airstrikes against al-Shabab - a claim the government has consistently denied.
