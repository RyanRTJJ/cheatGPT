 with only 24 overs to play.

After a quiet start after the change order, the visitors then moved into a commanding position with 17 overs to spare, hitting six fours and making a flurry of fours. Worcestershire were then comfortably ahead, but a final spell in which Worcestershire and England all appeared to be in similar positions meant the visitors had to try again. It was the result that sent them home, but it was not the occasion they set out to enjoy.

Not only did they miss five wickets on day two, the defeat did not improve Worcestershire's plight any. They were left with another massive batting deficit against Australia - the largest they had ever faced - but a few more wickets and progress should have been their objective.

Worcestershire have had a superb season this year. And while they have qualified for the final of the County Championship for the fourth season running, they must now try to repeat their success in the Championship Trophy. A result could see them reach the knock-out stages with a win-plus-draw tie.
