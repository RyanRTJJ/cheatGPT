She got a telephone call from her friend, a woman she had not seen for 10 years.

She did not recognize the voice of the woman, who started telling her about the body they found at the bottom of a river 30 miles away.

The woman said the woman was dead, but she wanted to give her friend some last words to tell relatives. Zlatic went at once to the river.

"I think it's her. This body is as white as a sheet," Zlatic told her friend on the phone.

Her friend told her to not touch the body, and not to talk. The body was in a shallow grave, and was in a black suit but Zlatic heard two words that the woman would not have known.

"You know what was written in the back of that person''s suit?" the other woman asked, Zlatic recalled.

"Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant?"

"You're not going to believe this. I was in shock. I just had coffee. Oh, we were happy. You got that?" said the woman on the phone, who did not say her name.

What happened in those moments of that phone call that led to the death of her young daughter is now in a trial in Australia.

On Tuesday, the jury began its deliberations. Zlatic sat in a waiting room and saw her daughter's picture on a screen. The picture was at the trial and was shown to the trial each day, the only picture of her daughter.
