 the job," said Klinsmann, who admitted he was surprised the US did not announce his exit. "He's earned his place, he's got talent, and this team is good enough to play at the highest level of the world. He's the right man for the job in a year when maybe we weren't ready to win." Klinsmann was widely seen as being in competition with Landon Donovan as a replacement for the World Cup coach but the latter, who would have become president of the US national team, decided not to return. Donovan, with Brazil failing to progress from their group, has announced his retirement later this week and has reportedly agreed to join Russia in their upcoming Asian Cup qualifiers against South Korea and New Zealand. Former Sunderland and Sunderland midfielder Donovan, 36, was part of the Sunderland side that won seven Premier League titles between 1977 and 1981 that included five FA Cups and 16 League Cups and said the loss of Klinsmann as team coach had severely damaged him physically but also mentally. "It definitely took the wind out of our sails," Donovan told The Guardian. "I knew we were a great manager in the last few years but the coaching change took him off the field and it changed the playing field quite a bit. We started the year with a lot to play for but now we're stuck. "For the coach I think he's probably the best fit that we've ever had." Donovan's relationship with Klinsmann has improved markedly when joining Germany and he said his playing days with the US will be finished after this World Cup campaign was finished in March. "We talk every day and they come to visit me, to talk about my career and how they feel about their teams," he said. "It's really great. I really have good mutual friends around Germany – the manager and me, my brother Robbie, my wife, my agent – and the things that we're trying to achieve are really good."
