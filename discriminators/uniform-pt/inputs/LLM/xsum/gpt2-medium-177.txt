3 and 42.5 hours during the summer and winter break, respectively, compared to the average of 45.6 hours.

While the EIS study has a relatively small sample size, teacher salaries are higher the hotter the school year has become. A high school teacher's salary was $51,000 last year, which was $15,000 higher than the national average $30,000. A second-grade teacher was paid $50,000 last year, which was $30,000 higher than the national average. A high school teacher at the high school level was reported to earn $50.12 for the summer, an average hourly wage of $25.25.

The EIS found that teachers whose jobs were considered most vulnerable were more likely to work excessive hours during the school year. A teacher with a two-year contract made an average of 58.9 hours during the summer, compared to 60.0 hours during the winter break. A teacher with a four-year contract made an average of 66.9 per day during the summer, compared to 66.2 per day during the winter break. A teacher with a six-year contract made an average of 67.4 per day during the summer, compared to 65.5 per day during the winter break.

The percentage of teachers of color working in a particular part of the classroom was also more likely to work overtime during the school year, according to the EIS findings. Nearly 9 percent of teachers work overtime in all or almost all of classesâ€”making the U.S. the sixth-most-work-freed class in the world.

While it would be unreasonable to expect teachers to earn the same amount of money they were earning last year without working excessive overtime, the EIS report notes that "labor law provides a window for policymakers to intervene to curtail excessive working hours in schools." Those legislators should focus on the "preventive" benefits, including greater use of "flexible working hours" and lower rates of turnover among teachers.
