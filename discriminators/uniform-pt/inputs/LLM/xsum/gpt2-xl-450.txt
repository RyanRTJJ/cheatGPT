 president, the former Scottish Labour chancellor said only three years in university were enough to give students "a well rounded education" but they should not be forced to stay on their parents' records.

Hamilton said: "If we want to encourage and support young people to go into higher education, we need to allow them to focus fully on their studies. We must support our universities, not create a barrier between them and new students and parents seeking a well-rounded education."

The figures will add to concerns over the extent to which the UK is losing its leading edge of world class university research, as its number of research-funded institutions falls to its lowest in 25 years and the quality of the UK's university education suffers. It was in the year in which the government's higher education shake up began. At the time there were concerns that the proposed changes, which aimed at making universities compete internationally for academic quality, could also help to reduce the quality of higher education.

While university headteachers welcomed the move to focus on the quality of higher education, they were less impressed. Prof Graham Murphy, director of colleges at the University of Southampton, said: "Allowing admissions officers more freedom to choose between international students and those eligible under the immigration rules is good news and an important one, but the decision may well come back to haunt these universities with a large pool of international students."

John Rees, vice-chancellor of Birmingham University, said: "This is a welcome development, which shows that this government recognises the need for change in our current system. It is right to provide greater flexibility to institutions, but we must remember that the most important decision rests with the admissions committee, which must focus on the best interests of those it is meant to serve.

"Although this will benefit our international students in their choice of courses, it will not bring back the tens of thousands of UK academic staff who leave the country
