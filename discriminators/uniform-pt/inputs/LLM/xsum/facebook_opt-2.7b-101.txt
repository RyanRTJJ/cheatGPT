 (1 and 30).

Kirsten managed only five more runs during the second innings, with England's second seamer Mark Stoneman taking 4-27.

Catherine Tate was a stand-in presenter during Monday's show, but took over co-hosting duties once her family arrived for the night, returning by phone from her holiday in Portugal.

She said: "It was a bit of a surprise to be the stand-in presenter for an hour, but it was great fun.

"The phone call home was when the show ended and I came off it and found these lovely pictures I had taken, so I can't be too annoyed with the call."

She added: "I was in Portugal when my mum, dad and two friends came over for the final and we went on holiday to Gran Canaria.

"It was a bit of a surprise to be the stand-in presenter during the hour of my show, but it was really fun".

The show was also marked by the return of the infamous "bounce" from Katherine Grainger after she had inadvertently hit a "bouncey" ball at the end of May's episode.

That incident led to a number of viewers boycotting the show, and Tate, who returned to the studio on Tuesday morning alongside the main co-hosts including Kirsten Butcher (who fronted the show on Monday), Matt Richardson (who fronted the show on Monday) and Tim Robinson (who fronted the show on Monday) called the episode the "final episode".

"That bouncey ball is the reason I thought it was the last episode. When we saw the results from the audience and Twitter, it sounded like we had the lowest ratings ever and we were very worried.

"Obviously it was just the final episode, and it's not going to be every time, but to get the bouncey ball back into play certainly helped us.

"With the last bouncey ball going up so many times, it was the perfect moment for it to go up again."
