 today: "We have a first aid point and our own infirmary up at the airfield. "Everyone from the mainland is welcome. They must be staying there, because if they were not, there would be no need to have an infirmary." The Llanbedr airfield is owned by the RAF but only open to use by members of the public. Members of the public have been coming over for years to camp and they have had first aid supplies in the past. It is a very well known airfield and a good facility but we have never really had any problems before. We have even had a police helicopter land on the field at times and the people would be quite shocked to know it happened. "Our first aid gear is used regularly in the summer; we are not over-stocked if at all. "Over the years people come over from the main Llanbedr site, but there is no accommodation there, which is very inconvenient. "It [Llanbedr] is usually a pretty quiet place. There have been occasions when high tides have been very problematic, but they are coming over for years and have access to our services as long as it is open," added Mr Workman. He denied the area was becoming "over-crowded", but said: "In the past we had people coming over from the main camp, but they have no shelter there, but it does become a problem if there is a lot of high tides." A spokesman for Highways England said: "We are aware of the issue of high tides and are working with the Royal Air Force to try to find a solution. "There are currently temporary measures in place but we can not comment any further due to operational reasons."
