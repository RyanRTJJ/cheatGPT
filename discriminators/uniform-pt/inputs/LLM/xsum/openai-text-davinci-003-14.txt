 believed.

More than 5,000 police officers, including special operations teams, took part in the operation. The raids follow a recent string of bombings in Turkey and a failed coup attempt in July.

According to local media, those detained are believed to have links to the so-called Islamic State (IS) group and other militant organisations. They are also believed to be linked to the recent attacks in the country, most recently in Istanbul on New Year's Eve.

The detentions were part of a nationwide manhunt for individuals suspected of plotting militant attacks. Police are looking for anyone connected to the suicide bomber who attacked a nightclub in Istanbul on New Year's Eve, killing 39 people and injuring dozens more.

Turkey has been the target of a number of deadly attacks over the last year, including a bombing in Istanbul's Sultanahmet Square in January last year that killed 10 people, and an attack on a wedding in Gaziantep that killed 54 people.

This latest operation is another sign of the government's efforts to crack down on terror in the country. Turkey has increased its efforts against terrorism in recent months, implementing a state of emergency and taking measures such as detaining more than 1,000 people in the aftermath of the failed July coup attempt.
