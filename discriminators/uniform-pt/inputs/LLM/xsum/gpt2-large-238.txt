 chief constable Tim Brown, who heads police professional standards, said: "The four officers involved in this incident are highly experienced and highly skilled. Their actions were completely proportionate.

"The officers did not intend to injure or harm either of these two male victims, and in some cases the severity of the two injuries made it difficult to assess whether any of the four officers had actually harmed these victims." He added the officers had been relieved of their duties.

The IPCC said it was "very disappointing" the force had not decided to investigate the incident. It noted that the four officers had all been given an apology following the incident and had offered their "sincerest apologies" for not exercising "due caution" in issuing the warnings.

In one incident following the incident, a young white man was filmed on his lap being taken away by officers. The footage showed him being handcuffed in an orange hood, a plastic bag over his head, with his legs handcuffed behind him.

A third incident had to be dismissed after an eyewitness refused to come back to Scotland Yard and instead filmed police arresting a black man.

On the third incident, the IPCC said: "The footage provided to the IPCC is disturbing and difficult to watch. The IPCC will assess whether or not it is consistent with the IPCC's own recommendations regarding police use of Taser guns."

The IPCC said further advice is to be received.

Metropolitan police commissioners were told in secret minutes last fall that there were concerns over the Taser's handling and that it could be "disproportionately" used.

An internal affairs report on the incident concluded that as many as 30 officers may have used Tasers during the incident, with more than one-third of those using the weapons outside of the performance of a direct arrest.

The report – given to commanders not the police commissioner – was leaked to the Guardian in October last year.
