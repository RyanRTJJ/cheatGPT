 title fight

F1's new owners, Liberty Media, say the move will boost the sport and take the pressure off a growing global crisis over F1's finances.

"We are changing that governance model and we are making sure that we have an improved governance structure," said Liberty chief executive Charlie Whiting.

"It's still pretty embryonic - everybody is still trying to get going - but we're trying to make sure we get on with it.

"It's very important that the new owners are supportive of what we've been doing. We are looking to the rest of the Formula One world to take notes in terms of what is being done and how this new model will impact the sport."

F1's economic woes were highlighted by the decision by Lotus owner Bernie Ecclestone to sell the team in December.

Hamilton said he was not optimistic about the prospects for a "fair" process of change.

"We're at the beginning of a process - we're all waiting for someone to step down," declared Hamilton when he won the title at the season-ending Malaysia Grand Prix.

"They were three wonderful drivers that have been around for a long time so there's no hard feelings but the fans deserve a new generation to take over.

"That's what we're after - that's what we need to achieve to continue to create more options for the future of the sport."

He added: "The fans are a huge part of the future that we all want to achieve, and I feel very fortunate to get a chance to do it."

Mercedes team director Toto Wolff welcomed Hamilton's "outstanding leadership" and said it was "really good news" to have one of the sport's leading drivers back.

"I don't think there is a better place on earth to see a Formula One driver at the top of a podium," said Wolff, who added: "I can assure the fans that Lewis is very busy and very very focused."

Hamilton's victory at Sepang on Sunday will cement his status as the sport's most successful driver
