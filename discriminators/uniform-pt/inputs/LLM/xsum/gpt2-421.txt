 Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu also criticised Nato's efforts to crack down on radical Islamist groups that spread drugs and organised a deadly crackdown on the police last year.

Dhghan blamed the United States and Europe for failing to curb the radicalisation of Muslim extremists, as the NATO region is dominated by Islamic fundamentalists and extremists, who would attack European states if they were not to leave, but also praised the alliance's efforts to curb terrorism.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated at least 15,000 Islamic State supporters were killed and many others had their lives in danger in a military offensive that has so far killed over 60,000 people fighting the Syrian government.

Dhghan, who was confirmed as a member of the UN Security Council on Tuesday, said Nato would "not tolerate actions that make any fundamentalism possible". The UN has imposed a series of military and economic sanctions against the group since the Syrian civil war erupted in March.

"NATO and NATO do not allow an individual to be radicalised without at least some form of proof from the United States, European Union or other major organizations," he added. "They are not willing to let a fundamentalist or militant ideology spread if there is no proof. It must be made clear that we stand united to defend the principle of universal self-determination and a state governed by all citizens not just the Muslims as a class."

Dhghan was the first Nato ambassador to Syria and is chief of the joint forces that train Kurdish forces to fight forces loyal to the Kurds in the north of the country.

"It is impossible to say with certainty which IS leadership will be able to continue its operations, or which are ready to go, without first gaining a certain amount of support from international partners, especially the United States," he said. "When the United States is strong enough to provide these partners with the logistical and logistical support they need to fight IS, I believe we can expect them to come together and continue its operation."
