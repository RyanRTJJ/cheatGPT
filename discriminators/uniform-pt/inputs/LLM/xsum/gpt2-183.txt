 appear in court on Wednesday.

The Crown Prosecution Service said it considered the allegations against the two key figures responsible for $75,000 worth of expenses they incurred when their companies collapsed, including expenses that led to an average house selling for $1100 a week.

The charges have now been dropped and a "full investigation" is proceeding, despite a growing public interest, in an effort to find out whether all of the charges against them have been substantiated.

"It's a huge disappointment that what has taken place today has finally been proven to be part of a massive fraud," SFO prosecutor Andrew Gilligan said.

"In fact, at the time of this year's court appearance, the most recent figures from SFO support the view that there were more than 400 allegations of fraud and over four dozen cases where people had been contacted to report fraud.

"We do accept that we have done a poor job of trying to prosecute these men and it is important that they be investigated thoroughly so that we can find and prosecute them."

The investigation has so far yielded no new leads, but it is a start to a process which will involve new members of the public who will now have their names and phone numbers called for the first time since the scheme began.

The SFO's chief executive, Tom Beale, warned that the evidence gathered, which included the alleged false representation of those charged, could not be corroborated by anyone.

"As we said in the beginning, this is a major criminal investigation and we will take evidence to be conclusive so that it can be used for future prosecutions, but we are in no way complacent.

"That means we have a very high standard of evidence and an extremely high priority to make sure the evidence does not mislead on any of the points we have made here," Beale said.

"Clearly, if you get a fair investigation from SFO, you have the evidence to prosecute
