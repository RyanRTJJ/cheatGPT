 recognized government of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. Both airstrikes were reportedly targeted at protesters in the Bani Hamra district of the capital of Sanaa. The Yemeni government has officially declared a three-day mourning period following the attack.

A second airstrike late on Saturday killed an unknown number of people after a missile targeted a vehicle in the area, according to the Syrian Observatory.

A total of 14 people were wounded in the strikes, the Observatory reported. Local hospitals in Sanaa received the bodies.
