7bn, from the Government’s November budget.

The figures for GDP also include a boost to manufacturing, and changes in the cost of construction.

A spokesman for the Treasury said the figures showed the Government was meeting its economic ambitions.

He said: "GDP is still at its highest levels for over a decade and today's figures show that the last Government's budget deficit reduction programme is well on the way to success.

"In addition, it will now contribute £2.5bn towards the cost of the NHS Long Term Plan and has increased the amount that pensioners contribute to their pensions.

"As well as these changes, this year we have also reduced the deficit in real terms by over £12bn since March 2009."

The Office for National Statistics calculated: "The Government will earn more money in this fiscal year because of lower than expected tax revenues and lower spending by the public and private sector.

"Compared to previous budget years, the Government will borrow 3.7% more this year and its budget deficit, excluding the deficit in debt held by the Bank of England, will be nearly 3.3% lower."

The ONS said the extra borrowing of £7bn will come from lower than expected tax receipts, more generous tax credits payments and a higher than expected spend on day-to-day public services.

It came as new figures this week showed the deficit in the Public Sector Revenue Account had narrowed to £24.87bn in April to September, down £7.8 billion from the same period last year.

On Friday the ONS said "the fall, along with a fall in inflation to 0.8% in the last three months of the financial year (March to September 2008-09), brought down the deficit to its lowest level since April-to-September 2006."

In September, the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted a 4.5% deficit for this financial year and 3.7% for the following.

The ONS said that the deficit in March was £20.75bn, up 4.8% from the same month last year.
