It's just been a fantastic day. I'm looking forward to the first two rounds," he said.

Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell shot the first 61 recorded in a US PGA Championship, and went one better with a 62 on the third day at Liberty National in Jersey City.

The world number 15 came close to a 59 at Carnoustie in last year's Open, but this is McDowell's first ever major win.

McDowell, who has already signed a sponsorship deal to wear Nike apparel this year, said: "It's just been a fantastic day. I'm looking forward to the first two rounds.

McDowell's 62 included eight birdies and one bogey, and was broken by fellow Irishman Rory McIlroy (65).

In the morning, McDowell had been nine shy of becoming only the sixth player to have recorded an opening 60 in the tournament's 102-year history.

McDowell said it was "extraordinary" that he had played just seven practice holes, given that the tournament has had one practice day, a 36-hole exhibition played on Monday.
