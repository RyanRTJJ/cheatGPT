 was in the minds of many British voters and, under pressure, the prime minister has dismissed her as lying.

This should be the case. We owe it to ourselves to give her honest answers. She says absolutely nothing. We now believe that the best way to deal with Brexit is to allow a free vote once we have spoken. We do not want the UK to leave the EU.

The result is that the referendum has failed to deliver on what we hoped, we believed and voted for. We are now in a worse place than before. Our jobs are threatened and we are looking for new opportunities for investment that can keep this country's reputation up and support our jobs. Our people know that Britain needs to see us grow. I believe we have to stay where we think we are now to ensure that we make that decision.

The decision of the UK's membership of the EU will mean less, not more, for the UK and the economy in general. It also means fewer job losses for British workers due to Brexit. It will also mean that we face better pay and higher living standards for families and people of good quality - an outcome that was hard to stomach. We have lost the hope of bringing back our country and we will need, if we are going to win a future of Europe and a post-Brexit Britain, to live up to the promises made.
