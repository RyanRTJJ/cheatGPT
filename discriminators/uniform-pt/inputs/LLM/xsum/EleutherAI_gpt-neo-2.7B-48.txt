 the pins were a different ball-striking type this year that are much tougher to get through," he explained. "I'm not worried about it at the moment, but we'll find out in two weeks. I'm going to need to play better tee shots to get better scores."

Knox is the reigning Masters champion, which means he will be playing against two other champions at Augusta this year. On the first day of the year he opened day two, and he had a par on the 1st, before a birdie on the 10th.

Knox said it has been good to play against all the champions with each tournament he's played with them, from Tiger to Adam Scott (twice). It has helped him come to terms with this situation, and he said that being part of Tiger's team this year has been nice for him.

"It makes it more enjoyable, because I've got a lot of respect for him. It would have been pretty hard for me to stand up and be like 'look at the best' or whatever. It helps make me feel a little more in sync with him. I don't know that it feels too different than playing at Augusta."

Knox opened at a tie for 8th a few months ago before finishing tied for 2nd. He said being in the top ten helped him get some confidence this year, but that he hasn't had the chance to enjoy the moment.

When asked about his final round today. "I felt very free today, very easy to be at the top of the leaderboard. The greens were different, not as tough as before, but as we say the greens in Augusta are very tough."

Knox said his focus is on a few tournaments before the Masters, starting with the Senior British Open at Royal Birkdale. He will also be flying back to Florida on Monday. The last time the Masters was played in Florida
