The head of one school said: "One week yesterday, the Head of the Department of Education sent out a press release saying that the Department was going to close schools in Carmarthenshire.

"On the same day, in Powys, the same announcement was made on the BBC's local radio station but on the day itself the news had already been announced on television and on the BBC website.
