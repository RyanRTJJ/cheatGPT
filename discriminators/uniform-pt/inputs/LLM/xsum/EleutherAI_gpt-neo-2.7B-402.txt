 the job at this moment", said coach Bob Bradley.

Klopp has been warned he can "not do his job", with the manager facing criticism for his reluctance to play Fabio Borini, who looks like breaking down due to a lack of match fitness.

England have been made to look the worst team in the competition after they took a 4-2 first-half lead at the World Cup, leading to some angry accusations. "We'll see him there", said the Frenchman.

This was the first loss for England in the finals of any Under-20 World Cup, an ominous turn of events and a blow to face England in tomorrow's final.

Klopp has had his say regarding his team's performance in Russia, admitting he would have had to make a change at some point and will not dwell on any specific individual mistakes.

The former Manchester United goalkeeper played every minute of Liverpool's Premier League 3-1 victory over Bolton on Saturday afternoon and could well be available.

It was their worst ever performance and their worst World Cup performance in any age group. But Southgate, a man who has often had difficulty managing his under-21 England side, should move quickly to change it with only 10 days remaining.

Former Arsenal, Leicester City and Newcastle midfielder, Nampalys Mendy, is set to take on his new club, AS Monaco. However, he couldn't name a World Cup team in which his team played better.

It was a shocking and frustrating tournament for England fans and one that they will now want to forget.

The England football association had called a press conference before the group match in Russia on Saturday evening, in which Southgate will reveal his final 24-man, 23-man and 23-man-plus squad for this tournament.

I said that in my press conference when I said when you are disappointed to lose you have to make a change or a decision, he got a bit angry again about that decision he made.
