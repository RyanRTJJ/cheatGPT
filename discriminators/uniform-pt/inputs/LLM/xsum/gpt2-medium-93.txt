 the existing railway line into Nottingham, with its two trains in and out every 15 minutes in London instead. "The reason why they had it so difficult is they were so worried about traffic," said Neil Morris, the rail group's transport chief. "A new London rail project like these would certainly improve traffic." The original train line between Lincoln and Nottingham ran from Lincoln to Lincoln's South Lincolnshire Park until it was bombed in World War One. Since then, rail links have been built in a number of countries, but in Lincoln it is only a train that runs every 15 minutes and comes from South Lincolnshire Park to Chester. Some 70 per cent of journeys there are faster than in England due to a dedicated bus line and a dedicated freight train. More than 100,000 people take the train a day, and it comes to a stop in the town of Sheffield on the way to Nottingham City. This is where there have been several incidents. A pedestrian died after being hit by three trains in London in July 2016, when the first of the new rail line, known as the Essex to Leeds line, ran into a street. A passenger was sent crashing down the steps of a tram platform in June 2016, when one train reached speeds of up to 105 mph. Police in England have also said that the use of faster trains has led to higher injury and fatalities. The train that struck Keith James, 44, was travelling at 80mph in May 2016 near the junction of Kent Street in Nottingham and Rotherhithe Rd in London when it crashed into a car in the junction. It took three days after the accident for the train to be declared unsafe, but Mr James's wife, Sue, said she believes the engineer is responsible. Her husband was travelling in the southbound carriages. He was the second person hit by this type of train in the UK last year, with 22 people injured. The average speed of any train in the UK is 68mph.
