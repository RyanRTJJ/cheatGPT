" appears to be based on the idea that goods will be treated as imports from abroad and that therefore, those selling goods overseas need to register with HM Revenue and Customs.

The government's idea is that some people are using a loophole in business rules to avoid HMRC collecting the taxes they should be paying and, to deal with this, HMRC has developed a tool called Stream. The idea is that if you do business overseas you should still pay tax to HMRC but you will not be taxed when you return. The hope is that this reduces revenue which could be used to cut taxes here in the UK.

Shops are afraid that once they've registered themselves properly the HMRC would have to carry out a more intrusive audit and be more diligent. They fear it will mean their business will be more scrutinised by HMRC. There is no doubt it is complicated, as the UK needs to make a huge effort – perhaps even more so than in other countries – to get itself ready for all the changes.

The Government’s plans would affect all online, print and mail shops in the UK that were registered to sell goods or services in other countries – even if they are only used to sell clothes, clothes hangers, or other relatively simple items. That means the vast majority of all companies in the UK. And it would require all UK shops to spend about £10,000 each (£20,000 for multi-site ones) and pay about £100 in fees to be registered to sell across the world.

Many shopkeepers have concerns that this proposal, which has echoes of the tax on internet companies, will hit the very small shop-owners hardest, and will hit many of the retailers who sell goods overseas, such as large multinationals, including Amazon.

Some also worry about the implications for individuals who, like me, sell on eBay, via Ebay shop and via Amazon. All three online marketplaces, which are the largest websites of their kind, have been in discussions with the HMRC, but have so far managed to avoid any tax and remain a simple marketplace
