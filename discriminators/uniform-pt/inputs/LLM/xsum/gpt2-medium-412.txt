utoglu permission to stay until the formation of a new administration after the June 7 election.

"I will do my best to support the president as well," Mr Davutoglu said in Davos, adding that he had "no problem" with Mr Erdogan in his role as Prime Minister.

It is not clear just where Mr Erdogan is going. He attended the European Union summit in Germany, had a brief meeting with President Vladimir Putin and has made clear to the European Council that he is unwilling to sit alongside them in meeting leaders.

In his interview with the Financial Times, Mr Davutoglu added that Turkey, as a close ally of the West, was already feeling the effects of global tensions.

As in the Middle East, they are concerned about the fate of Bashar al-Assad of Syria. But they have much in common with Germany's Angela Merkel.

Mr Davutoglu, who was previously prime minister of Turkey, has long been on the German agenda, even as his European counterparts have looked with concern at a widening migrant crisis across the continent. In recent weeks, the crisis has focused mainly on Germany, with the news that Mr Davutoglu had met at least 19 Muslim men in the southern town of Dresden.

This, of course, is a far cry from the open, democratic government that some say Mr Erdogan wants there. Mr Davutoglu said that Mr Erdogan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had reached a "very good understanding" on the refugee issue. Mr Davutoglu also emphasised the importance of the trans-EU pipeline, which would send the more than 1 billion cubic metres of oil per day into eastern Europe by 2020.

"The trans-EU pipeline is necessary to reduce our dependency on Russian gas," Mr Davutoglu said, adding that Turkey would "cooperate with whatever mechanisms are available".

But Mr Davutoglu rejected the idea that he was in any way looking to undermine or undermine the democratically-elected government in Turkey.
