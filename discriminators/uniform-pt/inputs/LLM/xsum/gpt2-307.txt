, is dedicated to the support of those affected by an acute crisis.

And although they have not been treated for post-traumatic stress disorder, many were "very physically and mentally affected within two weeks of coming into the care of a loved one".

"There was an early report in the press about [Abedi] telling his friends to leave the airport," said a post on SaveTheWorld.org which criticised the Home Office.

Abedi was not allowed in the airport because of fears of being charged.

But he reportedly "had other plans" to go to Syria - a possible trip to Turkey.

BBC Panorama spoke to the man who told how he gave his life for SaveTheWorld and how he said he was "very well aware we never will be able to find him, especially because there are hundreds of us, many who are in the United Kingdom, who were killed on 13 June."

His relatives said they received a call from a man who had lived close to Abedi and asked if they would be willing to go to Syria to bring Abedi's body to justice, and he gave them a package of Â£9,000 at a nearby Tesco gift shop.

Abedi, who now lives at Birmingham University in Birmingham, said: "My first thought was it was a terrorist attack. I went to work for SaveTheWorld and I loved it. I did everything to try to help with the pain and to help people who were at risk."

Now he says he has left his family, he will remain in prison and may be transferred to London if convicted.

Abedi told BBC News that he lost his first of three children when his father, Abdul Hamza al-Shami, died in 1999.

Despite that, he says he has come back to the UK with "great hopes" - "you might be a part of my story".

He says he hoped people would say: "I'm coming home. Thank you."
