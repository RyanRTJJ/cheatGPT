 most, including those of happiness and sadness, as well as feeling "numb", "indole", "angry", "excited", "surprised" and "contentment". They also asked people how they would describe their current mood and how they would describe their mood in the future. The responses to the latter test were coded into four categories for each emotion: "high", "medium", "low", and "numb". Findings also revealed that happiness ranked higher than sadness on a 10-point scale, with happiness being most strongly associated with low levels of "numb", and anger and excitement being strongly associated with positive emotions. The research, published in Psychological Science, is the first to objectively determine the importance of different emotions and emotions' contributions to happiness. A study published earlier this year also found happiness can increase in response to the sight of something positive, such as the sun, birds or flowers. The study, which involved 3200 Dutch participants, found happiness can increase by 17 per cent when participants see a flower, with this effect being most dramatic when they see flowers in their natural colour.

But the research also found people's happiness is more easily influenced by what is around them than they first thought. In the first part of the study, the researchers asked half of the volunteers to observe a series of five different scenes - a series of photos taken in a laboratory environment - of people from different backgrounds, including the rich and poor. Researchers then asked the other volunteers what they had seen. The researchers found the rich saw more happiness than the poor and the poor saw more happiness than the rich, but the rich also saw more happiness in the images than the poor. "It is interesting that rich observers, who are closer to the rich, see more happiness in [the pictures] than the poor, who are closer to the poor," said Dr Martin Roemmeel, one of the researchers, in a statement.

"We found that when people are presented with the chance to observe other people, we see them in more positive light than we do when the opportunity is presented directly." The researchers are hoping the findings of the study can improve the design of public spaces, such as parks, to make them more appealing places to be. They suggest creating
