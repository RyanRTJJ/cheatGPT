 Korean descent, was picked up following an immigration raid in January.

Police allege Lim worked for the North Korea-based Missionary Alliance International. Missionary Alliance International, which does not have directly registered offices, is a non-profit organization in Toronto that helps North Korean defectors. It is based in Seoul and has a director in Toronto.

The North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has issued "a strict warning" to members of the religious community, including "persons belonging to religious denominations," the ministry said. "The people are also instructed not to hold special religious ceremonies and gatherings or to have religious meetings," it said.

'They want to be seen as heroes'

Kwang Joon Ha, a professor at Seoul's Kyungnam University, said the threats have led some North Koreans to flee the country rather than risk being accused of disloyalty.

"They feel they won't be able to hide their guilt when they find themselves in this kind of scrutiny," he told CTVNews.ca.

"I don't think they feel good about putting themselves in such trouble."

The government said that in addition to restricting the activities of the church, it was also cracking down on its leaders for allegedly being too close to North Korea's leadership.

"The Ministry of Unification declared an international alert after the detention of a pastor in Pyongyang, on January 27, 2017," it said on its Korean Central News Agency.

"After thorough investigation, it has found that the pastor of the North Korea-based Christian church, who went to the DPRK to work, [is] involved in the work of the North Korean government. He was given four months' jail in March."

Kwang and several other pastors had reportedly run a church in China until it was shuttered there by authorities of that country in the recent past. In the past, some North Koreans had even made pilgrimages to the Mount Kumgang temple in China, according to local sources.

The ministry said it will not take any steps to return the pastor to Canada, but it is looking into the pastor's whereabouts.
