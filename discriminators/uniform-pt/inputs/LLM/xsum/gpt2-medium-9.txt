 each other anymore. We're completely apart and feel bad for each other, but that has to stay the same," he told RIANovosti news agency. "The wedding night we shared was unforgettable, we shared our love, passion and hopes with each other and we couldn't be more happy." The couple's daughter, Marina, also got married as she said a happy bride "would never need another" after their daughter's wedding, Russia's Kommersant daily reported.

Last week, Russian newspaper Kommersant said Russia might lift a ban requiring couples seeking to get divorced to share a bed with each other, citing court documents. As of November 29, Russian law states that married couples cannot share the bed with each other, except in hospitals or if the man receives emergency treatment for cancer or for a patient who is sick or seriously injured, Kommersant reported on October 26. An October 24 ruling by Russia's High Court overturned a similar decree put into place two years previously, Kommersant reported. The ruling in Krasnoyarskyy reported the court decision as a win for the Russian Orthodox Church in May, when a lower court ordered couples who don't marry to share the bed with each other.

"We decided to end the rules, to open a window to the outside world for the couple who chose marriage by mutual agreement," Krasnoyarskyy's head writer Sergei Emanuella told Kommersant at the time, RIA Novosti reported on September 19.

The court ruling lifted a law against marriage between same-sex couples that expired in 2006 and gave married couples more time to prepare for the day a judge gives effect to the new law.
