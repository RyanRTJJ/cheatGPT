 about to go back to a place where it has dominated. And it could offer hope for Renault's engine-making career yet again.

We have long known that Hockenheim is one of the fastest tracks in the world. There have always been great drivers, competitive cars and great racing. But it remains an eventful place for Formula 1; in addition to being the first'real' race of the season, the venue has previously seen many epic battles -- from the 1982 title tussle between Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna, to the 1987 "Ferrari Shootout," in which Michael Schumacher and Alain Prost faced off.

But it will be a change of scenery this weekend that sees this track reach a new level of significance in the fight for the 2011 F1 championship. Having enjoyed a summer that has included a successful test campaign and a win in Bahrain, Ferrari's victory was particularly welcome. It is a place where Renault has strong links, with the factory team using the track twice in 2001 and again in 2005, its only point at the German grand prix in a poor season for the team, with a solitary podium, despite the presence of Jacques Villeneuve.

Hockenheim is also home to some of the most famous racing in motorsport, the 24 Hours of Hockenheim in the past and the German Le Mans Series race over 24 hours, which, since its return in 1990, has been a highlight of the motorsport calendar. And the circuit is also a place where Mercedes dominated, when Hamilton set a winning fastest lap in 2001 and 2002 respectively, while Kimi Raikkonen scored in 2002 and 2003 in what was then team mate Michael Schumacher's final season at Ferrari.

But it is hard to imagine that the venue will be a factor for Renault in 2011, as it was in 2011. The car was very clearly not strong enough there to challenge for victories. Even last year's race -- with the car still well behind the frontrunners -- saw Renault score just two points. It is far too early to suggest that Hockenheim is not a place where Renault is going to have success. But it is certainly a strange place to visit for Renault.
