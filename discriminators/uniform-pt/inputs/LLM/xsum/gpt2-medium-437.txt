Source: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to release employment figures

Earlier this year the Conservatives were accused of being too "naive" to see the employment figure for part-time workers as positive, arguing that most young people had found other jobs.

Ministers claimed this included people making over 55 and younger, who did more self-employment rather than work full-time.

"There's clear evidence that we can create new jobs faster and make sure people are out of work where and when they want to be," Mr Duncan Smith told reporters when he released his quarterly report in March.

"With this in mind, we are committing to create 5m working jobs a year by 2017/18."

A month later, on June 25, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the government's work experience scheme was failing to cut unemployment among "hard-up" workers. It also warned that even a 2.5% fall in working age benefits would not cover the "inequality" caused by "recreational" labour costs.
