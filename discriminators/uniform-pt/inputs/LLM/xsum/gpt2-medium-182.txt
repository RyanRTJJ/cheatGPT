 Andy Pollock, and an international coaching coach, have suggested that the game could replace the old Rugby World Cup.

Although polls have shown that over 90% of rugby fans are keen to see the Rugby World Cup return, former England Under-20s coach Andy Pollock believes the World Cup has reached a tipping point.

His comments come amid speculation that Wales coach Warren Gatland has made contact with his successor as Wales Head Coach to discuss the possibility of a Rugby World Cup return. Pollock is known for his involvement in European Rugby Cups, which have not generated as much buzz on television as the World Cup have but for one thing, his experience makes him qualified to talk up the game during his next stint in Wales.

"The Rugby World Cup has really turned into an epic competition, which people are talking about right now and there's no question about that," Pollock said.

"There were great ideas. It's an incredible tournament and it was a great tournament for the fans in Australia of 20 clubs from across the globe. This has been the greatest competition of the century which has really helped rugby in England.

"This has been a wonderful tournament to watch on television on four nights every week. It's an amazing opportunity to be involved in so much sports stuff at the same time, but we're seeing more and more teams not doing that and there's so many other opportunities at the minute - it's just a matter of time before we don't have a World Cup again anymore."

The Rugby Football Union is facing increased concerns in Europe that TV commercial rights could be sold and sold and sold again to the highest bidder once the Rugby World Cup continues at the Rugby World Cup 2019 in June 2019. The RFU's involvement in the game has been so strong and so successful that it has raised eyebrows over the current television and commercial deals in Europe.

The issue has been put to head coach Warren Gatland, who was not only very involved in the 2013
