for an oil and gas drilling firm in Shetland when the price of oil dropped in 2014. He says job centres and recruitment agencies have told him that employers do not want to hire staff that may jump ship if the price of oil recovers.

Mr McIntyre believes this is unfair and highlights the instability of the industry. "The companies don't want to take on somebody that's potentially going to go back to the oil and gas industry. I can understand why they wouldn't, because it's an unpredictable industry – they don't know if they're going to be hiring people in twelve months time, or if people are going to leave at the drop of a hat," he said.

He added: "It's a hard situation because there's no stability in the industry – you can't rely on the oil and gas industry as a job prospect. It's a bit of a gamble and that's why so many people are avoiding it."

Mr McIntyre has attempted to reskill into another industry, but he is yet to find a job he can stay in. He does not feel the oil industry is an option for him at the moment, and wants to warn other workers about the risks of sole industry dependence. 

"It's important for people to remember that their job in the oil and gas industry is only as secure as the price of oil is. You can't just bank on that being a constant until retirement," he said.
