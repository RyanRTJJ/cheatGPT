 only one drug on the market - a steroid which can take up to a week to work.

The fungi are also becoming more resistant to standard anti-fungals, leaving patients to have to endure increasingly toxic and expensive treatments.

The Aberdeen team are the first to show how scientists have found a way to harness the power of the immune system to create a vaccine for fungal infections.

The university team, who have been working around the clock for the past five years, had found a way to "kick-start" the immune system with a drug called voriconazole, which can be used to help control fungal infections of the eye.

We know that at an early stage of infection the immunological pathways are working and they are being activated in the cornea but the problem is they haven't developed into a long term defence mechanism

Now they have tested the vaccine in a group of mice - the same mice which were injected with the drug earlier to stimulate the immune system.

The vaccine has created a defence mechanism in the eye in just seven days - after three months it appeared to be as effective in protecting against infection as those mice given no drug at all.

The researchers then treated some mice with the vaccine and again with no drugs. The results show that it is much more effective at preventing the infectious fungi reaching the brain and killing them.

Dr Mike Brinkman says the team's findings show that early vaccine treatment can have a long lasting impact.

"Our research suggests that the efficacy of a vaccine developed at a very early phase of infection can be effective in controlling a fungal infection over a long term," he added.

The scientists believe their work which is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine has the potential to transform the fight against systemic fungal infections, including cryptococcosis - an AIDS infection, and candida
