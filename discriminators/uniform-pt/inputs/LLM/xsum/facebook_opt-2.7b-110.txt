 to the country in the last two decades, after being misdiagnosed as suffering from a neurological disease.

Mrs Appleby, 61, discovered the truth when she read an article about a study published in the British Medical Journal in 2009.

The research found that between 1997 and 2000 2,400 Spanish babies were taken to hospital with a disease called spinocerebellar myopathy, when in reality they had a rare genetic defect that causes epilepsy.

The 27-year-old from Barnsley came to North Yorkshire when he was 10, leaving with his mum and father following the divorce of his parents when he was two.

"We weren't the only case in Barnsley."

Alan, who was diagnosed with the condition when he was 19, later spoke out against doctors, claiming they had missed out many other children.

Doctors had treated him for years with multiple sclerosis, a neurological condition which causes muscles to malfunction.

He added: "I am angry for the doctors who didn't
