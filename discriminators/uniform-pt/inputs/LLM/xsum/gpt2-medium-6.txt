Mrs O'Neill said she was told that the line was operating "with minimal delay", which was supported by a statement from RMT general secretary Mick Cash. However, Mrs O'Neill said she did not understand why the operator's timetable had been "removed from its normal timetable" after it failed the train's main stop.

"The operator made various excuses to the police and the railway to prevent the issue from affecting service over the Thameslink lines," said Mr Cash in a statement.

"When I raised these issues with the operator, his response was to try to claim that the issue had been corrected prior to the service being restored while I was not willing to accept that as he had not explained his rationale for these actions, in particular his lack of explanation after I raised the issue.

The passenger should have been able to have a confident view that all Northern Line trains were not affected, as the passenger clearly saw this and complained very vociferously to staff while attending the London Service on the Saturday morning prior to the incident".

Staff at the station were ordered to check the safety of staff on the train and were not aware of the failure until the evening of Tuesday.

The engineer has been released on bail pending further inquiries.

Mrs O'Neill said she was "overjoyed" to hear that there was a firm investigation.
