A spokesperson at the Hong Kong-based phone giant said the Note 7 recall was "consistent with the company's product safety standards."

On Thursday, Samsung also said it would recall some unsold Galaxy Note 7 phones, according to the Associated Press. And a Samsung spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

Samsung is also facing lawsuits from disgruntled Note 7 owners who claim the recall led to the deaths of their children. The South Korean company recalled about 1.5 million Note 7s in late August after a report
