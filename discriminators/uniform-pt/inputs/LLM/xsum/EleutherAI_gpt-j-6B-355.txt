 “overwhelming emphasis” on getting results. A total of 1,000 schools were inspected by him during his 15 month inquiry. As the chief inspector in chief, Sir Michael Wilshaw, was in no doubt what the problems were at many schools and what they needed to do to sort themselves out. He concluded that 1,000 of the schools – 1 in 2 - were seriously weak and needed ‘major intervention’. Most were so bad that they were placed in a new category called ‘special measures.’ This places them on a watch list to force changes.

Sir Michael said: “They were so weak that they were placed in a category for intervention known as special measures against the will of a majority of governors.”

Inspectors found in some cases teachers in primary schools did not know what the school’s curriculum was or even where the school was.

Teachers often told inspectors their school had no timetable. In some cases inspectors were told a school did not teach the national curriculum, which was to be expected given what they had heard about the standards of the profession.

Inspectors found a number of academies did not keep records of how much a teacher was paid. One academy was found not to comply.

The inspectorate investigated seven governors and 10 managers in relation to serious concerns about governance, leadership and management and there were no significant or systemic improvements.

Inspectors found there was not enough training for new leaders of academy trust schools and that senior leaders lacked understanding of the need to raise the status and profile of those schools “in the eyes of their communities.”

Teachers had not been trained for a variety of roles, ranging from management and leadership to finance, administration, safeguarding, and citizenship.

Inspectors found that the lack of management and leadership skills in some schools left managers struggling to cope and lead changes that required new skills.

“Not everything was new or exciting.”

On the positive side, inspectors saw improved leadership teams and governors, improvements in the quality of teaching and school improvement programmes,
