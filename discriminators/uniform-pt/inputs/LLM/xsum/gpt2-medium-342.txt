It's hard to overstate what the Liberal Democrats' own figures, which show total spending as at 2015, has climbed from 7 per cent as a share of GDP to 17 per cent and to 25 per cent since 2010. It is a figure that reflects huge increases in administrative costs, rising fees and the "dramatic rise" in the cost of medication.

This latest Conservative attack comes as new figures released by the National Audit Office underline the real scale of this increase.

In 2015/16 we received 4,071,000 primary care letters, a rise from 2,726,000 in 2011/12 and from 2,935,000 in the previous year.

However it's more clear now than ever that no matter what figure people say to the NHS is not good enough. On any given week more than 200,000 people enter an acute care hospital bed each year. That is a vast increase on the 917,000 who received treatment in 2013/14 and is five times the 7.6 per cent increase in 2012/13 and the 4.1 per cent increase in 2009/10.

The National Audit Office has recently been criticised for a "dramatic increase" in the charges the NHS is paying to treat those who need treatment.

It said there has been "a dramatic rise in primary care numbers in the past six years â€“ with an average of 50 per cent more coming through its first week of treatment from the year 2003-04 to 2014/15".

This has meant that in 2013/14 patients were booked for up to 52 weeks from the start of treatment at four different hospitals. This can take up to 36 hours and is in addition to the 23 weeks which are still registered without treatment in a primary care hospital, the National Audit Office said in its report, the "first of which included a week in which no treatment has taken place."

But the "first week of treatment", to which they refer as the "first week of care", is also a week in which
