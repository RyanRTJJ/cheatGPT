 injustices and abuses her father in order to bring a man of her world, a war veteran, out of retirement. She is joined by fellow rebels who find they also suffer from the same problems. A series of events unfolds which forces the girls to consider their place in society.

It's an interesting premise and one they should take on.

3. The Black Widow

Writer and editor Jane Yolen was in charge of the anthology "The Golden Years of Science Fiction and Fantasy" anthology in 2015. Among the authors we profiled in that work were Toni Morrison and William Gibson, who are said to be friends.

"The Black Widow" describes the story of a man and women that are trapped in a nuclear warzone, living and working on the premises of a science fiction museum. In the final issue, they learn of a group of scientists from the museum who are preparing to launch a rocket that will be launched into space. They are trying to help out the scientists by providing them with the knowledge necessary to launch it in a safe manner with the knowledge of the consequences.

I'd love to see this work and I'm sure the same fate will befall The Golden Years. It's a fun concept that combines elements of sci-fi/fantasy with espionage.

4. The Golden Path by Jonathan Stroud (Beneath Ceaseless Skies Series)

I know there are plenty of excellent fantasy books out there, but this one has an edge. Jonathan Stroud's debut novel was given the inaugural Nebula Award. It involves characters that look completely different from other fantasy authors.

It follows "bounty hunter" Mariko Nakazawa as she finds herself drawn into an unexpected and exciting plot. It's not too long after the beginning of the novel that the book shifts itself into a fantasy book. It's about an "archaeologist" that has the ability to see into a character's past and she's drawn into a conspiracy with her fellow archeologist. It's a story with twists and turns that keep reading.
