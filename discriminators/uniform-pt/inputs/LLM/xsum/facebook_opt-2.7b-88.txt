4C is properly resourced to achieve its strategic aims.

S4C's budget was cut by over £3 million last year and in 2015/16 a £70 million capital expenditure plan was brought forward.

An S4C spokesperson said: "The report from the committee is a comprehensive assessment of S4C and how it can best continue to serve the best interests of the whole of Wales and what the future of the channel should look like.

"It proposes many changes in how S4C provides Wales with an outstanding service, many of which will require further development of the proposed framework agreement.

"Of particular importance to the committee is the protection of the long-term funding and strategic direction of S4C. S4C welcomes this scrutiny and we welcome the opportunity for the committee to have its say on the future."

In recent years, S4C has sought to bring forward more online content, as well as a number of new investment proposals, such as creating an animation studio in Newport.

Committee chairwoman Jane Hutt said: “The committee’s inquiry has examined S4C’s performance and the impact of its investment decisions on all types of content, from live sporting events to children’s programming.

“This inquiry has concluded the channel's budget has been reduced by £3.1m since 2001.

“Its success, however, is due to a variety of factors and should not be taken as a failure in its capacity to deliver content to suit Welsh interests.

“We have also heard that S4C has invested a significant amount in digital innovation and now serves an online audience and, with the development of its own internet service, aims to provide new internet services in Wales.

“Yet the committee has heard that S4C is struggling to deliver services to areas of Wales where internet facilities are inadequate - which highlights the need for longer-term investment.

"Finally, the committee found that Wales' children deserve a better service than what is currently offered, for example more resources to produce high-quality children's shows, online services for Welsh audiences, and better access to programmes aimed at Welsh-medium education.”
