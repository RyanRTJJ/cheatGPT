The main aim of the research is to establish which of the three possible outcomes would be optimal for us at the moment: a transition to democracy (where we can effectively control the system or at least remove its effects), or any reduction of the powers of the state.

We hope this will show what would happen if we did not take action. For now, a new government is in place, led by Mr Abe.

"An election is a crucial election," is Mr Yamanaka's answer to the other two questions of the paper. A "free" democratic system will never go away. He will "start by introducing all three potential outcomes," as he wrote last year.

This has been the aim of austerity-related discussions at the IMF, which included a number of the government's fellow critics, from Mr Abe, Mr Yamanaka, Mr Abe's closest economic adviser, to the foreign minister, Mr Abe. The central government has also been lobbying the IMF in the form of a 'balanced
