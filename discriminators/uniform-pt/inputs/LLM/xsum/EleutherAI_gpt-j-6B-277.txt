degree murder and is set to go trial

Mr Gray, a Baltimore resident, was arrested after a brief struggle with Officer Goodson during which he was dragged outside the van, sustaining multiple skull fractures and brain injuries.

Officer Goodson, also a resident of the city, denied any wrongdoing and is not being charged in a judicial review and is currently on paid administrative leave.

Following the incident, it emerged Mr Gray was suffering from schizophrenia and the injury was being pinned on the officers by his 'guardian angel' - an unlicensed mental-health worker charged with his care.

Three days later, however, a medical examination revealed Mr Gray did in fact suffer a heart attack and die from a medical cause.

Mr Gray's relatives said the city and police officers had tried to cover up the true events of his death in hopes of hiding what they believed to be the truth: that Officer Goodson intentionally caused his death.

Officers on the scene had also tried to shield Officer Goodson by falsely telling his fellow officers that he suffered from epilepsy, according to the lawyers representing Gray's family.

'Officer Goodson drove with reckless disregard to another human being at least in the eye of the law and in the eye of God,' said Gray's lawyer Barry Pollack.

The lawyer also questioned why Officer Goodson was not wearing body cam footage during the incident and said, 'We are now learning that there are multiple instances where there's a cover up going on.'
