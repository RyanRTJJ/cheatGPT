 told journalists they planned to keep walking out until a new agreement was reached.

A statement issued tonight by a spokesperson for the Labour Shadow Transport Secretary John Prescott said:

This is very disappointing news.

As a member of the RMT it is clearly my intention to continue my work on the front line and to press the case for a change to train management.

I'm disappointed by the lack of unity amongst members of the RMT but the overwhelming majority have shown that they will not withdraw their support for this plan.

This must be set right urgently.

Today the Labour Party also welcomed Labour party members and supporters to a day of protest against the Labour party's position on the rail privatisation plan.

The decision to go on strike comes after Jeremy Corbin AM, the Shadow Minister for Transport, said the Labour party had voted against new trains when he was a Backbench MP.

He said this at the launch of the rail manifesto - a document which gives detail of the policy plans of the Labour party to privatise the railway in the next Parliament.

After this vote, Labour backbenchers took their concerns to the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) and the general secretary of the PLP Steve Reed called on his colleagues to “make certain that this is not going ahead”. (The PLP is made up of all MPs and also includes all party councillors and local party members.)

Although the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) rejected a deal that would have led to the end of government plans to close the rail operating trust, it is understood the union leader, Mick Cash, made it clear he was prepared to resume a ‘significant period of industrial action’ if a way forward was not found soon.

Cash had earlier told the Guardian:

This government plan to sell the national rail network is so flawed – it has not even built a train – it has to be stopped.

We will be coming back on strike.
