The Commonwealth Bank had a systemic practice of facilitating criminal conduct through the use of its ATMs across Australia, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) said in a statement on Thursday. "The misconduct covered a large number of criminal offences including money laundering, child sexual abuse images, terrorism financing, drug trafficking, identity fraud and bribery," the AFCA said, adding that a total of 53,700 alleged breaches had been found." Commonwealth Bank is allegedly the largest lender to illegal money transmission providers, the AFCA statement said, and allegations that it was facilitating money laundering and child exploitation were particularly concerning. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), which is currently investigating allegations of misconduct by Royal Commissions, in March said it had referred 22 allegations of a criminal offence to the AFCA for a ruling. ASIC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement that the allegations were among the most serious possible and ASIC was committed to taking action to ensure they were investigated and resolved.
