 were sold during the period. That's an annual increase of 20.1%. For the second consecutive year, home buys moved up by more than 8%: 8,634 homes were sold during the 12 months to 31 December 2012 compared with 7,930 during the same period of 2011. Housing sales are still 7.7% lower than a year ago, however.

The number of residential property transactions in March (as reported by the UK Statistics Authority) was up 4.0% over the previous 12-month period. The overall level of transactions – at £2.66bn – is still 6.7% lower than the peak in January-March 2004; however sales have grown steadily since then as the global recession hit home countries, and buyers scrambled to find the most competitive prices on the open market.

On an annual basis, the UK now accounts for about 20% of global market activity, said RoS chairman and chief executive Michael Matheson. While these figures are slightly ahead of those from the previous 12-month period in 2012, there's been little or no growth in the UK since early 2010.

"What we have seen since 2010 is a big shift within the London market," Matheson said. "Over the past year, over 45,000 more sales of property in London than in the previous 12-month period."

For Scotland, there has been little change in transactions between residential and purchase, meaning some cities – Aberdeen and Edinburgh in particular – saw their home buyer registrations fall. However, the amount of money made by residential buyers is on the rise, and homebuyers in other Scottish cities including Glasgow and Dundee have more interest in buying for investment rather than just the next property.

The increase in sales in Edinburgh to £33m, for example, was a 35% increase on last year. In fact, Edinburgh housebuyers spent more of their money on accommodation during October 2012 than they did when these statistics were first compiled in June 2007, putting them on track to see their annual spending of £22.1m rise in the past 12 months.

There are still 2,823 homes in Edinburgh for sale in the market, a fall of 36%, and just 19 homebuyers
