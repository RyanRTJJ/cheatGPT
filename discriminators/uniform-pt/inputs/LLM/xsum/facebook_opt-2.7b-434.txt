 forced officials to cancel the search, but the pair were later pronounced dead.

The duo were found by emergency workers wearing avalanche equipment - although it hasn't been disclosed whether they were fully dressed - and their bodies were later found in a snow-covered valley.

A search party of 200 firefighters was in operation at the time of the tragedy, with the body of rescue diver Martin Hadden, 54, recovered from the River Calder on Sunday evening.

The names of the missing climbers have not yet been released, along with the name of Hadden.

Police earlier this week urged people to consider their "own personal safety and to travel in groups of no more than eight this season" for the safety of themselves and other visitors.

The search for the climbers came a day after the body of another tourist was found at the base of Denali and just days after two experienced climbers died in an avalanche at the peak.

Climber Joe McPhee, 48, and fellow Australian Ross William Arnold (52) - who were with their son Oliver, 18 - were killed in dramatic circumstances after the avalanche swept them away on Wednesday afternoon.

Their death came just days after a climber found himself in a perilous situation just after 11,000ft high in the Himalayas.

Police have said it is too early to establish a cause for the tragedy, which will be subject to an ongoing investigation.

Meanwhile, a former firefighter has taken his own life on a climbing route in the Sierra Nevada mountains in northern Peru.

The body of 37-year-old Matthew James Gannon from South Yorkshire was discovered at the top of the 5,000m Alpina climbing route after he became separated from his team on their third day of climbing, which began on Saturday.

Gannon's sister, Emma, said in a statement to the Sheffield Telegraph: "It is with great sadness we now have to confirm the loss of Matty.

"We can now confirm Matty took his own life yesterday at the base of the first pass on the Alpina route.

"He was just 37 years of age and leaves behind his beautiful partner Anna, children George, Noah and Daisy and parents, Rob and Sue.
