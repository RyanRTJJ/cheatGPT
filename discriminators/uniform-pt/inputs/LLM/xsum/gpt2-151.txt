 to improve their policies to ensure their patients can access urgent care, according to DHRC chief secretary Frances O'McNicol.

"Doctors should not be forced to cover complex care in NHS practice, they are entitled to care they understand the quality of, and what should be available for, patients who are ill," says O'McNicol.

Clinicians are also advised "not to assume that all conditions – medical conditions and practices – are a cause, as there are no clear, reliable, or effective measures by which patients are able to access care from outside their private specialist hospitals".

For now, doctors must remain in their private practice if they are not actively assisting patients who need it, says DHRC chief secretary Frances O'McNicol. As well, patients should have at least limited exposure to emergency doctors and specialist practice if they choose not to attend the service.

In practice, patients are offered access to specialists who would have to help them cover costs over their lifetime, but the practice is limited. According to Dr O'McNicol, specialist practice will continue to function effectively until the NHS achieves sufficient funding but "such an aim has only become apparent once patients are in the care of an informed doctor", suggesting that "the focus on patient safety should rest on making sure all patients have access to the services they seek, instead of on prescribing them".

Dr O'McNicol is quick to add: "As a patient, it's one thing if you lose your job, or you're treated poorly for any reason at random in your family, or you are treated poorly for certain conditions, you lose a lot of time, but it's much more important if you're the one being treated, and that's the fundamental reason for how we operate in the first place.

"Clinicians should continue to use their professional skills in a professional way, and take care of patients appropriately because, at the moment, with so many people needing treatment, they aren't even aware of that."
