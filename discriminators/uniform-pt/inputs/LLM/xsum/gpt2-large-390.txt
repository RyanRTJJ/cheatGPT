I just want to say that I am going to be voting for Europe, I am going to be voting for Britain and my views will become clear on the basis I am in this House today.

But on the EU, it's not very clear who are the most right wing Tory MPs in the House of Commons, I want to find out who are the most right wing Welsh politicians, I want to talk to them, I want to ask them about this, because on it there's no right or left and in this house there's a majority on either side and I think this is a time in which we need to make decisions that we have to make in the interests of British people rather than those of our constituents.

Glyn Davies was in the Commons for five years after he was elected from the Swansea East constituency, where he has the longest-serving Westminster MP in Wales (David Jones holds the record).
