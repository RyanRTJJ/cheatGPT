-based company was up 21 per cent to £7.6bn compared with a year earlier.

But a report in Friday's industry newspaper, the Yorkshire Post, revealed that it had been told by the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy that it could not guarantee that its profits from Northern Ireland would be retained in the UK for tax purposes.

However Sir Robert, who is also chairman of the business council of the City of London Corporation, said the UK government took the situation "very seriously indeed". He added: "It is important to note that no decisions or recommendations have been made and we are still waiting for replies to our queries."

The UK government is also scrutinising the way it treats its offshore wind farms through its Renewable Obligation. Last year the UK set a target to have 5 per cent of electricity produced from renewables by the end of 2020.

But a report by tax consultants PwC shows that some offshore wind farms are in fact not subject to any VAT and instead must be zero rated in order to comply with the tax regime for oil and gas exploration, extraction and development.

The report, commissioned by the UK Green party, shows that, on paper at least, an offshore wind farm operating in the UK would become liable for paying tax on its profits regardless of whether it is running full time or just part-time.

However, the tax regime used by tax authorities makes it difficult to determine whether the business was profitable. PwC said that in order to understand whether the wind farm would be liable for VAT, HMRC would have to verify that:

• it carried out active operations;

• its costs were being calculated according to the statutory scheme for the tax; and

• it had a profit in sight.

The report concludes: "The tax treatment of offshore wind farms is uncertain and therefore the value of the UK wind industry can not be accurately assessed."
