Lewis Hamilton believes McLaren boss Ron Dennis has "done an outstanding job, I really like him" but that the team is lacking in performance. "It must be frustrating to just focus on our race preparations, to go out there and try and help them and do our job and then they put on a great performance and just dominate the rest of the way, it must be frustrating," said the 22-year-old.

"When we lost a pit stop, it was pretty much a miracle because it's a qualifying pit stop and you know how tricky that is to try and get back out on the track.

"He really has done an outstanding job there. He has built the car up properly, he has looked pretty smart of me on the first half of the year, he's got some really good points in his book for this weekend." Mercedes did come close to matching their win over Ferrari in Mexico last Sunday, and also did impressive work on the brakes, with a second best finish from an outfit that finished 14th in the constructors' championship and 13th in the drivers' championship.

Having managed to pass in Mexico to give the title to the Red Bull - and, by implication, to the team - Mercedes now have a new focus on race preparation and the final days of the season when they need to deliver on performance ahead of the new tyres.

"When you are chasing the title, maybe there's a second focus just getting over the finish line," admitted Nico Rosberg. "We haven't managed to do that this year. We did a great job in Mexico - as well in Australia - last year.

"When the car's running good, but you get a little bit off track, the race cars are quicker and quicker, the tyres are just better
