Officials from Brazil's Health Ministry were summoned to an international summit in Washington last week and told to investigate the contamination. They said at the same meeting a food-poisoning epidemic had been "sporadic" for weeks, and added they would investigate to see if it was related to the problem in the country's slaughterhouses and meat processing plants.

In one of the largest meat recalls in the hemisphere, Brazil said last Tuesday afternoon that it had suspended all imports of US beef and pork, including beef burgers and pork sausages, after tests found a high probability that the meat had not been fit for human consumption. About 50 countries have also banned Brazilian imports.

A ban on Mexican beef in 2003 was also partially lifted when the origin of meat, not the plants that produced the meat, was found to be to blame.
