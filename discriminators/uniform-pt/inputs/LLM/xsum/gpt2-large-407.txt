 1 000 years BC and died of starvation and other causes. He had been bound to a board in what remains to be a very well-preserved grave.

Archaeologist Sarah Jones, an independent scientific advisor to Scotland on the Find Scotland project, said: "The circumstances of his death remain a huge mystery. The bones are extremely well preserved and very well preserved for a period of less than 1,000 years."

The team are also finding that certain parts of the bones of the man are not found in graves or other mounds. They say they cannot say how these parts are missing.

The skeleton was found by Graham Wollin, a carpenter working on a building on the island during a construction project.

This is what Graham said about it:

"I found a huge find of bones, it was quite surprising… It's a really interesting find… I think it's a man from about 100 years ago, he had a big head, shoulders and back, he had long limbs. He was probably a farmer or a farmer's son."

"I dug a little bit deeper into the mound and there was a couple of people living there in the day.

"The skeleton found underneath the first floor has been missing until now so it's incredible that the bones weren't missed. The bones have been discovered on top of one of the walls of a private residence, which we are trying to establish.

"It's a really interesting find. We're trying to get in touch with some archaeologists to know what the context will be for the bones and if I had more bones I would like to be able to talk about it."

The skeleton belongs to a hunter from the area known as Broinigal.

This is where Professor Mark Evans of Orkney University leads a new project called the Broinigal Neolithic Human Bone Project. The Neolithic period is thought to have lasted from about 30,000 BC to around 5,000 BC.
