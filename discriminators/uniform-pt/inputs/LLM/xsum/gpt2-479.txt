The government's new anti-dowry law, adopted in 2015, was meant to protect a law that said women would be given equal right to marry irrespective of nationality or culture. The law was not a legal principle but an effort to curb human rights abuses.

It is unlikely that women will continue to face discrimination at home. The government has said it hopes that the discriminatory legislation will bring a positive change in attitudes towards women as she has struggled to stay in control of her sexuality and was forced to change her gender in 2004.

Women who are accused of dowry harassment will then be forced to have an equal chance of getting married in the country. The government plans to give women, usually younger, equal chance to become married at the age of 20 or 24.

It says there is no need for compulsory schooling or parental permission for husbands.

The government said that by making marriages illegal, it was seeking to get rid of the legal status of polygamy.

"The government believes that a family without a father is not a mother. Marriage should be based on the family's will and not on who will have children," said the Ministry of Home Affairs, which made the move.

The court said that it had been considering the issue for eight months before deciding on the proposal.

"The government does not have legal authority to decide without considering all relevant issues involved. It is simply trying to improve the life of the women and girls residing in India," the court said.

The marriage to be registered is now legal but one woman may seek the other woman's approval before the marriage is started.

The ministry has said that women who are accused of dowry harassment should not be arrested until charges are verified. Thousands of people are arrested every year under the tough anti-dowry law.
