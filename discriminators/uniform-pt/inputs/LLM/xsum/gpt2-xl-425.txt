 in Ayn Sahab province, western Afghanistan, on Friday, the UK military said.

Two British soldiers have been killed in joint US and Afghan force operations in Helmand province since Sunday, a security official told the AP news agency.

The latest casualty report follows another 30 soldiers being wounded in Friday's shooting at Camp Bastion, said a Royal Engineers spokesman. The British have lost 18 soldiers since the start of the year.

The attack came within a week of the deployment of British troops to Helmand to bolster the defence of their capital, Lashkar Gah, from Taliban attacks.

Helmand province, where Sangin sits, was hit by an ambush on Sunday night as Nato security forces prepared to advance on an improvised explosive device site.

In a televised speech on Friday evening, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani rejected the Taliban's demand to hand over their leadership.

But he reiterated his support for the deployment of foreign troops but also reiterated his stance that the government must secure and govern with people, instead of its rivals in the Taliban movement.

The defence ministry has repeatedly called Nato to withdraw troops amid fears of "retaliation" by Taliban-linked groups.

The US has said it will end combat operations in Iraq by June, and British forces are due to withdraw by the end of the year.

In January, the US admitted it had lost two dozen men and said it was planning to cut its war-torn country deployment to fewer than 50,000.

General John Campbell, the commander of Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) that leads the Afghanistan campaign, told the BBC he did not consider Friday "the worst day ever in terms of the number of servicemen and women that we've lost".

"We just cannot lose this many men, women and children under any circumstances," he said.

He added that "we will move on. This is about the next 100 years of our Afghanistan policy and it is about our future."
