Southampton have beaten Tottenham, Liverpool and Arsenal this term, all teams in the top five. Their away record is impressive, sitting above Tottenham at this stage with two wins from two.

"They have shown consistency for sure," Clement said. "They were up and down last year but I think they are a very genuine team now.

"Their away form has been very strong, Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal had been really tough opponents for them and they won both. When they get that type of football, they can cause you problems. It's the second time this season they have beat Arsenal, that's a big compliment to their footballing structure."

Clement praised Tottenham's manager Mauricio Pochettino for his achievements at the club so far.

"He is an extraordinary manager," he said. "He has worked wonders at Espanyol and then Espanyol, Barcelona and then PSG, when he was managing the France national team.

"The talent he has got there is remarkable and I think the players see they are working for something. Not just to try and be somewhere a certain number of times, but to get to the Champions League as something is happening and they know they have a great chance. This will make the players determined, so they're the team who must be respected.

"What happens this year is up to them. They cannot get too high in their heads. We have to look at ourselves and try to get up those gears as well. I do not think we are in a position to challenge for anything so let's just try and secure that top half. It's a work in progress for us."

Clement will not select goalkeeper Alex McCarthy or winger Dusan Tadic.

"McCarthy's not ready," Clement said. "Dusan went off the last game with an injury problem. I don't think he will be involved."
