THE CABINET of public safety ministers yesterday approved the plans to expand the police’s fleet of 40 pedal-assist bikes to 50.

The government approved the expansion of the pedal-assist bikes after the pilot was set up at London’s Southwark police station in December. It had been delayed twice by the police and health chiefs.

The bikes would help prevent more than 1,250 deaths and 7,500 serious injuries each year, the plans say. The bikes will be installed in three areas and will cost about £8 million ($11 million), including funding from the police.

The bike pilot trial is funded by the Home Office and will run for four years. The three areas being considered are in Barking and Dagenham, Newham, and Redbridge.

"The police will provide a service for users of the new bicycles in line with their service. Bike riders will get to and from stations as they do currently," Simon Burns, of Greater London North West and Thames Valley police, said.

Motorists will be given bike helmets, as with the standard pedal-assist model, although the helmet is not mandatory and there is no extra fee for using the bikes.
