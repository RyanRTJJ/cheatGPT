 are also becoming more complex. Some researchers are turning to genetically engineered insects that take on the bug's biology."We are taking an approach to eliminate the pest through evolution," said Dr. Peter Hui, an associate professor in the Department of Entomology at the University of Illinois and the author of the study. "We don't know yet if that's going to work but it's one of several approaches we've tried."The insects are also being sprayed by farmers, with some countries applying more than 8,000 gallons of herbicides, but they don't get the insecticide's toxic impact. Instead, an engineered fly developed in the laboratory appears to have a high tolerance to several of the pesticides. The insect's DNA has been inserted with genes that allow it to quickly evolve into one of the world's most widespread bedbugs, known as the European lacewing.The findings could result in many more kinds of insecticide-resistant bugs, meaning they may be a new way to deal with the pest without risking the emergence of new bugs. The research was published this month in the journal PloS One: An open access journal that allows readers to read it on their computers, tablets, or smart phones with the click of the button."From insects to birds, dogs, cats, rodents, and even people, many ways to eradicate pests are on the drawing board," said Dr. David J. Hwang, the principal investigator of the multi-center research effort. "What is the best method? We still have to find out."The research was undertaken by researchers affiliated with the National Institutes of Health, the University of Illinois and Indiana University, including scientists at Northwestern University. The research did not involve any employees of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, or any university departments or centers. All authors are affiliated with the national institutes of energy in the United States and the National Science Foundation.The field of insects and their genetics is advancing rapidly
