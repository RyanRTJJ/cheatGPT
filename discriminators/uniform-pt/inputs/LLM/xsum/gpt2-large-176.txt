SEs, on average, than in the north and south-east. But they receive lower marks overall. This is likely to be a result of a mix of poorer quality schools and more effective teachers.

The gap has widened between the proportion of poorer pupils in poorer schools overall and in some secondary schools. Of the 829,000 people with GCSE results between 2009 and 2013, an average of more than one in ten obtained a five-good, on-to-satisfactory grade. By comparison, by 2013 only one in three in the north and two in three in south-east achieved this.

These results will be examined in a report for the head of the exam board, John Biggs. He said: "It is clear that the south-east is not delivering as many five-good grades as neighbouring regions, despite improving. But we don't have to wait for the full analysis at the end of next year to know exactly why. To make things worse, this shows that there has been a worrying level of under-coaching of high-achieving pupils in some areas â€“ the number of schools achieving five good GCSE grades has fallen by 40 to 50 per cent in some schools, compared to the whole of the south."

An Ofqual report on the progress of schools in the north-east has shown that over the past two years, the proportion of pupils awarded a five-good GCSE increased by about seven percentage points. But between 2011 and 2013, the figure fell by 19 percentage points to 36.5%, even as the number of schools awarded a five-good grade more than doubled to 161, compared to just 18.

Biggs said: "The south-east needs to double its performance in every subject to ensure that every child has the chance of progressing to the next grade: the government still needs to ensure the school system does not cause a
