 to ensure every hospital and doctor will provide a high-quality NHS, regardless of the volume that patients need.

For example, in the past couple of years, a series of hospital closures has led NHS Ayrshire to suspend operating hours across all Ayrshire hospitals. This is in breach of the Royal Commission on Health and Social Care, which recommends that hospitals provide 24/7 care for all people within their care, including those with complex concerns.

The fact that doctors are increasingly feeling the strain of managing patients' conditions, despite the health service's current financial crisis, is also a national scandal. In 2013, doctors at four of the country's major hospitals, and in all four regional hospitals, told NHS England they had no cash, equipment or resources.

Many hospitals have no money and are forced to put patients in care homes, but they are not making enough money to cover even these costs, according to an analysis by the Nuffield Trust.

And the shortage of trained medical personnel to carry out routine patient care is another serious problem. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently announced that the number of clinical doctors had fallen to 9,000 on 2010-11 figures, only to rise to 11,700 by 2014-15.

NHS England would need to invest £8.5bn on new facilities and pay for nearly 600,000 more doctors if budgets were to rise from £3.2bn this year to the estimated £5.4bn needed to deliver a "comprehensive national health service" - a target seen as vital to ensuring the national body can fund all essential services.

The RCGP calls for a complete rethink of the current system, with the aim of making sure each hospital and GP has the training, staff and equipment it needs to be a national health service.

Its recommendation states: "The Scottish Government must do everything it can to make changes for all hospitals to ensure that as many patients have a good quality of care as possible at their surgery and GP surgeries."

If the government does this, the RCGP wants to see more investment in mental health care, which has been a "hidden disability" in the UK for several decades. For example, since 2013 the Scottish government has pledged a further £1.4
