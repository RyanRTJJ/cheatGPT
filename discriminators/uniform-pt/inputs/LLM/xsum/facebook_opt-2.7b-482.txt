 a media event in New York.

While in New York, at the launch event for its Pixel phones, Google Assistant was unveiled. Google Assistant can be activated by taking a picture of any card in your wallet.

Google Assistant has been built into the Pixel phone and the company said that it will soon be making it available in all Android phones.

"You’ll be able to use Google Assistant across your entire device with any Android phone that has the Google Assistant," Google's Google said at the launch event.

"If you buy a new phone, you can add Assistant without having to unlock your phone or sign into anything."

On the photo capturing front, when the user takes a picture with Pixel phone, Google Assistant starts recording. When the photos are ready, users can access them with Google Photos.

"As you’re taking photos, Google Assistant will start taking notes, organizing them on Google’s Google Drive for you, and suggesting locations across the globe," Google said during its launch events for Pixel phone and Pixelbook.

Google has been building up the user data for more than one year in order to develop the tech.

"When you’re taking a picture or video, Assistant will notice if you’re using your phone, so it’s even more helpful if you put it down," Google said.

Google Assistant will have a smart voice, which means that it will offer more natural sound and will learn from its users.

"If you use Assistant a lot, Assistant will get more and more useful. And even if you don’t use Google Assistant a lot, you still might find it helpful, because you’ll be able to talk with your phone without ever touching your phone," Google had said at the media conference.

The feature will be available on Pixel phones in the US.

Google, last year, acquired the voice technology company Nuance Communications to help it build Assistant. Google Assistant is available now on the Pixel Phones and it is soon to be coming to other Android devices.
