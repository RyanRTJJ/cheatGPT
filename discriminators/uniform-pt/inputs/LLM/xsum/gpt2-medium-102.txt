 damage much further.

It will take more time for the sea ice to return to its normal state, which would affect the amount of fish consumed – and how well fish can be fed to young birds.

What happened next is still controversial, but researchers at Swansea University and the University of Leicester found that fish can actually survive in the absence of sea ice.

But whether sea ice is actually holding back an increasing number of birds is up for debate. On 1 January 2004 a jetliner crashed into a sea ice flake, setting the whole area alight for about 10 minutes.

The area was covered with flames. Some of the plane's engines caught fire, but the whole of the plane, including its engines and tail rotor, survived. The fire was extinguished and there was no sign of any oil slicks.

But another study showed that despite the flaky ground, the oil layer was extremely thin. On the day of the crash, the flight deck was nearly four times thinner than normal, according to researchers who examined the damage.

If there is still oil there, you would need to take that layer into the upper levels of the sea ice to find the oil that's there, the scientists suggest – and it would require several weeks of travelling up there to do it. These currents in the ocean would have to be powerful enough to lift up the oil, said Nick O'Grady, the research professor at Cardiff University's School of Coastal and Polar Biology.

If it had been a real flake, and people did indeed have to make the trip all of the time, it would have caused a lot of damage and a lot of fatalities, he said.

The plane and the sea ice are very different shapes, he said. If you get into one, like flying into a rock formation – and that's what we're doing, and there is a flake below that, there is nothing to actually move it around. What we think is a sea ice flake
