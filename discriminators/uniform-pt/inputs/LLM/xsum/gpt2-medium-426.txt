 that Iran agreed to dismantle the uranium centrifuges and replace the devices with better detectors.

It would take many thousands of international sanctions to break Iran's nuclear programme apart, experts say. "My bet is we are headed for nuclear Armageddon, if not as we have just seen with the last five presidents, then as we have predicted."

Fukuyama said Iran, the world's biggest exporter of crude oil, had not yet proven it can produce enough crude for domestic use to meet its growing domestic needs. He called it "highly unlikely" that the Islamic Republic, which accounts for about 90% of global crude production, could build up enough domestic reserves and use the enriched uranium to make fuel for the "future development," as the negotiators say.

"This is the worst scenario, in my opinion, you could imagine from the regime's point of view," he said. The world would be "trampled" by what he described as an "all-out nuclear war," potentially with the Soviet Union and China if Tehran, whose economy is based principally on oil, were to take control instead of the United States and its allies.

Fukuyama said that, despite the international sanctions against Iran, "nothing is going to happen in the nuclear sphere". He said, however, that a nuclear-armed Iran – backed by the West – would be extremely dangerous for the rest of the world.

"I really think that there could be a future threat from Iran even if they do not act to attack," said Fukuyama, who warned in his remarks before a wide-ranging meeting of world leaders which was closed to the press. The United States had agreed to work with Iraq to prevent the rise of Iranian influence, he said, but Iraq was not doing enough.

"How dangerous will Iraq become in that situation? And what risk will this create for the rest of the world?"
