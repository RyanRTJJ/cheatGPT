 there are now seven confirmed cases of the strain and another four suspected new admissions. The confirmed cases are from five adults under the age of 50, with an investigation under way into further confirmed patients.

The health board said that while the number of people being admitted to UHW was "small", there could be "a small increase in the number of people in hospitals".

Chief Clinical Officer for the health board Sioned Jones said health officials are trying to establish a link between the patients and each other, meaning any contacts the people share also need to be quarantined. The health board said it had acted quickly to "stop the spread of the virus in the hospital".

Ms Jones said: "We know that the best way to reduce further local transmission and prevent this disease from spreading is to be vigilant and ensure people stay at home and not invite others to come into their household."

"If anyone has symptoms or is concerned that they may be at risk of having coronavirus, they should contact their GP or NHS 111." She said that the cases identified so far do not appear to be "a matter of concern for the wider community".

There are no currently suspected cases of the virus at other hospitals in the region, and the chief medical officer for Wales, Dr Frank Atherton, said it was still possible the cases could have been imported from elsewhere.

A review of the available data and information "reveals very little that gives any cause for concern", he told the Senedd on Thursday, but said a "considerable" number of people are being tested, with the aim of completing 4,000 tests by the weekend.

Dr Atherton also revealed that an "additional 400" people had been tested in Wales this week, taking the total to approximately 1,500.

Meanwhile, Cardiff Council said the area around University Hospital has been declared a public health emergency. Any residents or non-residents with "clearly-developed symptoms" are now asked to self isolate.
