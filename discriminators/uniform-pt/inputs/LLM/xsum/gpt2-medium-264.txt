bn, as compared with the 2008 level. The figures include:

A 3.4% increase to the capital Gains Tax

A 3.3% rise to the income tax rates

A 1.6% rise to the corporation tax rate

A reduction in stamp duty

A 1.3% rise to the housing benefit cap

The ONS also says:

£33bn of the 3.4% rise in the corporation tax rate to 10% from 13.5% in 2009 will help to support productivity by giving businesses greater incentive to invest and grow. This is due to a 3.6% inflation-busting rise in UK retail prices which has hit the spending power of many small and medium-sized business owners.

The ONS also says:

Other changes to tax arrangements:

Tax rates for income from investments; capital gains and dividends on capital gains from other sources are capped at 0.3% of income for families and individuals. Those who fail to register new investment properties will not be able to convert them to capital gains and dividends.

The minimum capital gains taxation rate for new investment income is currently 4%.

The capital gains tax rate is subject to a 50% threshold. This means that individuals who don't pay the tax can only benefit, at most, from a smaller reduction in their profits if their account income falls below the rate. It's a system that requires businesses, not individuals, to pay.

The Government insists that changes will boost domestic demand with the tax changes. However, the ONS says the changes will boost output.

The main impact of the tax changes will be on households, with the rate of tax on investment income being more likely to decline, as household wealth grows, rather than higher.

Other proposals include a 30% increase in the standard rate of income tax for those aged over 65 and higher earners.

A tax on businesses to cover the cost of tax on new investments and the change for income of the 50% tax threshold (or 1% at the 10% rate for incomes above £1m, or 6.5% for incomes above £10m, to cover the cost of a one-off levy).
