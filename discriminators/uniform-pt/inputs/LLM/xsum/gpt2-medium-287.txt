seekers take down the famous cheese rollers in the middle of the desert.


According to the official website of the Central Al-Quds Forces Front, the event was "built upon solidarity between people on the ground and those whose homes were captured during the military occupation."


For a long period it was believed that the event was organised by members of the regime forces – but it turned out that the cheese rollers' organisers were actually the rebel fighters of Jabhat al-Nusra, formerly ISIS – who were reportedly the cause of the event.

I came to watch the Central Al-Quds Forces Front (CARCF) Central Cheese Rollers on November 5, 2010 @ 18.00 local time with a group of people from Cairo. I left Egypt in August 2013 and arrived in Idlib last Thursday as I was going to visit my father with another girl.

Since I'm coming from Egypt, my name has been used throughout on social media – mostly from people who are friends with me. When I first arrived in Idlib, the first place I noticed online was the Twitter account of the FSA Central Command, a well-known local unit of the al-Qaida affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra. It is not clear to me why this account chose to announce that one of its fighters was the leader of the Central Al-Quds Forces (CarcF). While the CarcF are an independent organisation with its own leader. However, in my experience, it's the first time the media uses the name of a local brigade to promote any media story.

The account claimed that after Al-Nusra's control was given to the Assad regime, the Central Al-Quds commanded a detachment to raid the Syrian border during the month of Ramadan from al-Anad on the east bank of the Bab al-Hawa to the western bank of the Bab al-Hawa to protect the border from the rebels. Al-Nusra fighters stormed the border from al-Anad to the Damascus countryside before the Syrian army captured the crossing point
