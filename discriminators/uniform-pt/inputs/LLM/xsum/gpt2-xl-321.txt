 are believed to have put off a medical to sign Lukaku and the Football Association has launched an investigation into whether he should be charged for alleged breaches of FA rules on agent fees, although the process is said to be at an early stage. Leicester have denied any wrongdoing.

Lukaku became first-choice striker for the Foxes and their first top-flight goal since Claudio Ranieri quit less than a year ago and started the Champions League final, before being injured in the first leg of that semi-final defeat by Barcelona and missing the second.

Now the Premier League champions have joined the bidding for the player who scored 23 goals during his first season with Brighton. A statement from Leicester said: "We would like to begin negotiations over a transfer of Jamie in the coming days. He has been one of our players since day one and is regarded by the manager and board alike as a player of exceptional ability. We do not rule out any option if we are unable to conclude a deal. If there is no agreement with any of the interested parties then we will pursue the player as a transfer candidate." It is understood a fee has been agreed.

The Belgian's previous club at the start of last season were owned by the family of the late Nigerian businessman Eugene Asbu, who also owned the Egyptian football club Al Ahly before the latter club was nationalised. Asbu paid an unusual sum of Â£3.8m to buy Brighton two years ago but the club later returned to a private equity group. That group has been running the club since the takeover.

A statement from Brighton said in part: "We wish to thank the Brighton Football Club directors for their kind attention and consideration at the outset of these discussions. The sale of Brighton & Hove Albion is subject to other clubs withdrawing their interest. If other clubs withdraw their interest we will explore next steps, however at this stage no further developments are anticipated. We will be making no further comment while we seek clarity on other clubs' interest in the position at this time."
