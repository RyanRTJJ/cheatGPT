Ms Cafferkey's case has prompted a global discussion about whether foreign countries are safe for people volunteering in the NHS.

But what are those countries exactly. There are several countries that don't have travel alerts on their Foreign Office websites, including Australia, New Zealand, most of Eastern Europe and Russia and the US.

What has been raised by the debate is whether a UK traveller overseas should always be made aware of the security advice.

Ms Cafferkey was first diagnosed with typhus by the University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, after developing a fever.

An infection specialist sent a letter to the government in December saying that "while you may be completely safe at home, it is very difficult to make an assessment without examining the relevant patient".

Symptoms include a high fever, vomiting, headache, diarrhoea and rash.

Ms Cafferkey was treated in hospital for 19 days after the infection was diagnosed in mid-January.

A Scottish Health board worker holds up the letters, which has prompted widespread alarm about foreign patients being used as guinea pigs.

Typhoid has killed more than 16,000 people worldwide in recent years, according to the World Health Organization.

People who drink water contaminated with faeces are at the greatest risk of infection.

How contagious is typhoid?

Although the most common strain is Salmonella typhi, the disease can also be caused by the bacteria S. Paratyphi A, S. Paratyphi B, S. Paratyphi C and other bacteria, but no deaths have been reported in Scotland from these strains so far.
