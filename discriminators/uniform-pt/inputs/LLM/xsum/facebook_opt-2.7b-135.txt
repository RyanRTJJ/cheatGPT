 the first 45 seconds of the season the former Celtic youngster was a no-show at the club's annual pre-season training session.

He was reportedly told that his attitude and character were at opposite ends of the scale from the ones the club demands, and said the young attacker had lost his desire to play with the Magpies.

"I think I have a good eye for talent and I’m looking at some young players. They haven’t been on my radar and I’m looking at two or three - players who I actually wouldn’t have heard about last summer.

"We do look at some of the young lads - as there’s some good ones coming through.

"I know they’re not up to Fullarton’s standard, but we need good players."

Aberdeen boss Ferguson said: "It’s just one thing after the other. It’s a difficult job and we work long hours. You’ve got to be a team. If Aborah is coming in late, or if others aren’t there, it’
