 the wind was very strong and made it difficult. I kept hitting it close and made some good putts. Hopefully I can keep this going over the weekend and get the job done on Sunday," said Lee.

This week is the fifth anniversary of Knox’s outstanding victory in the US PGA Tour Championship. The 33 year old moved into contention in Scotland with a three-under-par round of 69 to reach four-under-par and joint fourth and he remains hopeful of mounting a serious challenge over the weekend.

"Hopefully I can take advantage of the strong winds and get myself into contention in this tournament. I want to give my best shot and hopefully the results will follow," said Knox. "Approaching the weekend, the major goal is to stay in the mix and hopefully I can put together a good score and maybe find myself on top of the leaderboard come Sunday. That’s what I’m aiming for."

There are nine players within five shots of Lee’s lead and with high winds forecast for the weekend, some surprising names could be crowned champion on Sunday. Scotland’s Robert MacIntyre is one of those in the hunt and he is the main challenger to Lee’s lead. MacIntyre is just one stroke off the lead after a five-under-par round of 67 saw him move to six-under-par.

"It was nice to get some birdies under my belt – it’s been a while since I had a good round," said MacIntyre. "The goal over the next two days is to keep playing as well as I can and keep myself in contention."
