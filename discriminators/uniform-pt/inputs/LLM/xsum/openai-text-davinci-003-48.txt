lto Adige can now learn both Italian and German in school, despite protests from far-right parties.

In total, the region is home to some 500,000 people, with around 58% of the population speaking Italian and 42% speaking German. German speakers are heavily concentrated in the towns of Vipiteno, Sterzing, and Bressanone.

The 130 families, which make up about 1% of Alto Adige's population, live in 120 different inhabited centers, primarily in the region's Brixen, Eisacktal, and Ahrntal Valleys. They are mostly of Romanian origin and speak the Romanian language. In addition, some of them also speak German and Italian, along with the traditional regional language Ladin.

The presence of the families in Alto Adige dates back to the 1950s when work from their native country was not enough to provide them with a sustainable livelihood. In addition, they also enjoyed more rights and better economic opportunities in South Tyrol as compared to other parts of Italy. The families have since been living in South Tyrol and continue to do so in spite of various pressures and attempts to force them to move elsewhere.

The families remain mostly invisible, living on the margins of the local economy. With the recent Italian government decision to allow the Italian and German languages to be taught in schools, some of the families are hoping their children will gain better educational opportunities in the area. In addition, they are also hoping to receive more recognition and acceptance in the local community.
