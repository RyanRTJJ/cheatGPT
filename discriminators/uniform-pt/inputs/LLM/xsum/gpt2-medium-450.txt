 president of the AAU, he told graduates "the time for politics is over", but later said the policies being proposed "do not reflect a genuine view on the matter". A year ago he warned that if the Tories did not get the upper hand in 2016, universities may struggle to recruit staff. Speaking to the AAU on 20 June 2013, he said: "What do you have to lose? A very expensive university education for many many years. I know many of you have been told that this is a terrible deal... My position is that it really does not matter whether you go to an expensive university or an affordable university education. It matters just how many students have come through the doors of universities throughout the United Kingdom in recent years. It does not make a dent compared with what you could have done without an expensive university education.... There is no way that I could have negotiated any better deal."

Mr Hamilton criticised cuts to funding and support in order to help attract the best and brightest students, saying his "principles of public administration and business management [are] in sharp contrast" with those of the Coalition. The cuts of his own university would mean that a fifth of the University of Sheffield would no longer be open to undergraduates until 2026. In his final speech as president of the AAU, he told graduates

"In short, this will mean that I believe it could take 20 more to 30 years before you get any of these opportunities."

A further 30,000 postgraduate students would have to take two years outside university. The cuts are just one part of cuts coming to the budget, with university budgets under pressure from a combination of inflation, cuts in admissions and cuts to research budgets. University of York's vice-chancellor said on 25 February that more than £350m in grants would go to university for the coming academic year, down from £500m over the same period
