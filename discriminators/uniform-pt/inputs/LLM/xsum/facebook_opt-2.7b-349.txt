 necessary permissions in place to go ahead".

Birmingham City Council said it was too early to comment on the planning application for an unnamed site but that work to reopen rail lines would not "cause any disruption" for locals.

"This is the type of exciting development that will attract young families and bring more people and investment to our city centre," it told the BBC.

"We are aware that there is a local concern over potential disruption to local public transport but in terms of the application itself which has already been lodged we do not have all necessary permissions in place to go ahead."

The government said while it had welcomed the council's commitment to the Birmingham Connected area it had to ensure the new town "works for everyone".

Planning permission could be granted for the scheme in the next few weeks.

The site is near the city centre but a local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said it could cause "significant development".

"I'm frustrated at the lack of progress," he told BBC West Midlands News.

"There's been talk of this idea for 20 years and I'm tired of waiting.

"There are some big developers around here, some multi-national companies that would like to be a part of the area, and many of us think this is an opportune time to start something and I'm very disappointed with the council's pace."

He added that the planning application had never raised enough concerns for the project to be cancelled before the latest council election.

The area where the scheme is located has had a chequered recent history.

Last year, plans to convert an existing warehouse into a residential block was blocked by the City Chambers.

A previous scheme for apartments and a retail district was also rejected by the city council.
