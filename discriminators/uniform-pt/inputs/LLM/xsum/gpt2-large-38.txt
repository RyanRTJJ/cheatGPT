 joined in recent days to discuss the offer.

The Wrexham board is expected to meet in early October before making its final decision.

'No interest'

Wrexham Water was founded and runs three sewage treatment plants from south Wales to the English coast.

It has a total of 3,000 employees and an annual turnover of £350m and its largest asset is a 300-year-old salt mine.

In a separate development, RBS, Britain's biggest bank, has agreed to sell its North Sea business to Lloyds Banking Group and National Australia Bank for €17bn (£13.1bn).

Lloyds owns about 100 businesses including RBS, a mortgage company and the Bank of Scotland.

They have joined Lloyds Bancorp and Royal Bank of Scotland in selling their banking arm, while Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group are expected to report earnings details next month.

There were reports in the past week that RBS may sell its business in the North Sea to help the rest of its business to meet an unprecedented challenge from the likes of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloydie Bank.

Lloydie Bank's chief executive, Charles Dunstone, said on Thursday it was not in discussions with RBS or any other bidders.

"As RBS's parent, Lloydie Bank works with the Bank to manage its risks and is currently working towards achieving a new strategic relationship with Lloydie Bank," his spokesman said.

He said it was "unlikely" any decision on future operations would be taken before the Bank's annual general meeting on 10 October and, "no interest is being expressed".

Lloydie Bank's chief executive said: "Lloydie Bank's shareholders will continue to support us in pursuing profitable growth and long-term benefits to customers."

Lloyd's chief executive Sir Philip Hampton said: "Lloydie Bank is currently evaluating the full range of business opportunities, given our current high levels of liquidity."
