 4 years ago, he has been barred from leaving the city.

On his Facebook page Hickey claims that he was framed by the city on ticket touting. He wrote that he wanted to take his case to the media and said that he believed that the Rio council would support his claim.

The Facebook page also has an endorsement from the ‘Lion’s Den’ bar of a Mr Anthony Tafoya, with the same message of demanding justice and his release.

Mr Tafoya said police showed him a picture of Mr Hickey, but there was nothing to connect him to the events.

His claim contradicts the evidence of witnesses who said the man they saw at the bar on September 7, the day after the Olympic opening ceremony, was a man who they were introduced to by Mr Tafoya, who had also claimed they were at Rio’s airport bar that afternoon.

The Facebook page also has a photo of someone claiming to be the man that Hickey is accusing of being framed. This photo has no face in it but appears to be a picture of the man that police claim they tried to interview on September 8.

When approached by Q Radio on Sunday night, an unnamed person with ‘personal knowledge of the case’ said that they had not heard of this man, but that it is not unusual for police to say that they were trying to interview people they have arrested and have a very good reason to want to see them.

The person added that the situation was still very fluid, so police could change their line at any point and make an arrest that did not lead to an investigation.

The Facebook page is a hoax. Q Radio approached it directly and asked to check its content,
