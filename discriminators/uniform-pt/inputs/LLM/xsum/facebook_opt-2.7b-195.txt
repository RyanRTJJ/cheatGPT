, have been postponed.

The Queen had an operation for an unspecified illness on April 1, when her two sisters – Margaret, 90, and the Dukes of Edinburgh – accompanied the monarch to St Bartholomew's Hospital in the City of London.

She spent 13 months at the same hospital from April 1991 until March 1993 after an operation to remove a tumour from the pancreas. She is understood to have had the tumour removed safely.

But she is said to be in generally good health, and would likely have felt the pain but not required hospital treatment.

According to the Sunday Express, her illness is not cancer and the monarch is now expected to remain in hospital till late October or early November.

The Sunday Times reported the duchess and duke of Edinburgh would accompany the Queen to the funeral, which could take place in the late spring of 2014.

The Sunday Express understands her illness was not a result of her father King George VI passing away last month.

It suggested it was related to the stress of the recent court hearings for her four sons – the Prince of Wales and his offspring William and Harry, and Charles's siblings, Camilla and Andrew.

But her spokesman declined to discuss the reports. BBC royal correspondent Jonny dyer said she would have been treated for two to four weeks in hospital if her condition was "severe".

And he said the duke and duchess's future plans would depend on how she recovers.

"There needs to be more clarity on what it is before they decide what is possible for the duke," he said. "And I have to say in terms of the duke he would love to see a family event rather than an event on TV."

Mr Dyer also said the duke could take a little time to recover given the age of his wife – 90, the Queen Mother of 1953, lived to be 105.
