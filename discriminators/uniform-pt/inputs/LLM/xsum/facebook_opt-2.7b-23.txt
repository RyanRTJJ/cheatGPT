 rush of concern from animal lovers but an appeal was launched on social media to find a volunteer to take the animal away and put it down at another location. The force said the animal was a danger to life and that an animal protection order had been put in place while officers tried to find it a safe and appropriate new home. They had put out an appeal on Facebook, telling people to contact them and describing the foxhound as a "dangerous and unpredictable dog" or "highly intelligent and playful which is out of its mind for fun".

North Wales Police posted on Facebook: 'This foxhound can not be brought under control in North Wales and has to be destroyed. 'It's only safe option is to put it down in the early hours of Monday morning. 'To anyone who is able to help please contact us as a volunteer will be arranged for the foxhound.'

The rescue appeal was flooded with hundreds of comments calling for information to help locate the foxhound. Hundreds of people also shared the appeal on Twitter, with many suggesting the animal should be destroyed. Many of the comments suggested that volunteers could come to North Wales to collect the foxhound themselves and take it away. The force has apologised for the distress the situation has caused but added that it believed it was in everyone's best interests to destroy the animal.

Chief superintendent David Williams said people should get in touch if they could assist by taking in the animal: "We would like to make it as clear as possible that this is not an animal anyone wants to have in their garden but it is out of our hands and out of the hands of the owner. After a careful assessment of all the options available to us we have agreed the only option available to us is to put it down. "The welfare of the foxhound, itself and the community is at risk of being jeopardised by its ongoing presence in the area. "We believe it's in everyone's best interests to see to it that the foxhound is removed from the area, put down and removed
