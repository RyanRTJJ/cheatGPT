Kelly, who scored a role on the show after being spotted by a talent scout at a charity event, says he will miss the crew and the acts who have appeared over the years. 

He said: "I would like to thank everyone at BGT for their incredible amount of creativity and hard work, especially the amazing crew and acts that have been a part of the show. I feel privileged to have been part of it. I wish the team continued success as the show grows and evolves."

The show's influencer, Simon Cowell, released a statement in which he thanked Kelly, saying: “We are sorry to see David go, he’s been part of our BGT family for the last few years and a great judge and poet. We thank him for all his enthusiasm, positive energy and great judging over the years, we will miss him!"
