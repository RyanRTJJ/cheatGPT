 new drugs and better treatments for people with brain diseases like Parkinson’s, epilepsy and other conditions linked to brain damage.

Sally Pacholka, who was diagnosed with advanced-stage lung cancer last year, is one of those whose disease progressed much faster. Her disease went into a stage where doctors can do very little, and her family decided to stop treatment and let her die.

Today, she says while she and her family have been blessed to see the research pay off and she has learned a lot from her experience, some things remain out of her reach.

“The one thing I wish I could have is peace of mind,” says Pacholka, whose family is struggling to pay for a private medical specialist to help them deal with her condition. “The only thing I think of is, ‘what is on the horizon for me as far as a cure being out there, and when?”’

That’s the hope in this and other stories around the country, where researchers increasingly see a way to get drug treatments into the pipeline much sooner and more effectively.

The push comes as Congress has taken over the issue of health care reform with this year’s passage of the stimulus bill, which includes nearly $200 million for a program called the Accelerating Medicines Partnership. It funds work to speed up the development and approval of new treatments to improve life for patients with serious or debilitating illnesses and conditions.

“Accelerating medical innovation is about using government resources wisely to bring us closer to making meaningful progress,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. “By helping us understand the most promising new approaches to the development of improved treatments, these initiatives can save us time and money on trial and error in the future.”

Congress mandated the program in the stimulus bill, which will be put into effect at the start of this year. The partnership also involves public and private funding, and will work with the National Institutes of Health as well as the drug companies, biotechnology firms and academic research centers that make up the life sciences industry.

Accelerating the development of drugs for Parkinson’s and other conditions requires that scientists get much closer
