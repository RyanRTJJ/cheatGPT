ze alcohol duty if it wins power from Labour in next May's National Assembly election.

The CAMRA said the number of pubs in Wales is currently 5,523, down from 7,237 in 2001, with a closure rate of about two a day. The Campaign for Real Ale said the main problems for pubs were the availability of cheap supermarket booze and high taxation. 

The Welsh Conservatives have pledged to cut Business Rates for pubs by 25% by 2020 if they win power in the upcoming Assembly election. The party’s Leader, Andrew RT Davies, said the policy is designed to help protect the “fixtures of Welsh society”. He added that the Welsh Conservatives would also, “suspend alcohol duties on all draft beer and cider, traceable back to Wales and produced by small Welsh breweries”. 

The Welsh Conservatives have argued that their proposed policies would be more effective than those proposed by the ruling Welsh Labour Government and would help pubs, particularly in rural areas, survive the current difficult climate. They have argued that this could also help boost the Welsh economy and keep people employed. 

The Welsh Labour Government has criticised the Welsh Conservatives’ plans and argued that cutting Business Rates and freezing alcohol duties could be counter-productive, as it could encourage “irresponsible drinking” and increase health and social harms associated with alcohol misuse. The Welsh Labour Government added that it had made its own efforts to help pubs, such as providing a £1m fund to help smaller pubs and providing grants to help pubs become “Community Hubs”. 

It remains to be seen if the Welsh Conservatives’ proposed policies will be implemented and be successful in addressing the issue of pub closures in England.
