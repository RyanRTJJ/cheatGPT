 was arrested last fall in a raid on his office.

The Hong Kong chief executive also urged a review of press rules there to prevent an erosion of press freedoms.

Meanwhile, a group of pro-democracy bloggers says they plan to organize a "Day of Defiance" demonstration against Beijing's "repressive measures" over the weekend.

The planned protest will be in response to more than a dozen arrests of journalists this week.

"We feel a profound sense of injustice, we feel like we been arrested, beaten, and abused," said Pui Hwee-cheung, a member of Hong Kong Watch, one of the activists' groups backing the protests.

"Our country and Hong Kong have been taken over by a dictator," Pui said. "We hope that this will not be the last Sunday."

The U.S. State Department also on Friday asked the U.S. ambassador in Beijing to raise the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping, a State Department official said.

The U.S. Embassy in Beijing is "concerned enough to keep the ambassador informed and keep him updated about what's happening," said the official.

The protesters' movement was inspired by a series of student rallies against Beijing-inspired changes including the implementation of a law that allows extradition to the mainland for crimes including political views critical of the Communist Party.

The movement has intensified since its first demonstration on June 12 when tens of thousands of people took over the airport for two days and clashed with police several times. The student activists remain small and have only organized several small sit-ins outside Chinese consulates and embassy over the course of the year.

The government's growing repression of the protesters in Hong Kong has helped galvanize Hong Kongers behind the demonstrations, who have been largely peaceful despite the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by the Chinese police.
