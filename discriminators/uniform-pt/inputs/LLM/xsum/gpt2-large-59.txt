"I would be very sad if, you know, we do have a referendum on this in this day and age," Mr Lawson said. "But at least we would have the opportunity to say that the Crown is not the only means of the governance of the country. Other things need to be done in this country and we have to move very quickly to put ourselves in a position where the people of Scotland can have the same type of democracy."

The Scottish National Party is in favour of independence. It won a majority over the Tories in the 2014 Holyrood election and a similar majority will be elected in next month's Scottish Parliament elections.

On Thursday night, Mr Lawson and fellow Brexit minister Anna Soubry led a campaign to get British voters to vote to remain in the EU single market and customs union last month's Brexit referendum.

The UK Independence Party â€“ the far-right UK Independence Party, or UKIP - is polling at between 7 and 14 per cent, although it has not made an official decision, despite holding events in several EU regions this week.

Mr Lawson said that although the Tories are trailing badly in the polls, they have a very good job in forming the government.

He asked: "We know that the Conservatives have a very good working relationship with the EU and with the Labour party, not least because they've been the political party that was most critical of Brexit. It would be very nice to think that, if the Scots had taken us out of Brexit and not joined in with the Tories, they would have become a real governing party in London and they would have got on well with everyone here in
