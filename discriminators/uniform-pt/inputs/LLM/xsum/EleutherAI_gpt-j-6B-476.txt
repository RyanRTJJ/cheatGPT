 year and a half.

But many analysts and businesses see the ECB as the only remaining option for the first step in the return of the eurozone bond markets that have languished because of record-low yields since the sovereign debt crisis began.

This week’s U.K. inflation report, for example, showed that prices rose unexpectedly in October

The currency hit a four-year high against the dollar on Thursday after Bloomberg published the ECB’s latest forecasts. It was the strongest against the dollar since late December 2010.

Bloomberg’s own economists, however, said they saw no need to follow suit, given that the forecast was far removed from markets’ expectations of 0.7%. Nor did they suggest the forecast was a prelude to higher borrowing costs in the coming months.

“The fact that the ECB forecasts have been rising gradually in recent weeks does show a shift in the central bank’s stance to a more expansionary position but this does not signal higher rates ahead of time,” said Carsten Brzeski, a strategist at ING Group in Brussels.

The central bank expects only a modest increase from the 1% forecast it published last month when it lowered the growth outlook. The new forecasts are due to be released on the second day of the ECB’s bimonthly monetary policy meeting.

The Bank of England will also keep its key interest rate on hold later this week, according to forecasts from nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg that showed at least three of them see it rising by at least half a percentage point. The ECB’s benchmark rate, currently at zero, will be lowered by the end of this year.

Bank of England Governor Carney said last week that it was too early to say if the British economy would face a “slower-than-expected” recovery this year.

Markets will be watching for signs on rates from the ECB meeting, which begins on Wednesday and extends for two days.
