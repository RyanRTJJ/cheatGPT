 of an ancient technology".

They claimed energy from water in the water would be more efficient. But critics have warned the proposal is a "scam".

'No alternative'

Aberdeenshire Council's chief executive Gordon Dewar said: "We've heard that people object to the scheme.

"The council's objective is to generate a renewable source of energy, and this is the proposal that the council's committee has agreed with us to pursue."

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said today the plan was "not viable or a priority".

It said: "It would have to be at least four times more efficient (to make up for) the energy lost in the transmission lines required."

There is "no alternative" to renewable energy as fossil fuels would increase the climate change problem and the earth's surface had a finite resource.

They also believe the cost could reach up to a thousand pounds a year.

However, the director of Scottish Renewables said the scheme would work "in principle".

He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: "We would suggest that it's going to work in principle provided that you do the engineering and the planning that will allow this to work.

"When you have three rivers available and they are going to be fed by a solar-powered power station it has to work."

The first phase of the plan will be to build seven hydro-electric generators on the Gala in Galashiels, with the other stages looking to build nine further.

Construction will begin in 2012 and they believe it would take five years by the end of 2013 to supply enough energy to Scotland and surrounding areas.

Hydro-electric power stations have long been used as a means of generating power.

They have historically been made up of tall mountain peaks, as the water can be controlled by power.
