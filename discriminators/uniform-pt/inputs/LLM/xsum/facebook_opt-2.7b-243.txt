 million people by 2050 â€“ a figure many experts argue is an exaggerated forecast.

"We believe that a radical public health response is required, one which will take many of the long-term recommendations from the government's Health Protection Agency into consideration," said Dr Thomas Farr, a consultant in microbial ecology at King's College London.

The group of scientists said that the government should support investment in "innovative, world-leading projects" and the sharing of expertise with developing countries that could be used to combat multidrug-resistant bacteria.

"Given the importance of antimicrobial resistance, it is essential that the government sets out a strategy that will address the problem of drug-resistant infections," they said.

"This strategy should be based on an understanding of the epidemiology of drug-resistant infections in the UK and globally, the need for the UK to adopt a comprehensive approach to prevention and treatment, and robust evidence from the scientific community about the efficacy of the strategies available."

The group warned that the failure to prepare for the emergence of resistant bacteria could lead to an "epidemic" of deadly illnesses, including pneumonia, septicaemia, infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and tuberculosis.

And given the rapid pace of change in medicine, it was predicted that the death toll could be greatly heightened in 20 years' time, they said.

The experts noted that some of the most harmful bacteria, including E. coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter jejuni, became resistant to most drugs only between 1990 and 2000.

"However we have shown that resistant bacteria can emerge and proliferate in the population of the UK even more rapidly," they said. "In the 1980s only a small fraction of our population was infected with these bacteria and this figure has rapidly increased over the same time period."

They added that resistance to penicillin and to some older antibiotics had "already devastated public health in many parts of the world, from south-east Asia to the Pacific and from east Africa to west Asia".

They emphasised that resistant bacteria
