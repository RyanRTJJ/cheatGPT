affected four workers on site when the blast occurred at the premises in the Sutton Lane area of Congleton at around 12 noon last Thursday 6 August.

Search teams, led by Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service and working alongside Cheshire Police and colleagues from North West Ambulance Service and Highways England, have now recovered the three bodies from the scene of the incident. Inquiries are continuing to locate the fourth person.

A further search of the building has now taken place and the area has now been declared safe. All the key assets of the company on site were subject to the search including the wood driers, and a thorough examination of the plant was carried out.

Our thoughts and sincere condolences remain with all of those affected by this incident, and we continue to work closely with the families at this difficult time.
