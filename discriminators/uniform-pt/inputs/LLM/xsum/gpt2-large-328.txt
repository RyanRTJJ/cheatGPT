 the move to more cycle-friendly driving conditions, with three out of five journeys being made on foot and two out of three made by a bike.

A new survey of 2,000 drivers by motoring website TheRoadtoNow.com has revealed that even women are dropping their cars a fair bit, particularly between the ages of 35 and 50, which The Mail on Sunday describes as a'major threat to the UK's car industry and the economy'.

The report also found that female drivers now make up 27.1 per cent of all traffic in the UK, up 12.6 per cent compared to a decade ago.

It's true that the UK is currently building the roads so that car ownership isn't inevitable, but it's a far cry from creating a world in which everyone has a choice, especially in some other countries such as China and India where young people who would otherwise not have the means to buy a
