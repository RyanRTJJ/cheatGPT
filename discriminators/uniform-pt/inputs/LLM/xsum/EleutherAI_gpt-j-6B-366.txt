 be jailed again in April and in June.

A MAN convicted of five years’ jail for exposing himself to six youngsters in a park has been told by police he will be jailed a second time and in a third time in as many months for a similar offence and for illegally possessing a weapon.

Kenneth Ward, 68, of Chop Gate, was jailed in January 2011 after admitting exposure and harassment offences. In June 2012 Magistrate, John Brien, sentenced him to an additional seven months in prison for firearms offences.

The father of four was arrested again on Monday and charged with repeated offending, with police claiming he exposed himself to the youngsters four times in the area.

At a hearing at Manchester Magistrates Court on Tuesday, Magistrate Brien ordered him to serve a further five-year jail term and confiscate his shotgun for six months in April.

And in June this year, after Ward refused to comply with a probation officer who ordered him to attend a psychosexual treatment programme, he was sentenced to another eight months behind bars.

Ward, who was granted bail between his trials, today said he was disappointed at the decision because he had learned from his experiences.

The father-of-four, who appeared in court by video link from prison, admitted four out of seven offences and admitted to using threatening or abusive words or behaviour and intimidating others. As a result there were breaches of the peace.

He was sentenced to 21 months’ concurrent custodial terms at Manchester Crown Court after being convicted of five offences. In July 2013 he was jailed for a further two months for an attack on another person.

He was accused of pushing another man out of a public bar in Hulme and assaulting, beating and threatening to kill him at knifepoint. He had arrived at the premises following a long-standing feud with a man who was in the building.

Ward was also previously jailed for six months for exposing himself
