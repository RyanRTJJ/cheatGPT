 and Morningside areas of Dunbartonshire in Scotland.

It later emerged he was involved in online grooming, and had been abusing children for more than a decade. He killed himself in 2015.

On Saturday, a report was published in which the council recommended that the Scottish Parliament consider setting a minimum age for sex offenders entering supervised living arrangements, such as care homes, under a strict regime where they must report in regularly with their victim support worker and submit to searches.

Mr Nelson admitted a total of 14 charges, of which one was sexual intercourse with a girl aged ten to 16.

In 2009, when he was 53-years-old, police found evidence at Nelson’s home, in the Morningside area of the city, which showed child pornography. DNA analysis established that Nelson had abused at least four girls in that period.

In 2012, he was arrested on suspicion of child sex attacks, after it was revealed he had been abusing young girls since 1998.

Police believe he then left Scotland around that time and moved to England.

Another girl, aged 15 to 16, informed officers that Nelson had taken to abusing her on social media websites, but was not able to name the date during which this happened. The girl did not know the name of her abuser, or any of the locations they met.

She reported her allegations in 2014.

A further suspect, aged 43, was also arrested. Both of these men could face charges of attempting indecent assault.

Mr Nelson was also charged in connection with child grooming on an adult site. He pleaded guilty to two charges and was sent to the high security category 3 unit at Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow.

Nelson was deemed to be a significant risk to young children by police.

The council’s report stated that there were no safeguarding arrangements in place for Nelson or his children while he was living in community settings. It said that he would have been monitored if he had been living in one of the council’s supported houses.

But, since there was no plan in place for child safety, Nelson was allowed to re-enter the community. This included taking a job as a teaching assistant in an infant and toddler playgroup
