 a good feeling. I'm delighted and I can't wait to wear the shirt again", he told the club's official website.

Januzaj now has three goals in eight Manchester United appearances. The teenager was forced off injured in the second half, with his side two goals down. He is expected to feature more regularly after Van Gaal suggested he's good enough for a bigger role in the first team.

The striker, also 18, admitted that he was disappointed not to be awarded a penalty as Van Gaal's United cruised to victory in Friday's 2-0 home win over Sunderland, which sent them top of the Premier League. "As we played in a very fast way, I had the chance to score the goal, but I couldn't score", he said.

"I'm disappointed not to score", admits the 19-year-old.

"My decision-making in the first 15 minutes was better than the decision-making in the second half", he said.

David de Gea had been on course for a clean sheet but Sunderland's goal stemmed from a Januzaj mistake.

While De Gea's saves in the early stages meant it was just a matter of time before United scored, any hopes of a comeback were dashed by an unfortunate own goal. "The game was a bit nervous," he admitted.

"It's very disappointing. I think if I have scored that goal, I think we would have been in a much different position, but I'm disappointed not to score, not to help the team and the fans in the situation we're in".

"It's very important to score as many goals as possible because it's a new season".

As well as scoring the goals, he's become a big part of his manager's plans so far this season.
