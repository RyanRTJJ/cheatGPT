 after halftime showed his team's lack of faith, he replied simply: "No, they don't."

"We've got to keep playing the right way, because I think you got one away and a goal away and we all knew we were going to get one more away," he continues, "but you have to keep looking in the box and not have the focus and not have the attitude that we need to be to win."

When asked if the defeat was just the inevitable fallout from that attitude: "I don't think so. We did beat Leeds and the one thing from it was that last ball in the box had hit me. I'll have to take my hat off. There was more pressure in there and we won the first couple of games, that's all about keeping pressure. I think we started getting too aggressive, and I think that's when they won."

One player who has no confidence in what has been established to be City's weakness is striker Fernandinho. After not recording a goal since midweek, which he admitted was more worrying than not scoring: "It's something that's coming a little quicker and a little bit stronger than usual because I think the team is trying to keep us in games, so we're keeping pressure, we have to get forward and get out of positions."

After the draw, after the three-point gap, City were confident they had managed to create enough in order to make a strong run to within a point of top spot, although their form since Monday must have been enough to persuade them the season had not been completed perfectly.

They should have scored three or four more goals in the second half to leave them with enough to fight-back from a two-goal lead. The game had been settled, but they would have enjoyed this last-gasp win more were it not for Fernando after a fine strike on the edge of the area from Raheem Sterling, which ended in a corner for James
