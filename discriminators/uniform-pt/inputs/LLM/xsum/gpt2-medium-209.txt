 time any institution has done so under the capital-raise scheme.

Dr Michael Devereux, director of GCU's Center for New Economy, said: "We believe it is right for both public and private institutions to participate in this process, and the potential of the network is enormous." He described a network of institutions investing in small-scale micro financial firms offering loans, and said at the time of the ICO a single investment could generate up to £200,000 for each institution.

Dr Devereux added that the loans were made for businesses "who are not making enough money – that is, not earning enough before tax, and have little capacity to finance themselves." He believes the projects will have an impact on both small and large financial institutions.

According to Devereux, several companies have emerged out of the micro-lending scheme, which includes two lending institutions, one at a single bank, others under subsidiary companies. There are also more than 170 partners, many of which are banks, including Lloyds, RBS, Ulster Bank and Wells Fargo.

The capital-raise scheme provides funds for such new lending arrangements, or in the case of large private firms, loans extended by their shareholders. By June this year, micro-loans have been made available to some 890 businesses operating in 21 states, Britain and US. At the ICO, more than 170 companies have registered with the scheme.

The scheme requires that small banks, credit unions and local authorities, along with small commercial institutions, participate in the creation of micro credit vehicles by allowing banks to issue credit to the public. They must follow some rules such as a minimum lending cap or loan ratio and undertake a loan-for-the-purchase relationship that requires no minimum deposit. Banks are not obliged to hold money within or on behalf of all their customers. As loans are issued on an over-draft basis (where banks withdraw funds from a checking or money market account at the end of a given day), many financial institutions are
