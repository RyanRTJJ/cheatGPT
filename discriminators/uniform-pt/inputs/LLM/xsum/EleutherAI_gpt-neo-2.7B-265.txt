 followed by a ruling from the National Secular Society which recommended that such terms should be replaced as they were deemed to dehumanise and trivialise lesbian and gay communities.

The organisation’s decision to stop Google’s censorship has been praised by many and has received thousands signatures and comments in support.

“It really is important that the BBC gives equal time to men, women, transgender and gay as well as straight folk,” said Jana Thompson, head of strategy for the National Secular Society, speaking to PinkNews.

“We’re very proud of this and really want to celebrate the decision and send out a massive ‘thank you’ to Google for taking on this incredibly important fight.”

In a statement issued by the NSS, they said: “Our decision to remove Google’s restriction of ‚lgbt‘ is a victory in the fight for LGBT equality.

“We know the language of ‚lgbt‘ is hurtful and often contains homophobic slurs. Such phrases dehumanise LGBT people, make us feel ashamed, inferior, and that we are not wanted or loved.

“We call on Google and other tech companies and their social network sites to make LGBT inclusion a priority. We believe that equality begins with making LGBT inclusion a priority.

“The decision to remove Google’s restriction on ‚lgbt‘ is a strong step towards LGBT equality.”

The decision comes just three days after Facebook introduced a similar change.

Speaking on the BBC’s Radio 4 show, Jeremy Bowen called the move “a very big deal”.

He said: “It was really important that he made the decision, given his responsibilities, but he seems very, very passionate about it.”

It comes a day after a high court judgement found Facebook’s planned changes to its privacy settings did not go far enough.

The ruling said the current system for blocking thirdparty apps cannot be used to effectively prevent gay people joining the sites.
