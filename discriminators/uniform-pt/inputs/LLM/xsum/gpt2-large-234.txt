Pep Guardiola's arrival in 2013 has had the reverse effect on the team. Despite signing Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero and Mesut Ozil while he was manager, Spurs are now the league's least likely side to avoid relegation.

With their Champions League semi-final first leg against Shakhtar Donetsk on Sunday, Rodgers is hoping to see his players on the pitch as often as possible in what promises to be a memorable finale to his spell in Scotland.

"We'll try and keep our players fit," Rodgers said. "We had a big game here at Liverpool and it was important to win it. We haven't done that as often as we should.

"I think we'd be disappointed were we to finish 13th in the league. We would do better to finish in the top 10 -- we have some talented youngsters coming through in the second half of the season and we can give them a proper kick.

"But it's very important for our fans that we try to get the most out of them."

It will be Liverpool's first Champions League away game after six years. Rodgers said the Liverpool squad, backed up by their manager and the backing of the Liverpool Supporters' Trust, is ready to take on the Germans.

"From the first minute we showed great character and belief and we will be prepared for it," Rodgers added. "It's not easy for Liverpool to play against us but I hope it'll give them a great performance for Sunday's game and an experience they can carry into the match against Munich.

"I'm looking forward to it. It's a game that brings out great character. We're going to give everything as we know who we are as a group."
