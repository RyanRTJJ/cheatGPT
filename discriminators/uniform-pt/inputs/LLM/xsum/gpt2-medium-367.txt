 put concrete blocks around the house and to use hand tools to demolish the front and back of the property. It was to take place in December last year. Daniel, who was born in England, has previously admitted sending threatening texts to family members in Pakistan. In their latest written reply to the police complaint Daniel said he had "done nothing wrong". He said: "They didn't do anything wrong at all. Every home I've ever lived in has been demolished, but nothing has gone wrong." He added: "The police and people here know if it's not because I'm not giving permission I'm not breaking their property and I'm doing nothing wrong." The Police Investigations Directorate is investigating how Daniel was allowed to build on the former estate. A source described how Daniel, who is also known as Daniel and Patrick, and his brother are seen as "out of step" with society. Neighbours described being fearful of any intrusion from Daniel and his brother or his friends when they live at home. They said they were told that Daniel and Patrick often had loud parties at their parents' house. Daniel said in one message to one of his victims: "I need to be involved tonight. No one wants to hear this." In another message he says: "I am leaving now. If you are coming to pick me up I will give you full details by telephone at 11pm or on foot, we will leave." Daniel is accused of taking a group of teenage boys to a house and smashing a front window to gain access to a bedroom. He also sent messages to a 14-year-old girl saying: "No I don't like you, I hate you I am just going to see if I can get into a house like that." He is being investigated by detectives in London. He was arrested, charged and later paid a Â£2,400 bail.
