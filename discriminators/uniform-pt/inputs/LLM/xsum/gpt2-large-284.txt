It also has the backing of the Auckland Council, the Police and Transport for Auckland Transit.

Cycling groups were angry that the new rule would force them into a corner, especially when they currently have little difficulty making it in the shoulder, and also argued that it would make it harder for them to get a place on a bus or trains.

Trevor Molloy from the Auckland Cycling Campaign, said the way drivers behaved in the last six months of the year had been so poor, he had to buy a new car.

There was also the danger of "stray" pedestrians and cyclists, especially in congested areas, he said.

Motorists were being "rude and ignorant" and should change their behaviour, Mr Molloy said.

Under the proposed change drivers must give way to cyclists who are turning right into oncoming traffic, but also before turning right towards the centre where motorists must yield to cyclists in the centre and also if they have to turn left to go across oncoming traffic.

In both cases, any cyclist who enters the left lane must give way to anyone entering directly into that lane and even if they did not have to, drivers must give way to cyclists in the same way.
