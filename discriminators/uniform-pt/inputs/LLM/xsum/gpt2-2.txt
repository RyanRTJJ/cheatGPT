 when they are not reporting directly about the issues at hand. As an example, I find that one of my patients has an addiction to nicotine and it has been taking over her life. I am an employee of a large company. My husband is a high income businessman so his family needs food. He has a chronic diet of refined carbohydrates and he is using all his money to pay for his house. His health was devastated when his health insurance was cancelled. But he survived. When I see those that have been hit by the drug companies, I make sure to call them. They will make things happen for years. There has been no serious public hearings since the pharmaceutical companies started taking up the issue. The FDA has closed the investigation into drug company companies and they cannot continue to regulate them. This is an extreme abuse of power by a government that can and must investigate. The people who are directly affected by this government's actions should not allow the people to get away with doing what they want to do. That is unacceptable to the rights of those who are victims and as a public health campaign, you should speak out.

How to take action now if you don't know who's on the drugs that are in your clinic? You can contact the FDA or your local doctor to get their recommendations. Please note that as of March 26, 2013 there are more drugs in your clinic and more patients have been exposed to them. The federal government is funding several agencies to work on effective prevention programs, but I believe it is time they look beyond those agencies. I believe that public health has an important role to play in educating our youth and for public policy to be able to get a grip on them. To help them understand that public health agencies need to be involved in making those choices for public health. I look forward to seeing you on January 15th.
