s of their pay deal continue.

The agreement with the Kenyan Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) was signed by the Ministry of Health and the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC). This provides the union's members with an increase of 16 percent in night duty, on-call and weekend allowance to be backdated to June 2018.

The deal was reached after a week-long strike that saw thousands of health workers nationwide downing tools in demand of higher pay. The union claimed that the current allowances paid to medical staff were inadequate to meet their day-to-day expenses.

The Government of Kenya is yet to sign a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with KMPDU which is the main sticking point in the pay disputes. The KMPDU has noted that neglect of the terms of the CBA was a major reason for the strike.

The CBA is a contract between employers and employees that sets out the terms and conditions of employment, including wages, roles, works hours, etc. It was recently renegotiated in 2016 but has yet to be implemented.

The strike has underscored the crippling job crisis in the health sector, particularly for healthcare workers who are paid extremely low wages and are deprived of basic rights. The number of doctors that resigned from public service increased by 58 percent between 2015 and 2019, creating a vacuum in the health sector.

However, the agreement to increase and backdate allowances is likely to improve the living conditions and morale of medical staff, and restore trust in the health system.
