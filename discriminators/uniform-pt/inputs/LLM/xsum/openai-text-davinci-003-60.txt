The Order of Malta, or the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta (S.M.O.M.) was founded in Jerusalem in 1048. It is a Roman Catholic lay religious order with origin in the Knights Hospitaller, a group of Roman Catholic monk knights founded in the 11th century to provide care for sick and wounded Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land during the crusades. The Order of Malta is a sovereign entity whose constitution is based on the French Code Napoleon. It is not a country nor a part of any other country, but it is recognised as a sovereign subject of international law. It has diplomatic relations with over 100 countries and is seated in its own headquarters in Rome, Italy. Its members are known as knights and can be recognised by the white eight-pointed Maltese cross they wear.
