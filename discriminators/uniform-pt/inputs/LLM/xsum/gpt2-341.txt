kg of machinery from Fiat in November 2007, and a deal to make a new £1.75bn £12bn "high road" road transport line. The company is being bought by FIM which will buy up to a combined 11%.

This represents a €10bn increase over the previous year, when Fiat, owned by John Dalhuisen, the country's finance minister, had been a chief shareholder. Dalhuisen's predecessor in the post, Jacques Cousteau, would have been the chairman of the joint board of directors at Fiat, which had its stake in GM.

GM made an almost two-billion euro loss from this deal over the last two weeks. GM insiders said there was no possibility of them ever investing in the Italian carmaker for the foreseeable future, or of being sold to Ferrari. They said Fiat had to be put under pressure by its own shareholders, including Mr Duggan, who was chairman of GM's board when the deal was brokered in August, after he found himself embroiled in an intense political battle over his ownership and how he would spend his money. "He was looking for a new start. He wants to be the next CEO of Fiat," said an Fimini source.

GM would now have had to take on a different role than it had under Dalhuisen. "We are talking about an organisation that has decided to make money from making money for itself," said a GM source. The deal gives GM $1.5bn for its operations and £600m in debt; it also takes on an additional $500m in debt in 2014. The deal would come in tandem with the €3bn investment by Fiat, which has already sold around 12% of its shares to GM.

However, a former GM source described the GM deal as an "important element" of his £10bn investment. The GM sources were told how it could enable the company to invest in a third company, or perhaps two, of
