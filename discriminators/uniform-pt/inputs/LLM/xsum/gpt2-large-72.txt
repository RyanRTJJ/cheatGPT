 then blackmailed into making more than Â£180.

The scam is similar to the one in which Ashley Madison chief executive Noel Biderman allegedly gained control over more than 1,500 women - the personal details of hundreds of them - after he hosted a'sex shop'.

Two weeks ago, the head of the Metropolitan Police's Internet Crime unit said he could see a "silver lining" to the rise of child abuse and sexual exploitation on the internet as he said internet service providers had a "huge" role to play in stopping it.

He said: "I have a lot of concerns over people using the internet to hide their identity, to keep information safe. It is not only a crime but a national security issue."

Khan later said he could not have been clearer that the police service would not tolerate such crimes after the two men were jailed for life by Mr Justice Leveson.

However, there was mounting criticism online that not enough was being done to tackle child abuse.

Writing in the Guardian, journalist and child sex abuse campaigner Anna Kavanagh pointed out that social media sites may have prevented Mr Perry's fall.

She said: "With all Twitter activity happening via the Tor network, the most likely suspect here was a teenager.

"Tor is used as the secret internet which hides who is behind anonymous chat sites."

Mr Khan responded that Twitter was also an ideal target because of its worldwide reach and users had a constant supply of "trending" content to choose from.

However, he added: "The most recent high profile user to be sentenced for child sex abuse by Twitter - in 2013 - was a 16-year-old boy (anonymously) who was also being blackmailed by a group of users."

The Independent on Sunday contacted Twitter for comment and the company directed us to its press office. It said it was "too early" to comment as the matter was before the courts.
