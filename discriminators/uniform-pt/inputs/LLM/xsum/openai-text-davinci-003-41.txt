 shot in the back of the head by 15-year-old Farhad Jabar outside NSW Police Headquarters in Parramatta on Friday last week.

"Any preaching of hate, any preaching of intolerance of other religions, is not only a rejection of our fundamental values, it undermines our sense of mutual respect," the Prime Minister said in a speech to the Executive Council of Australian Jewry in Sydney.

"It is a rejection of the values which form the basis of our society, the basis of our freedom, of our democracy and the basis of our safety and security."

Mr Turnbull said terrorism, extremism and hatred around the world were "dangerous and serious threats".

"Those who argue that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam betray a woeful ignorance of the ideology and objectives of those who practise Islamist extremism," he said.

"Groups like Daesh, al-Qaeda, Hamas and Hezbollah seek to draw their ideology from interpretations of the Islamic faith, however twisted those interpretations may be."

He said it was important to take a stand and that violent extremism had "no place whatsoever in our society".


"We must remain united, stand strong and together unambiguously proclaim that we reject terrorism, reject extremism and reject hatred and intolerance. We must all reject, or at least challenge, any suggestion that violence against us is because of who we are, or what we believe."
