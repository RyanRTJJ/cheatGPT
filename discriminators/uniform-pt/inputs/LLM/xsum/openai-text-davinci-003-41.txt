s emerged as the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) published new guidelines aiming to cut the use of Tasers against children. 

The statistics relate to police encounters between 2014 and 2018, during which time officers drew or engaged Tasers 202 times against young people aged between 13 and 17. In most of these incidents, the weapon was pointed, but not discharged. According to the figures, six-thirteenths (43) of the 13-17 age group were aged between 13 and 15.

The IPCC guidelines say the use of Tasers on children could only be justified in extreme circumstances and that “the safety and welfare of the child must be the primary consideration”.

“Taser use must be considered only when absolutely necessary and proportionate, after other tactical options have been considered and when faced with a threat of serious violence towards the officers, another person or a group of people,” said the IPCC's director of operations, Dave Smith.

“We have serious reservations about their use against children, and therefore our guidance is focused on explaining when their use may be justified and includes a risk-assessment approach that should be applied in each case.”

The GLA Conservative figures also show Tasers were deployed 82 times against 16 and 17-year-olds during the same time period. While use of the weapon has been on the rise in London, overall use is still below the levels seen in other parts of the UK.
