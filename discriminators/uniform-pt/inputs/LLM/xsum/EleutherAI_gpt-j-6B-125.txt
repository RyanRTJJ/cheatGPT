. The 27-year-old left flanker plays against South Africa in the upcoming Rugby World Cup in September. Hogg says his side should be praised for their success in the autumn internationals, with Scotland's record-breaking run still one of the most impressive achievements of the game. Scots boss Gregor Townsend has stressed the importance of repeating recent performances ahead of the World Cup. The squad had lost all four matches in the 2013 tournament, though Scotland have yet to beat the Springboks. I suppose I am in a fortunate position - I can go out and win and have a good time playing the game I love. But the squad is more in tune with that attitude - we want to beat anyone

Matthew Hogg Scotland flanker Hogg, 27, was happy with the win over the world champions but admitted the win was not easy against a side which has not beaten Scotland since 2006. And they're one of the best sides to ever play the game The Scots went to New Zealand in 2014 and put on a fantastic performance against the All Blacks - who went on to win by 23-12. That gave the players a taste for World Cup success - and the world is now their oyster. The first challenge for the squad will be to repeat their achievements in England on 2, 5 and 13 March, when they face England, France and Ireland. Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend was full of praise for his players after a stunning 33-12 victory on Sunday. He is now the biggest winner of the summer as his side finished the 2015 edition of the international season unbeaten and with the bonus of a tournament-clinching bonus-point win over the hosts on Twickenham's home turf. We've lost four of our last five, and I thought the first 40 minutes in that was a huge test for us. But it's fantastic that we've won all of our games of the autumn - and now we have a taste for more. Townsend's side
