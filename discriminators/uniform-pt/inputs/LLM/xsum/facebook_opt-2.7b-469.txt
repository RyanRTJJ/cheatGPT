 believe it should be used now – the lowest level since its use was enshrined in law in the 1960s.

At the same time, the percentage of Americans who believe capital murder should only be carried out after proper identification by a jury of peers is up sharply since 2005, climbing from 29% to 40%, and, among millennials, from 11% to 19%.

The new poll also found a stark increase in support or opposition of both the death penalty and euthanasia in the last few years.

A majority of Americans continue to oppose both forms of euthanasia, though both have been rising in recent years. While 72% say they oppose killing in self-defense for people who have the mental capacity to understand right from wrong, about one fifth (21%) say they support it. Just 4% say they strongly oppose it.

By contrast, 51% oppose the death penalty for individuals who commit “non-negligent homicide”.

And by a 56% to 28% margin, Americans say people are allowed to be euthanized when it improves their quality of life. Yet by almost the same margin – 50% to 35% – the public does not think doctors who deliberately harm people should face legal consequences for manslaughter, a crime which has the death penalty as an option, and has also seen a rise in support since 2012 (see full poll results here).

The polls come at the same time as a new report by a bipartisan congressional task force, headed up by California Republican Representative Darrell Issa, which found that support for the death penalty is falling across the country, especially with millennials and Latinos, in the wake of controversial police fatal shootings that have been widely condemned as unjust.

In addition, the number of Americans supporting capital punishment has fallen for the first time since 1972, when the Senate approved an amendment banning capital punishment in all federal cases; a Gallup poll taken in September found 47% support, 44% opposition, an 8% drop since that time.
