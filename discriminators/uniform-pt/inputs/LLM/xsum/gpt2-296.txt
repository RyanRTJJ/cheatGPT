 Labour-Green majority appears likely.

Labour said ministers should consider whether there should be a vote on a Bill.

"This Government has shown they do not like the Bill," said Labour. "The question is, how can the Government not take steps to protect those who live in vulnerable communities?

"There needs to be some legislative basis to help people with difficult economic circumstances afford to live in this country after Brexit and ensure they can afford to pay their mortgage. That is where this Government's work is starting to pay attention."

The trade union lobby slammed the Government's plan to scrap free movement agreements.

David Lammy has previously said that many Trade Unionists will not support joining the Government.

Opposition trade union leader James Anderson said Labour had no choice but to scrap the deal, noting that Labour had already lost control of the trade union movement when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took office in 1979.

Update (11:35 p.m.): The union has called for a vote not to scrap the Bill despite a request by Andrew Robb, another member, to abstain.

The union will call for a vote by Thursday.

What is the Trade Union Bill?

Trade unions have long been an integral element of social democracy, but recently they have been forced to withdraw their membership amid renewed fears of attacks from the Conservative coalition.

In the past, the association has faced a series of lawsuits over alleged unfair labor practices by those it represents, including unions accused of demanding a strike pay increase or forcing workers to pay higher wages.

It has since withdrawn its membership from the Commons as a condition to a Conservative government.

In 2012, over 100 unions successfully sued Prime Minister David Cameron over a "redress of union membership" that claimed that "the Bill creates uncertainty in the trade union movement and compromises its autonomy."

The UAW called on MPs to take up the matter during parliamentary deliberations on Wednesday.
