 help have poured in from business and civic leaders, with one minister saying they were "overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the station".

On Friday, the council released a proposal outlining how the station would be redeveloped over the next five years, leading to the relocation of the existing bus stop next to the site, and the installation of a new £1bn bus station.

The plan, which will go before the council's cabinet next Thursday, proposes a £50m upgrade of transport links, including new bus services, plus improvements to a number of major roads, such as High Street.

The new station will be situated at the northern end of the railway's South Gloucestershire line, near to the current station at South Gloucestershire.

The planning application suggests the railway could continue to operate trains to South Gloucestershire, although many stations already serve both stations, including the original station as the Central line was originally named.

Richard Crossley, chairman of the Gloucestershire branch of rail company Govia Thameslink Railway, said the company had no objection to the plan but had "not seen the details until today."

The group have a contract with West Coast for the use of the Southern rail platform.

There has been fierce opposition to the plans from local residents at several protests, including one outside the station's gates.

Councillor Tom Whittaker, leader of the Gloucester, Shropshire and Gloucestershire Conservative Group, urged locals to back the proposals in a letter to his party's general secretary, Tom Walker-Smith.
