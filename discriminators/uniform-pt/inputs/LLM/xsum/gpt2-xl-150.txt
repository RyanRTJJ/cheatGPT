The two women were first charged with "inciting violence" last month, a charge they deny, and held in jail together in a single cell, with the women's feet connected so that the lights in their cells would never be turned off.

But the charges were amended to include "denouncing the revolution," the Associated Press reported.

Ms Machado, who was on loan to the US from Venezuela, remains at the Caracas' Metropolitan Prison.

She has denied the allegations, saying they are "made up" by the government in order to discredit her and that she is being intimidated.

On Tuesday, President Maduro said the women and other activists had been "blackmailed" by the US authorities.

"The US wants to keep us from winning the legal battle to defend democracy and constitutional order and its institutions," said President Maduro.

The government wants to strip Mr Lopez, a leftist politician, of Venezuela's vice president in a separate trial.

Both the US and Venezuela have condemned the arrest and the accusations against them.

'Dictatorship'

On Tuesday, some 30 members of Mr Lopez's Popular Will political party, which was officially banned earlier this year following an alleged plot to oust him, attended a rally calling for their release.

Mr Lopez, 34, who has been held without charge or trial since August, described the charges against him as "political persecution".

"We are not scared of repression or the courts," he said in the rally, which was held in Caracas.

"We want them to leave us alone so that we can do what our ideas demand: free people from dictatorship."

Venezuela was briefly placed on a US economic sanctions list in 2011, but President Hugo Chavez later reversed the decision.

He also issued a decree in 2013 that legalised gay marriage in Venezuela, which drew condemnation from the South American nation. A subsequent referendum was held this year to ratify the vote.
