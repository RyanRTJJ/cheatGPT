 be hurt if he was blocked because "we need to have a voice that is able to explain this complex world to the people on the other side", but added that Dayan's nomination was "not likely". He may yet win the cabinet vote. Israel's foreign ministry said it had not taken any steps to prevent his nomination from being approved.

"Israel will not let this happen, obviously," Deputy Foreign Minister Tzachi HaUliel said in an interview published on Monday.

"Dayan is probably the best person available to be ambassador here, so this is not likely (to happen)," he added.

His nomination was announced on March 25 by Brazil's far-right President Jair Boves, but his confirmation process has been slowed by Brazil's new Congress and Boves' attempts to remove the power to nominate from the state governors.

But the situation appeared to have stabilised as Foreign Minister Aloizio Mercadante's ministry said he had proposed Dayan and "the government will be examining it and will make its decision in due time".

Mercadante has said that "the government has great affinity with the nomination of the Israeli ambassador" and on Sunday Dayan was still waiting for the endorsement of his ministry.

He said Israel and Brazil had excellent relations and the nomination came as a "special gift" from president Boves.

"We are talking about a brotherliness, not a rivalry or a struggle of a historical nature between us. I also want to make it clear that there is a great affinity between both citizens, both people, and there is a great affinity between both countries, both countries need each other, both countries have much in common."

A Brazilian diplomat in Geneva said he was "not surprised at all" that Israel had nominated Dayan but added that "the US does not like him".
