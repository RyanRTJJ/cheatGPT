HALIFAX - Halifax Regional Police are looking for two men who failed to return from an outing Sunday on the White Bluff mountain.

They had just climbed the 1,200-foot peak and were making their way back to base after their final descent when the weather closed in and the group got caught in heavy fog, said Staff Sgt. Peter MacLellan, Halifax's first constable assigned to the area.

"There were two other people who had climbed and gone back down the mountain," MacLellan said. "They said they were unable to get back on that hill. They were unable to see the other two in the distance."

It was a sunny morning when the first two men left the base of the summit.

From their point of observation, the white summit on a ridge along White Bluff Road is visible when the fog lifts.

There are no signs that the two men were anywhere in the vicinity when the weather closed in.

The three climbers were unable to get back down the mountain by walking in the fog.

"There's absolutely no way you can do it by yourself," MacLellan said.

To make things even more difficult, the fog had caused the group to get lost.

Halifax police have been searching in the area in an endeavor to find the climbers.

"That would be in their best interests and ours," MacLellan said. "The hope is that other people who are in the area in search of the missing people would stop and talk with us and we would lead them to the area."

There are no lights within walking distance of the ridge and it is unknown how long the search will take, he said.

"Our major concern is ensuring that they come back alive as soon as possible," he said.

Police also expect to ask for the public's help in locating the missing men.

Anyone who sees the two men or who has information about their whereabouts are urged to contact Halifax
