 afternoon left at least 33 people dead.

The bodies were retrieved from the first rescue operation on Wednesday evening, with the second set to run until Tuesday.

Five of the 17 victims found in the first search were rescued. Four of those are still missing under a police cordon, in separate operations on Thursday.

Two-hundred and fifty firefighters were tackling the blaze. The first casualties were trapped in stairwells, and one person is still missing, said the South Wales Fire and Rescue Service.

About 20 people had gone to the scene on Wednesday to help but now most people are having to be rescued.

A total of 29 people were rescued on Thursday, with one trapped and one rescued in a second rescue. Seven of those were taken to hospital.

The first dead man was a father-of-five thought to have died after a struggle to keep himself from falling while trying to rescue children in the sixth safe room. The second was a 40-year-old woman who suffered serious burns in the fire and died.

The sixth and seventh safe rooms were also flooded before the blaze got under way, prompting a seven-hour operation to rescue people trapped inside and extinguish flames.

The injured were helped into trucks from the sixth safe room on Tuesday. But they were later removed - by police helicopters - by the police's air operation.

A woman was found alive and well in another vehicle, but she was later removed. Some 15 other people are feared dead.

Two police helicopters have joined teams from West and West Wales as search operations continue in the area of the blast, south-west of Cardiff.

The operation has been assisted by air ambulance services, fire-fighting experts and an aircraft company. More than 3,500 firefighters have been called in, and helicopters fly over the site four times daily.

Firefighters were trying to prevent anyone being exposed to flammable materials inside the premises.

Residents were informed of the fire on Tuesday. However, residents were told not to go home after the blaze,
