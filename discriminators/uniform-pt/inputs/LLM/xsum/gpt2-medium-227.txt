 that comparison was made and denies lying to the police.

Mr Ison said Mr Ison's account of an earlier meeting at where Nikki Sinclaire gave misleading information about her marriage to Mr Ison was accurate in that it did not show her marrying him and he had been involved for a short time.

He added that in the meeting when Mr Ison raised objections to a party nomination, her response was that she had to accept the results of the election because there was no way for her to win. She was then asked if there was the opportunity to do this with her newly proposed marriage and she replied 'at that point I could not answer'.

I think if someone doesn't know that their candidate is the candidate they are against, that is a good defence. She has been accused of making false statements and that was all before and during the vote.

Mr Ison said the events of February the 14 were very traumatic: he felt a sense of betrayal and he was unable to attend work at the time to raise concerns because his son Michael was in hospital.

The decision to allow him to do was a matter of mutual affection.

I did not give the reasons why this was done. I never considered having Michael come back for the meeting in that situation but I was sure he was ill so that was part of the plan.

He said he felt responsible for his actions but thought he was justified. What I could have done in the present situation would have been to seek advice in Mr Ison's constituency office on the outcome to all the issues on which there may have been discussion about if I had gone to the meeting to raise concerns or was simply told it would take place and asked why my views did not matter to him as his candidate. If I got back at him I might have been prepared to have further legal action
