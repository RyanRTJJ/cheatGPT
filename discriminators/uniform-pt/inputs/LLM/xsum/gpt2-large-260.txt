 measure over five years ago.

Last year the health minister Arlene Foster, a former nurse, described them as one of her proudest achievements.

"If we get this right, the packets will only contain information that is true and accurate and it will not make a distinction between the brand and the brand name. It will work much like nutrition facts which is not easy to get right, but I believe that's the way the majority of people look at it â€” not as a nutritional bar or supplement but as a good bar."

She added: "They are good for people, good for the environment and good for business. We will have something which looks clean and not put in front of our kids on the way to school and at the doctor when they go. It's a good measure of what's really eating their children."

But opponents argued the measure was too vague and that it could result in health warnings being over-broad and confusing. There would also be legal challenges as the European Commission would not be legally obliged to change course.

The first warning packet was not distributed in Ireland. It was designed in the UK but the European parliament rejected the idea of introducing mandatory warnings for food.

One campaigner, Anne Pinnock of Ireland's Consumer Action Forum, said: "We're not asking for any kind of super-food labelling system to appear. We want accurate information in place on packaging as well as the text on the front of the packet. "

The Government should be considering whether it should continue to use the NHS body that is overseeing nutrition labelling because many of the measures it has introduced over recent years were introduced by ministers under its control.

Food standards have not been updated since 1983. In the past three years they have been introduced in Northern Ireland, Finland and Canada, while New Zealand will introduce them in 2017.

There are also more than 20 other food labelling measures in place, including in North America over dairy on frozen food that can be seen only by those with particular health conditions.
