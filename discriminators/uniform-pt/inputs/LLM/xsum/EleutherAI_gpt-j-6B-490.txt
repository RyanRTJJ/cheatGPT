The government of Sanaa claims it has agreed to a Saudi-brokered ceasefire in eastern Yemen to pave the way for peace talks, to be held in the Saudi capital Riyadh.

The proposed truce would come into force 48 hours after talks begin, according to a statement from the Yemeni government made on Tuesday.

Yemen’s armed Houthi movement said its chief negotiator Saeed Hutaibi rejected the deal and asked for time to study it.

After initially saying it would not back a government backed by the West and Saudi Arabia, the United Nations joined the dialogue following a meeting of the Security Council in Geneva on Saturday.

Peace talks have been held in Kuwait for nearly two months, but have made little progress due to the Houthi delegation’s refusal to cede territory or to discuss a proposed prisoner-release deal.

Yemen has been wracked by conflict for three years, since the Houthis seized control of Sanaa in September 2014.

More than 10,000 deaths have since been reported by the United Nations, although the true tally is believed to be much higher.

Fata, the western coastal Yemeni province that borders the Red Sea to the south, has become a major hub for international aid and relief operations since the conflict began.

Its port of Hodeida is Yemen’s main source of imports – including food – and is under blockade until a peace deal is reached. UN officials say at least half the 3.5 million population are in need of food.

Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mainly Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, launched an air campaign in March 2015 to push back the Houthis and restore the exiled, Riyadh-allied president Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.

A war monitor says the conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives and left more than 60,000 people wounded.

It has also forced more than 3.5 million people from their homes – three-quarters of the population in need of urgent assistance.
