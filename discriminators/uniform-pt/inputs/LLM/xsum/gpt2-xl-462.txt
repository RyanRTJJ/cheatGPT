One such case involves a 25-year-old factory worker from South Korea who was found to have an increased risk of brain cancer, according to a report in Korean media last month. Samsung said that the man had received a full recall of its battery for the company's Galaxy phones.

Samsung has said it is looking into the matter, although details have so far been limited. The South Korean labour ministry has confirmed it is investigating the case under labour law.

The company has also apologised to relatives of victims, which in rare case have brought expressions of support from union leaders. But in recent days the Samsung boss, Jay Y Lee, has faced a growing backlash from furious workers enraged by what they said was a cover-up.

"It is very shocking that Samsung did not disclose the problem to us, or give us basic information," said Lee Seung Yoon, a Samsung worker from its Samsung Mobile unit in South Korea. "There has been a lot of pressure from the union to give the workers false hope. We have had enough of what they have done."

The workers said they were first made aware that a battery was faulty when the phone they were using exploded. Later, they said they went to the factory to report the issue.

However, rather than doing so with the union, it was the head of Samsung's global management organisation, In Jong Kim, who presented their findings to them, said the workers said. "I told them we would take another look. But they are just pushing us off to the next meeting. They don't even tell us that there is a dangerous situation. It is a disgrace."

They also say they are angry at what they saw as a lack of communication from staff during the investigation. One man said the workers were also surprised at the number of cases reported by Samsung.

Korean media has also reported several claims of safety violations in the Chinese factory. The most prominent were caused by lack of oxygen in the air. Another was
