Can Scotland do it?

Scotland have endured a difficult Six Nations campaign going into this game.

They have scored fewer than two tries in eight matches and drawn 16.

"It was an important victory on the scoreboard but I think the main focus for us now is to prepare ourselves for what's coming up in December," said head coach Vern Cotter.

"We have some big games coming up against the best in the world and that is where you want to try to find momentum and try to take a bit of pride out of the team win."

The Scots will be led by ex-British and Irish Lions hooker Richie McCaw in the starting line-up.

He scored 10 tries in 18 Tests for the Scots last year and helped them move within a point of the Welsh at the top of the Six Nations standings.

"The core of our back five has been great to have around," added Cotter.

"After that match, Richie said, 'I have been saying it all summer, I have been saying it all week - they are the best team in the world' and he has come right on about that.

"The players and the coaches really believe in what Richard (Northcote) says at the weekend, that the squad is as good as it has been and it's just about finding ways to get us winning games and scoring tries.

"At the minute it is just about what we will put in place and I don't see that changing tomorrow morning."
