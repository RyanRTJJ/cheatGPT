 Vancouver Sun from B.C.'s Office of Housing show 906 renters in the city are now homeless with about half living in temporary shelters.

Renters like Aisling Peche, who has been homeless for a decade, are living in Vancouver for about a week at a time.

"They're going to have to have a second job – do the laundry, do the laundry, do the dishes, do the dishes, and take care of my cat," she said, adding she's tried to keep up by making the most of Vancouver's social services. "I'm only out for maybe two or three days at a time, but that's usually enough to have the money to pay for a day at the laundromat, eat something and then maybe buy some stuff."

Although she said she feels safe in Vancouver, Peche said she's aware there have been a number of recent robberies in the area.

"Because I do have a cat, people sometimes call me … sometimes they make a joke and they go. So at the beginning of September, I'm thinking, who's gonna make fun of me? There's gonna be no reason to. And I know they probably have knives in their hands to carry them to the cops in case they have any problems. Or they probably just make a joke at the beginning and move on, and come back later."

Peche also said she knows there are people sleeping in cars and on garbage cans for free in the downtown core every night, but she can't blame them.

"They just have to put up with it. I mean, they have to have something. Most people don't work. Most people don't have a house."

But the problem is getting worse because a lack of places to live means renters are spending longer days in shelters or sleeping in cars, according to housing experts.

They say it's also getting harder to prove the cost of a shelter stay.

"People don't want to make that kind of public claim," said
