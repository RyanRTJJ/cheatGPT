'It's very exciting to see, the European people are very excited, we're going to be looking forward to participating,' said Foty Galindo, deputy EU spokesman.

'We are delighted to announce that our EOS voting system is finally here â€” but the whole process will be held on Parliament Hill starting in the second week of May.'

She added that the EOS system had the potential to allow voters to make their own choices, which could be done in less than 24 hours.

The poll results are not yet available.

'As soon as it was confirmed that we could get the vote going on 23 May to get the referendum on 24 May there will be no further questions,' Galindo said.

'We will also go ahead and use that information now until an accurate result, and there is no question of our being denied, no matter how many polls we go through.'

EOS voters will automatically register at 11pm on September 25.

It is in the EU referendum, and there has been no debate among EU nations on whether there would be a single European market.

It is, however, subject to some additional questions, such as why the country had to introduce an electronic voting system or why it needs to have a single, democratic governance.

Some EU member states have said they want the EOS system to be able to do its job.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said he is hopeful EOS will be more than just a voting platform to help those who voted against Brexit.
