Mr Brown's decision to support privatisation, which resulted in the loss of 1,000 jobs and cost the taxpayer £3bn, has come at the expense of public services.

"We have just seen Labour's manifesto promise cuts to frontline services. All these things mean a reduction in the money that British councils can spend on services that actually improve people's lives," he will say on Thursday.

"We should all support more powers for councils. And the reason why is that the government made a conscious decision to try to undermine public services. That would not have happened under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown."

The Labour leader is taking a veiled swipe at his successor who has failed to say whether he intends to reverse the public sector pay cap of nearly £6,000 a year for all workers in his first 100 days.

On Friday, Mr Brown confirmed that he would stick by his pledge to stop the government reducing workers' annual earnings below £26,000.

The manifesto document includes an pledge to give councils powers to decide their service budgets. It also means that local authorities in the UK could "directly manage some services and make them fit for purpose".

'Rebranding'

Mr Corbyn will also say that the party plans to "redefine" the role of the state at Christmas, and call for it to have a role in building a "great" economy.
