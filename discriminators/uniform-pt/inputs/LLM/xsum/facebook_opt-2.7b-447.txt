 sales took place.

The annual growth rate was 3.8% in volume terms.

However, the number of sales is down more than 25% year-on-year in percentage terms at 13,961. There were an estimated 1.2 million homes without any sales over the year as of December 15th (a fall of 13.6%)

The year’s figures come as a ‘surprise’ given the housing market had seen a ‘continued slowdown’ since the initial peak in 2007/8, according to Dr George Robertson, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

“We might have assumed that we had reached a bottom, but then the slowdown started again in the latter half of 2011 and we are now seeing more of the same so far in 2012. The market remains under stress, with the supply/demand ratio still very unbalanced,” he said.

“There are signs of increased confidence at the top of society but this needs to be matched by growth in the market as a whole, so we need to see more sales in the coming months to see any signs of a recovery.”

The total amount of completed house sales for 2012 looks set to come in slightly below last year’s total of 1,959,897 (an annual growth rate of 3.6%) or at least just below the 2010 annual growth rate of 3.8%.

However, this might be an underestimation of the figures given the lack of completions we’ve seen. There was a slight upturn in the number of completions over the second half of 2012 but, with just 10,966 sales recorded over the year so far, this is set to come in below last year’s total of 11,539 (an annual growth rate of 3.1%).

The total number of homes for sale currently stands at just over a million.

The average sold price in December rose 3.6% year-on-year to £179,974.

It’s notable that year-on-year price growth was down year-on-year in four out of the five months in the review
