 renouncing his allegiance to al-Qaida.

Mr Hekmatyar had previously called the UN decision "against the peace process".

It follows calls by a group of Afghan MPs and civil society organisations to ban him.

Human Rights Watch has said Hezb-I-Islami had no valid claim to be part of the government after declaring itself a separate Taliban-like group in 2005.

"Given Mr Hekmatyar's history of violence and the growing threat posed by his Taliban remnants, it seems wise for the government to do the right thing at this point and ban him from the country," said Tom Bowman, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch.

"It will also help discourage potential peace talks with Hezb-I-Islami, which will provide little incentive for Mr Hekmatyar to stop violence and respect for the constitution," he said.

On Tuesday, former Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Qayoom Khan had joined calls for his country to designate Hezb-I-Islami a terrorist organisation, echoing calls from rights groups across the world.

Many of Mr Khan's former colleagues also had supported such a move, saying it was the most effective means of stopping Hekmatyar's violent activities with little interference.

US-backed Afghan President Hamid Karzai has shown little interest in banning Mr Hekmatyar.

Despite the deal between the government and Hezb-I-Islami, many civil society groups have called for Mr Hekmatyar's reinstatement.

In the wake of the UN's decision, the Kabul government confirmed on Wednesday that it had called on Mr Hekmatyar to leave the country.

"His action not only threatens the stability and security of the country and the future peace talks, it also hinders the efforts to reach a peaceful settlement," foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Hamid Mothoon told the media, according to AFP news agency.

Mr Hekmatyar, who is also known as Abdul Badawi, leads Hezb-I-Islami, with the help of the US, Qatar and Tajikistan, and is opposed to any ceasefire.
