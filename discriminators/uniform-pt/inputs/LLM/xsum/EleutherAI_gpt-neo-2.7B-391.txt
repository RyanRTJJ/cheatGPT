 injured in clashes, as people attempted to board trains with large lorries. Hundreds of travellers were evacuated as panic became the order of the day across Britain.

The unrest appeared to boil over at 5am yesterday in Kent at a station in the London area - one of the most popular on the Eurotunnel run. It took place at about 80mph and had no trouble before reaching the tunnel.

A group of 200 migrants stormed into Folkestone station, about 20 miles (32km) west of Dover, after a failed attempt to board a Eurostar train through the tunnel at around 5am.

One station employee and two police officers were injured after a brawl between passengers and migrants erupted near the rail line just before 8am, on Friday morning.

Kent Fire and Rescue Service and police said all those on the Eurotunnel train were forced to be escorted away by British police, although many were injured.

The group of mostly Pakistani and Bangladeshi youths, aged between 16 and 25, were chased away from the station by firefighters and police as many shouted as they attempted to board the Eurostar train via a tunnel in Dover.

Eurotunnel is a major European infrastructure company with around a million passengers travelled on its trains in April and May with a large number through the tunnel every year. A spokesman for the company said: "Our employees attempted to control the situation, and it became extremely heated. They used reasonable force to de-escalate the situation.

"Security staff were able to escort our passengers away safely."

The spokesman added: "We are grateful to the people who have been involved and offer them our very sincere apologies for any inconvenience they have experienced."

He described the situation as "extremely sad" and said the company was working "flat out" to resolve it. "What we would like to see in the coming days is an understanding that we need to work together on this," he said. "The main thing is the passengers get to get from Dover to Calais."
