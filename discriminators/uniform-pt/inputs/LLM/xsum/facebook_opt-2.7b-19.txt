 the end of his wife's pregnancy, describing his role in the death as "terrible".

The 33-year-old was due to marry Ellison in August but had lost their first baby, Ewan, early last year. The inquest previously heard the couple was told in May their second pregnancy was likely to follow a similar pattern, with the first coming eight weeks before the due date of a girl.

The inquest heard medical staff who delivered their son said there had been severe abnormalities with their pregnancy, which had resulted in a miscarriage, and they feared further defects were likely.

"I know it's important, for her, to have an accurate burial and to have Rebecca laid to rest, alongside the child she conceived but sadly lost," Walker added. "But to miss the birth of this baby was terrible, terrible and should never have happened. All I could do was look on and hope the right people were there to make sure there was a headstone.

"I would like to think there is good in me. Being with Rebecca every day made me realise there is good in everyone. I have been told to have some sympathy for me, but we are all human. We all have our own story and we have all lost something. I guess that's how life is. I hope there are no more cases like mine. There has only ever been one person that has let me down."

Rangers signed Walker before his first daughter was born and it became clear he might not complete the pregnancy at the end of last season. The defender, who played in the QPR game against Manchester United at Old Trafford in January without disclosing his wife's illness, added: "The only thing we can do is keep trying. I don't want to think about missing the birth and what it might do to her. I don't want to think about it. It's important not to lose sight of Rebecca."

The inquest heard he was too late in returning to play against QPR in April
