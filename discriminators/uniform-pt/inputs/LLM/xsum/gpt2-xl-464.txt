"Such attacks must end and be prevented. This law is very clear and very just. There is no place for those who believe they are above the law and can attack to strike targets of their choice," she said in comments to Britain's Guardian newspaper, which has published the court order.

A number of Western governments have voiced concern about the attack, adding to tension between Egypt and the rest of the Arab world over its human rights record. The attack follows a wave of violence in which Muslim Brotherhood supporters have assassinated police or attacked security forces and their vehicles in a wave of revenge attacks.

In a statement on Sunday, Morsi said he was ready to speak in defence of freedom of expression and that the attack should serve to increase tolerance of free expression among those who opposed the Muslim Brotherhood.

"Such attacks must end and be avoided. In particular, such a heinous assassination of our people during the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ, for which anyone would have been responsible, is of serious concern for us," he added.

The Muslim Brotherhood insists it is a peaceful movement and condemns all violence. But a recent spate of bomb attacks in which four policemen were killed in Cairo and in the southern province of Minya, which borders the Suez Canal, underline the continued threat posed by the group.

The statement called on Egyptians to accept the decisions of the court and act with dignity and with the freedom to demonstrate in the face of the "arrogance and violence" of those who oppose Morsi's legitimacy.

The Brotherhood has denounced the attack as a continuation of a "cynical plot" hatched by those in power aimed to "tear the revolution apart".

At least 12 people were killed after gunmen, believed linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, opened fire on a march carrying Egypt's top security officials in Cairo
