 out of an EP and tour last year after saying a concert for a record label boss had broken his hip.

"She can't sit away from that," Brown told Channel 5 on Sunday. "We were walking back. She went down on her own and walked up to me and said she's got a cold, she went back up and looked after it and walked up to me, 'You know how tired I am? You just look after me?' So that's the end of that. I think we all know that. And we're really sad."

Reni's manager said he was "shocked and outraged' after his client left her fans with "a shock-like feeling".

Rio, the latest Brazilian city to get mixed martial arts, is famous for being one of the most popular training destinations for Brazilian fighters, with promoters marketing such events and attracting millions of fans into cities throughout the continent.

Reni was not present Monday morning following a scheduled press conference in Dublin.

This is not Reni's first controversial departure from a show: she recently told Brazilian TV station TV Globo she wanted to move to Australia.

"I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to go and look for a new training base," Reni told the Brazilian TV station during a promotional stop in Sao Paulo earlier this year.

It was not clear if Reni was back on the road or still having minor issues off the court with her bandmates. But if she is, she might be going away in style.

"Nagano is like a dream," Reni told a press conference last January after her show in Los Angeles. "People will live their life here. I live my life here. I'm very happy with my life here."
