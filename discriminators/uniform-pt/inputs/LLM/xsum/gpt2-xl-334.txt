 had "mixed feelings" about killing her. In the end Nolan, 34, admitted committing a murder and was jailed for life. It had been his first child killing and the final offence he faced. Mr and Mrs Parker, of West Drayton, Manchester, were seen chatting before their house in Didsbury, Greater Manchester, on April 23 2016. Katelyn's body was found five days later, under a blanket in a ditch.

The boy's father Martin, 43, spoke to the Mirror outside court moments after the guilty verdict was read out. I felt I did all I could as a father to stop his mind wandering and let him think he could cope and live life in peace. Our feelings are very mixed at the moment.

Mr Nolan told the Mirror: "I had a long discussion with Katelyn's mother last night and that's where we discussed how we could both move forward from this, how we could come out the other side.

"We have been in touch with the family and their representatives and are trying to come to a decision what the best course of action is going to be.

"Whatever is going to happen, we want this to be as painless as possible. Because we are so devastated by what has happened, any pain and suffering we suffer from this is going to be extremely deep.

"It's the worst day of our lives." Mr and Mrs Nolan have four other children - daughter Kaylie, 17, son Ryan, 15, and twins Charlotte, 7, and Kaylen, 5.
