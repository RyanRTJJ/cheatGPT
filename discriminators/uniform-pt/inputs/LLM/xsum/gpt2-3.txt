 a record high for digital download figures, which are generally released on a monthly basis.

Tales of Britain's fifth album, "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild," is among the favourites at No.1 on iTunes sales chart, while the BBC's new series "Game of Thrones" and the new TV series "American Horror Story" are both in the top five, topping the chart for their new seasons. The record sales for new television series with an average age of 20 has been held by the popular "Game of Thrones". In 2009, the average age for a new series was 18-24. That figure was dropped slightly for "American Horror Story", "The Dark Knight V," and "Modern Family" (with the series having been released from Fox on Thursday).

Sales of DVDs and Blu-ray of films in the UK topped £1.26bn, beating the record sales of the DVD market and a record for its size in the UK. However, sales by new movie and TV series were down 10pc year-to-date due to the launch of the PlayStation 4. The new consoles also led by the Nintendo Switch led the way.

Last year, sales of a major series – including "Breaking Bad" and "Arrival" – fell to the lowest since 2006.

The year also saw the most number of new titles and releases compared to the previous year and second year to the year last. "The Walking Dead" received just under 1bn units as of February, down on this year's record of 1bn units.

While "Bridget Jones" had a 3.6% year-to-date market share in New Zealand with a 6.7% growth season, Australian-based production company TAS-TV Ltd. suffered a loss of about 5.3%. That's down 2.6% year-to-date, but down from "Breaking Good". Production for "The Walking Dead" finished up for the first time in its six years playing.
