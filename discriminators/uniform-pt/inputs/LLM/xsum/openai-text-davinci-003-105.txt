The report found that the milder winter weather has dragged sales for the third consecutive month, with shoppers opting for spending on items for their homes instead of outdoor activities or treats.

Online sales of home wares, however, rose by a whopping 11.8% compared to December last year.

The High Street Sales Tracker reported that total sales of furniture and homewares decreased by 6.8%, while sales of home furnishing categories fell by 2.9%. Meanwhile, sales in women's clothing decreased by 2.7%.

Commenting on the figures, Sophie Michael, head of Retail and Wholesale at BDO, said: "It's been an incredibly tough month for the high street, as unseasonal weather and waning consumer confidence hit already-fragile trading conditions.

"With consumer spending further affected by post-Christmas belt-tightening, shoppers were only willing to spend on items for their homes, rather than treat themselves to a winter indulgence. Despite this, online purveyors of home furnishing and home wares posted strong sales, as savvy shoppers took advantage of discounted items."

Although sales were down overall, the High Street Sales Tracker reported that there were some bright spots, particularly among retailers selling beauty and health products. These categories posted a 7.7% increase in sales during the month.
