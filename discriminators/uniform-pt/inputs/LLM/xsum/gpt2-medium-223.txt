 The object was later determined to be the ancient Roman ship which some experts believe may be the remains of a Roman shipwreck.

The first video, released Sunday, of the strange object was posted to YouTube by the official site on Monday. "A Roman-class warship with a strange craft floating about in the shallows," it says. Some commenters have claimed the man on the video appears to have a camera, while others have suggested he can be an amateur and is looking for footage that will reveal what he believes to be a secret underwater cave. The underwater search for the vessel has already been expanded to include three ships.

The ship, described as a large-scale Roman battle ship, may have been sunk during the invasion of Britain's islands by the ancient Romans, some say. They have argued it may have been the target of a Roman naval raid. The story of the ship and its wreck has inspired such films as "Pale Fire", also based on the events of the original movie. Archaeologists and naval experts believe the ancient ship could be an ancient Roman shipwreck off the coast of southern France or some other location off the coast of England.

It took the ship more than eight years to make it this far before finding the seabed. Its owner could not be identified at the time the video was uploaded.

"This is the Roman warship, that I know of and that has surfaced just across the shallows. There was no warning," said Christian Bressan, a marine consultant and director of the British Museum on The Ancient Mediterranean near the British island of Anglesey. "It may also hold some interesting artifacts from a Roman era and they were buried there before coming back."

He hopes the latest video will persuade anyone interested to get off their snorkel and find it. "It's a really interesting story. It's one of the best to come across and not just in the past few years," he said. "I've been here for eight years and people aren't really doing anything with all that attention to it even though this is a great example of what can be done with these kinds of
