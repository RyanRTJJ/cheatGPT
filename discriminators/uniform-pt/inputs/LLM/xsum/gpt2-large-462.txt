Workers' rights activists have been calling for the factory to be shut down. But labor activists say the problem has gotten worse over the years despite attempts by Samsung to clean up its supply chain. They are calling for labor inspections to be mandatory in private-sector factories as well.

The union of the Samsung employees' family members said that of the 12 cases where the company's internal health system found serious health risks at workers, only one involved an employee contracting cancer.

The union said the other cases came from employees reporting a urinary tract infection or other serious disease and they were the result of exposure to harmful chemicals used by the company in the fabrication process, as well as a lack of adequate medical follow-up.

"One of the cases involved an employee who contracted cancer after receiving an excessive number of sesame seeds, something that is banned from the manufacturing industry," the group said in a statement.

The company declined to answer questions posed by Reuters about the cases and said it did not think it would be appropriate for it to speculate about workers' families.

Samsung's labor system has not gone unnoticed by South Korea's president, Park Geun-hye, who is pushing for stricter regulations to end abusive labor practices and reduce the number of such cases.

The company, which employs more than 25 million people worldwide, has had a checkered record with labor issues. Some of its suppliers did not pay a wage wage because of concerns about workers' welfare, and some of its facilities were found to be polluting.

The group did not specify which workers had contracted cancer and whose symptoms were reported. But the worker, Lee Jung-ik, is reported as having suffered kidney failure from the radiation
