# Acknowledgments

I first met the author and his editor, Sarah Rees Brennan, ten years ago back when she was editing _Go Set a Watchman, The Crossing_, and _To Kill a Mockingbird_ in her office on the Harvard Business School campus. To this day, I am in awe of both the vision and confidence of someone who had never published a book herself before.

From her first look at a manuscript, we knew Sarah was right for the job from the get-go. She is a consummate professional, tenacious, and always seems to find the best story at the right time.

Sarah is an exceptional editor, who is always available for whatever we need, from feedback on plot, to character development, to editing for grammar and punctuation.

This book would have remained on hiatus during the past two years without Sarah's unstinting support and guidance. She never once stopped looking for the best solution to a problem, even as my own schedule turned over and I became tired and worn down. I love her for her willingness to help an unknown writer make his or her dreams, and I love her because _Go Set a Watchman_ is one of the best first novels I have ever read.

But it is more than the author's story that I want to thank Sarah for. I want to thank the thousands of books Sarah (and everyone with whom she has had the privilege of working over the past ten years) has read: books that have made a difference in my life, that have been a part of a shared world of knowledge and discovery.

My wife, Rebecca, is everything I always wanted in a wifeâ€”she has no problem reading books,
