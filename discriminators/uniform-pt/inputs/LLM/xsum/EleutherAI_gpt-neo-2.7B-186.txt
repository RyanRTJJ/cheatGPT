 an extra $10,000 by the state of Queensland to fund a new state government office — but the money was never handed to him.

The recording, made by the then-State Opposition Leader, Dr John Murray, sparked a scandal that saw the Coalition backflip on the Greens' $100,000 cash-for-access program with no more reward money forthcoming.

This week, when contacted by Daily Mail Australia, the NSW Greens government has confirmed that former Liberal MP Cushnahan was handed a cash donation of $10,000 in lieu of future government work.

The source of the cash also told Daily Mail Australia that a $20,000 was expected from the NSW state government and $30,000 from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency but the money never reached any NSW Liberal MP.

Queensland Opposition Leader Deb Frecklington said she spoke to Mr Cushnahan after the former State Opposition Leader made the recording.

She said that at no time did he ask for any personal gain.

''Mr Cushnahan has made a huge donation to the next government — I am not aware of any other donation to himself,'' Ms Frecklington said.

''His donation was made in the interests of political and public relations because of the revelations about him.''

But Mr Cushnahan told Daily Mail Australia he was not seeking any other donations from the NSW Greens and was simply being asked for a $10,000 payment.

''I have no idea of their motivation for wanting me to give them that payment, I have also no knowledge of this matter, I have not heard anything about it.'' He said he had received the cash and it was returned after his phone conversation with Ms Frecklington.

On Wednesday, Mr Cushnahan announced he would resign from politics, claiming he could not continue with the public controversy because he felt people were only paying attention to his private affairs.

Mr Cushnahan, a former Liberal minister and the leader of the NSW Greens, said the NSW Greens had accepted a donation of $10,000 for a new government office and $20,000
