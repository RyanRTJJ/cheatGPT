" given the scale of the crisis.

Figures published by the Government's Home Office department show that, between October 2015 and March 2016, 78 Syrian refugees in Wales were resettled.

This compares to Scotland - with its own devolved government - having welcomed 615 Syrians between October 2015 and March 2016.

The figures come at the end of the three-year anniversary of the so-called "refugee crisis" - which saw hundreds of thousands of people move to the UK - when some countries such as Germany are now starting to ease some the pressure on their resources and have begun to turn their back on the migrant issue in order to take in refugees from elsewhere in Europe.

In September, the BBC reported that many Britons supported the country's contribution to bringing in Syrian refugees to help prevent the humanitarian crisis from developing further.

But a new report published in the Times on Wednesday said that Britons were showing "little appetite" to help refugees in Europe.

The report said research conducted by the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford had found that a new poll conducted among people 18 to 45 showed a "clear divide" over Britain's role in the refugee issue.

In one poll conducted between October 2015 and April 2016, just 2% of those polled said Britain should offer any form of asylum to Syrian refugees in Europe.

The new study found that a similar proportion of Britons - 24% - favoured Britain helping Syrian asylum seekers and refugees.

However, even these figures are seen as "highly unrepresentative" by some charities.

The Save the Children charity said the figures were "disappointing".

A spokesman said that the figures also showed how far some European countries were away from the UK.

He said: "The UK has been among the leading nations involved in providing protection to Syrian refugees since the crisis began.

"The Syrian refugee crisis is now three years old, and the UK continues to play a key role, working with other governments to safeguard them from violent conflict and save countless lives.
