 Four people were injured as a result, and at least 50 bodies were recovered.

A spokesperson for the municipality of Zagreb says the damage is the heaviest in five years.


Last year, the dam was damaged by a series of dams that failed to contain rising rivers and flood a huge area of land.

The government took measures to try to cope with the river in its new sewage treatment plant.

In total, some 1.5 million public toilets are now under construction, despite a drought.

Workmen, who have built makeshift temporary toilets, have made their way along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers before opening them to residents through a river channel at the center of the dam.

They say they are proud of the water they use and will continue to build the temporary toilets until rains stop.


Rescuers from the city's rescue organizations have also helped villagers. But they are worried that the construction of the new toilets could damage the river because it has no natural drainage ditch - just an old tunnel leading from the dam.


"It has got to be damaged because the river is coming down. We have to stop the construction until there is no rain," said Pedro Serrano Gonz√°lez de Cuiro Sosa from Rio de Janeiro.

The city of Rovira is one of Brazil's driest provinces after having a drought for a decade, according to news agency Estado Todo.

Rivira was built in 1991, with water only flowing through two major channels: one channel for the rain and another for the cool water (soda).

The wetness was the first to slow down and people left the region in the 1980s and 1990s for other parts of Brazil, like Rios Nui, before the first floods occurred. Then one of the main roads that is used to transport water is destroyed.


Many people on the roads are now living in the camps,
