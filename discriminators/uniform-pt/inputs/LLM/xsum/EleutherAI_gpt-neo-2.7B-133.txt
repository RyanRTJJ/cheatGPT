's treatment of customers in the UK and the US.

The company has denied any wrongdoing.

GM has been under fire since it received US regulators' first request for data showing when and where its cars were being driven by US regulators, and when they were being used on US roads.

GM said it had handed over details it said was only part, but "somewhat related" to the data requested by the US government, and had done so in "good faith".

Alistair Booth, GM's head of UK and Ireland government relations, acknowledged that "mistakes had been made".

"We are sorry for the inconvenience caused customers and apologise for any offence this has caused."

In a statement, the company said: "We take our responsibility to society very seriously, and the concerns raised in the UK parliament were addressed at some length in our response."

On Tuesday, a GM spokesman told reporters that GM planned to appeal the European court's ruling so the European Union decision can be reviewed.

The statement said: "GM will not settle with regulators, so GM will vigorously defend the UK-US-Europe relationship and UK interests against the US government's attempts to interfere."

Gareth Thomas, the Tory MP, told the Commons: "It is clear from the statement that there are fundamental differences between GM and the US government both as to the nature of the relationship and our rights and obligations under it. It must be recalled that the regulators have sought data from GM on the exact number of times their vehicles have been on British roads, not just the number of times they have been on US roads."

The Commons Transport Committee hearing will hear evidence on the government's decision to impose fines and orders on GM over the company's treatment of customers. The MPs will also be considering possible regulatory action against Geely, a state-approved vehicle maker.

A Home Office spokeswoman said: "It is vital that safety and security at the ports and airports across the UK are kept
