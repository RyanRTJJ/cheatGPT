 Black Hat USA, which opens on Friday.

The most recent attack was more sophisticated this time around as security researchers claimed to have been able to penetrate the system more quickly, after the attackers' intrusion was first discovered.

Attackers targeted the systems directly, creating a fake version of the medical provider's system which did not contain the backdoors embedded in a more traditional one that could be noticed only with specialised knowledge, the researchers claimed.

They then used a virus called EZ-Recon to take control of the medical providers' networks, including their database. In their report, the researchers describe how attackers targeted at least 50 institutions worldwide, including a hospital in the UK, that use the same system.

The hackers accessed the computer systems of all their patients to steal health data. The attack was initially identified by the security firm Check Point, but has now been independently verified by researchers with Lookout.

The backdoors used in the attacks allow the attackers to view all the data the networks have on their patients, monitor the users' movements as well as the health records they have, they said in their report.

"This gives an attacker the ability to view what information the networks have on every patient," said Erven.

They are able to identify the health records of individual patients by adding their name and date of birth to a medical record. Any breach of the health records can be used to access the whole networks' entire database.

The hackers have been contacting victims to reassure them that they are working on a new security patch, which will be released on March 1, Erven said. It will prevent them accessing patient details to obtain the private code needed to gain access to other network segments too and will block some of the systems from being controlled remotely.

"We are all relieved," said Erven. "The way we have seen it go, it gives the industry new confidence to release a patch." Â®
