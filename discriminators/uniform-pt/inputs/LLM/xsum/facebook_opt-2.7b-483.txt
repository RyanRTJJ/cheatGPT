The Government’s consultation closes on Monday but some large businesses have signalled they will stop claiming back employees’ wages on the basis that it is part-time if it will be part-time or temporary as well. However, the HMRC report says this may not be viable for many firms.

The consultation follows similar moves by the EU, with member states including France, Germany and Italy proposing part-time workers who are not full-timers do not qualify to receive
