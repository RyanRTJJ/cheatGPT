 I/O conference last year. With the new phone, it has added two more modules: an earpiece and a head-unit to take calls.

Apart from the earpiece module, the new phone can also be used with the new Google Home Mini which, according to Google, lets you control your lights with your voice.

The new Google Home Mini also comes with Bluetooth, WiFi and USB support, allowing its use on a range of devices from smartwatches, to Android-powered smart TVs and set-top boxes.

While these features are only made available on the top and latest device, Google has also released a dedicated Google Home for "premium" users. The device lets you control multiple devices simultaneously and connects to "all your other Google devices" and "your Chromecast and Android TV."

The Google Home Mini is available directly from the Google Store for $199.99, while in the US, the device has been discounted on Amazon (for a limited time) to $199 for the same price. You can also find it currently listed for $159.99 on the Google Store.

Update: Google has now clarified the reason for the difference between the first-generation Edition 2 and the second-generation edition of the Google Home, by saying that the two phones are different based on their form factor â€“ the Edition 2 is a more stylish tablet computer with a touch-screen, and the second-generation edition is more like an HDTV.

"The hardware is similar and there is still one hardware difference between the first and second generations that you hear about from time to time," a spokesperson for Google said. "The Edition 2 is for those that want a bigger screen and want a more premium experience."

The decision to release the Edition 2 in the US as its flagship device is understandable as the company is working on expanding its home-owners support to its more premium range of devices
