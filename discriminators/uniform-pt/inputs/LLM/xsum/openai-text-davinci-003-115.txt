The win––the boat's third in this edition of the IMOCA Globe Series–– gives her an unassailable championship lead heading into the ninth and final leg, a 775-mile sprint from Lorient to Genoa, which starts on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Pierre Casiraghi's Malizia 2––a yacht owned by the Monaco royal family––holds an impressive lead in the Open Race. Malizia 2 won the eighth stage by more than two hours, and has a nearly nine-hour lead on the overall leaderboard.

The 11-strong fleet will take on the final leg of the race, once again tackling short-term tactic races within the larger race. The participants will race against each other, with the skipper and crew of the boat across the finish line first declared the winner. 

Having already secured the championship victory, the leg to Genoa will also be an opportunity for Sam Davies on the Swedish boat to reflect on her successful campaign and enjoy the moment of victory.
