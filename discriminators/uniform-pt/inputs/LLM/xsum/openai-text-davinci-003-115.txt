 trial, Khalaf pleaded guilty to murder and robbery. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 18 years.

Khalaf was convicted under the English law of murder which is the most serious offence known to the criminal justice system in England and Wales. This carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment with a minimum term that has to be set by the judge. The judge in this case set the minimum term at 18 years because of the horrendous nature of the attack and because Khalaf had little to no provocation. The judge described the attack as “unprovoked and sustained”.
