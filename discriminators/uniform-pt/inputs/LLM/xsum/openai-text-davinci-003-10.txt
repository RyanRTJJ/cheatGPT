p inform the development of a wider transport strategy.

The contract award, which had a value of £2.5 million, is part of wider plans from Transport Scotland to develop a wider transport strategy for the south of Scotland. The contract involves assessing transportation needs for the south of Scotland, including road, rail, active and passive travel, and other public transport services, as well as identifying potential interventions, such as highways improvements, new public transport services or active travel projects, to help improve travel opportunities.

The study is expected to be completed in Spring 2021, and will inform the development of a new wider transport strategy for the south of Scotland. This, in turn, is intended to support economic recovery, improve access to jobs, reduce carbon emissions and improve the wider environment across the southern region.

This £2.5 million study demonstrates Transport Scotland's commitment to investing in the south of Scotland and its transport networks, and is part of Transport Scotland's wider £6 billion capital investment programme across Scotland over the next decade.
