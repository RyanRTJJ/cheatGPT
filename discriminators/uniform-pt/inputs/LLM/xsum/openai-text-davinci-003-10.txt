politician", and Mr Shapps's team denied the involvement of the then-Conservative chairman.

At the time a Conservative spokesman said: "Grant Shapps has not edited Wikipedia in any form. All content was added by members of the public and must be treated as such."

However, Wikipedia has now established a link between the account and Mr Shapps and published an article about the controversy.

The article, which was updated last week, said: "It is believed that Grant Shapps utilised a sock puppet account on Wikipedia to edit articles about himself and projects that he supported."

It added that the account had been blocked by the site's administrators twice and noted that Mr Shapps had denied any involvement.

The article also listed what it described as "positive" edits made to articles related to Mr Shapps, including changes to a page about the Woodlands organisation, a private business which he founded.

The page said the changes had included the removal of two sentences which were critical of the organisation.

The changes were also made to an article about the Princes Trust's youth volunteering programme, which was founded by the Prince of Wales and for which Mr Shapps acted as patron.

Mr Shapps has now apologised for using the account.

In a statement, he said: "I am sorry for my actions and regret any offence they have caused. I take full responsibility for my actions and have co-operated fully with Wikipedia in their investigation."

He added that he was "fully aware of Wikipedia's policies on editing and had forgotten the specific rule that elected representatives cannot edit pages relating to themselves".
