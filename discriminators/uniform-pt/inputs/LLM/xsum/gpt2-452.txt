 bit of a shock".

Mr Javid's "political life will be very different", he said on "The Big Short" where he was quoted as saying, "I'm going to go, I'm going to quit. Leave"

A White House spokesman told reporters the comments were not about any individual but were shared by "a number of our senior officials, with a view to being transparent about the nature of what we're saying and saying" about any concerns.
