Mr Bennison's wife Charlotte (41) found his body when she returned to their home in Cwmcarn, near Pontblydn in the Vale of Glamorgan, the following day. He was the breadwinner of the family.

A pathologist who examined Mr Bennison's body estimated his alcohol levels at the time of death. A toxicology report revealed no alcohol or other drugs on his system. Mr Mayor told me he was 'absolutely certain' that no drink had been consumed prior to the accident. If that were the case, I would expect to see traces in his blood of a large amount of alcohol consumed after the accident rather than at an hour of the day when he would not usually be drinking. '

Mr Mayor was charged with three counts of causing death by dangerous driving and released on unconditional bail until his next court hearing in September. He has subsequently died.
