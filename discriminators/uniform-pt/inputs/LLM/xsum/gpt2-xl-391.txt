 hurt as migrants broke through the fence and tried to board a train to the UK. Eurotunnel announced a further service suspension today after a second wave of migrants trying to break though security in the tunnel was thwarted.

The incident is just the latest to rock the Eurotunnel network in recent months. In August Eurotunnel began paying a Â£55m fine to the UK for not taking enough deportations of illegal migrants to the UK. A security scare at Calais in August led to a total suspension of rail services due to a diesel fire that left three people injured.

British Prime Minister David Cameron warned on Sunday that Britain would take action to tackle those arriving in Calais by sea from France despite assurances from French and Dutch officials that they will not be allowed to board British trains.

Eurotunnel boss John Keefe praised the "highly professional" work of French and EU border police who prevented the massive break in the security perimeter erected on Monday after a "high number of illegal migrants attempted to breach security and board passenger trains."

"The security work of Eurotunnel and its partners is second to none, and we would like to thank all of the French and European partners who worked extremely hard today to try to clear the site," he said.

On November 8 a group of migrants carrying weapons stormed the border fence separating the Eurotunnel site in Calais from the "Jungle" migrant camp, as the number of attempted border crossings by migrants climbed near to 2,000 per day.

There was a surge of new attempts earlier this month when the Jungle camp near Calais closed for the summer.

Earlier this week the new Eurotunnel Express train service from France to Britain was halted overnight so that security measures could be expanded.

The incident comes on top of a similar attempted break-in in September, which saw 300 migrants storm a Eurotunnel site, with one man seen kicking a security official while others tried to push his body in the chute.
