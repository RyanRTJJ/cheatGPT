After her victory, Colgan told Australian newspaper the Daily Telegraph: "My goal was to break the record of 18:50.

"For now, I want to continue with the sport, I just don't expect that in a year in a row or so."

Afterward, she was praised in a tweet from her Olympic website.

Colgan said race organisers had given her ample time and energy.

"[The race coordinator] said there's nothing I've got to lose, my legs are going to recover and they should be ready to race in a week's time," she said. "I am really, really happy."

Team GB took a 1-2-1 advantage.

Colgan went ahead by one minute when Abigail St Clair hit the ground. Colgan then crossed the line second ahead of her brother, who finished sixth.

Her sister Aly, 26, finished sixth after scoring 21 seconds faster than her.

It was the ninth consecutive time the Briton has won world time trial titles.

In 2006, she took second in the women's one hour, 12.41. In 2005, she took first and in 2004 she won the women's four-lap race in 9.46 minutes.

Colgan's team manager Tom Daley added: "We are delighted at what she achieved.

"The team worked tirelessly to put this together. It's remarkable - she did it in the exact same period, which I think most would do over the coming weeks."

Alicia Colgan, born 6 September 1960, has won the four worlds over the past nine years, including the men's 800m title in April 2003 and the men's 1500m title in December.

As the first female runner to reach five straight world time trials since Britain's Mary Rowland won the women's four-lap in 2004, it is an ambition that was matched only by her father, Bernard, a professional cyclist with the Bugey and Bongani Buses.

"I think she would still be our champion because of her pedigree," Bernard Colgan said. "It is amazing she has managed to do it
