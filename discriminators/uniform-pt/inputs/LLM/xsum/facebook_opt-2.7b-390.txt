It is a remarkable change of tack from the first time Davies, an economist and former chair of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, declared his intention to vote "to remain". And it will prove a tough vote for the Welsh Conservative.

A former Labour-supporting teacher who switched to the Conservatives in the 1990s because of Margaret Thatcher's liberal vision of the state, Davies became minister for education and training in David Cameron's government and a cabinet minister under Boris Johnson. He was the Welsh secretary until Mr Johnson became foreign secretary, before becoming Britain's last European commissioner.

But he quit cabinet after the referendum, citing Mr Johnson's decision to call a snap election. In a stinging denunciation of his erstwhile ally, Mr Davies declared the referendum "the worst political failure in the history of the United Kingdom" and "the most damaging and destructive of all the votes in the whole of the history of this country".

His decision to abstain in the EU referendum was made partly by concern about his party's stance, although he claimed the Tory manifesto had set out a positive message on the EU. But he also spoke out about his views about Brexit in a preamble to an opinion article in The Times last week.

But his decision to abstain in the forthcoming Welsh referendum remains enigmatic. To vote against the referendum, or abstain, on the grounds that he had already pledged his vote to remain, would undoubtedly rile Welsh Conservatives anxious about losing support in Wales. And to join other Conservatives in a vote of no confidence against Theresa May's government would alienate the prime minister.

Davies has always played the "credible alternative" card when challenged but this time, if we take him at his word, he appears not to have any credible alternatives at all. He will vote how he pleases. He may be a Tory MP, but only if Theresa May has a majority and they have to go to the country.
