This was the second death at a Newcastle home since 2012. In November 2014, three year-old Daphne Taylor died a month after being placed in a playpen by her mother, who locked her in. But this was the first reported death in the city in 15 years.

The death of five-year-old Mollie Dolan from Salford prompted an investigation. Her mother, Mary Anne Dolan, who was sentenced to 11 years in jail in 2013, was cleared of murder and manslaughter at a pre-sentence report.
