 you hear that...I just had so many emotions inside"

Former Scotland rugby captain Greig Laidlaw has revealed he is leaving his marriage to wife Anna and has been dating his former wife in recent months.

The Rugby World Cup winner, 40, was appointed as the Scottish Rugby Union boss last month, and spoke of his "new life" over the weekend.

Speaking after a recent match, he said his life was changing "unbelievably fast".

"I am leaving [Anna]. We got married in 2004, we've been together for 18 years. I've said it before, we're not going anywhere. We're still best of buddies. We're having a life together apart," he said.

He added: "I am finding myself a new life - a new family, new friends and working in the game I love so much. There is so much to look forward to."

Mr Laidlaw married his wife Anna, who he met in 1998, at Inverkip Parish Church on Saturday 29 July, 2004, and is survived by his wife and her son and daughter.

However, it appeared that marriage was "not long for this world" - "in a way" it was "a mistake".

"He knows the players and the players know him and he is a great role model for Scotland.

"He is a really good friend of mine as well and it's great to see him get
