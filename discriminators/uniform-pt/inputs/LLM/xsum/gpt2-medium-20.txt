 they receive severance payments.

The decision was criticised by the former president and party chief Jose Maria Aznar, who was a major backer of the plan.

He said: "I am deeply offended. We have worked hard in recent years to deliver clean, secure and renewable electricity sources to Portugal, and today I receive an extraordinary call to reject such a decision."

In a speech broadcast on RTP last night, Mr Aznar said they had also spent billions of euros in the country on new power generation over the past few years.

But he said that by failing to follow the lead set by the government Mr Aznar's views had been "misunderstood".

"I am convinced that the decision to abandon the project at the start of the year will cause grave misperceptions and damage investment and jobs throughout Europe," Mr Yax, said in his speech.

"This is already happening. New sources of energy and renewable electricity now have to wait several years until Europe starts to realise what they have really achieved in helping to save humanity, the planet and the environment."

However Mr Manuela Carmo said Mr Yax had also "fostered and increased opposition to renewables" when he was the governor of Goia da Gama.

Environmental groups and local businesses have slammed the plan including, Greenpeace, Greenpeace Portugal and the Environmentalist Association of Portugal (EAP).

Environmental group Greenpeace said the proposal would have a "decimating impact" on Portuguese society.

Greenpeace Portugal, which is seeking greater clarity over the proposed plan, said: "It's about time that the Lisbon government takes their time and considers the consequences."

"The government should focus instead on solving the problem of our burning waste, saving this planet-killing oil, with a better plan which doesn't involve turning Portugal into an energy desert without jobs, homes or electricity. That will help the environment all over the world. Otherwise, we will only be left with gas, and even then we are likely to stay
