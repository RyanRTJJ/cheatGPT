 delete those "in poor taste and should not be read out loudly by someone without a Twitter account".

In a tweet, the officer posted: "On day one @policegov will do whatever it takes to secure our digital infrastructure from cyber crime and terrorists."

A senior police officer said when approached by the Register, the officer said: "I take my job very seriously and the department is committed to the wellbeing, security and integrity of our people, including their Twitter accounts.

"As a result, our cyber team have taken action on a number of these offenders and we're also working with Twitter to identify and deal with further offenders. I'd like to say this is being taken really seriously by the police service."

The Facebook page of the public affairs officer for the cyber crime unit is unavailable at this time.


The Register reports that the police have already suspended two Twitter accounts it is suspected of using to monitor victims.

A police spokesman said: "Social media is a really powerful tool in terms of crime prevention and investigations. It's important to recognise that we have to balance the public's safety against the public's right to free speech."

It is legal to engage in the sale of firearms online if you are registered with the Firearms and Ammunition Licensing Agency, according to the Register. The site does not, however, state that if the sale of firearms is not permitted, weapons such as air guns and imitation firearms can be sold online.

The paper's report into the Twitter account holder states: "The complainant did not specify exact quantities of ammunition for sale to customers. That would probably have been the point."

The Register writes: "The Twitter account also shared messages from people claiming to have bought fake weapons from the account, but the account owner did not identify them as being from the account. These messages were quickly deleted."

A spokesperson for the police's force online said: "We are currently investigating a number of complaints relating to a number of people who have been posting on Twitter about firearms.

"We have already taken the appropriate action and suspended the offending user, and we are currently engaging with Twitter to look at further potential cases. We always review our procedures
