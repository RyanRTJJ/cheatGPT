 online version first.

It will be called 'A Course in the History of the Sciences', and was first teased at Merton University. The new course is expected to be launched next month.

It's not the first online course to be launched to teach students about history and it won't be the last - there are two main courses available currently - Cambridge's Master of Science in History at the University of Cambridge in the autumn and the Graduate School of the Arts at Leeds University in March.

Online courses have been a hit ever since they launched in 2008.

He is going after institutions with big budgeting challenges.

Khan Academy, formerly known as Coursera, offers short courses and exams for free, and offers a huge range of courses, including a course in music theory. It also offers a huge range of online courses, from coding to science.

Udacity has attracted a lot of attention in that it offers short courses for free. It has an app for smartphones that allows users to design, code and create websites, and many universities are experimenting with how best to use the app.

Khan Academy is now taking applications for an online course on the history of mathematics - an idea Thrun first pursued at Stanford, and now wants to expand on.

Professor Chris Rother, head of the history of maths department at Manchester Metropolitan University, is one example of someone who is using Khan Academy.

He is offering his students free access to its free online course 'The Maths of Nature'.

According to Rother, the
