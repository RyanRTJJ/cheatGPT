 the boy's story was a case of mistaken identity. The Greek Interior Ministry has arrested two other suspects in connection with the missing child.

"The situation is such that it is necessary that we are able to search for him through search parties and the local police," the deputy mayor, Dusanis Papelopoulos, said on Sunday.

"We have only been searching for him for several days. But now we would like everyone - for the first time in four years - to cooperate with law enforcement and with the authorities and put an end to the speculation about a missing child."

An investigation is under way into the disappearance and death of the boy in Athens. The Ministry of Justice launched an investigation earlier this year but said by early this week it was too early to consider whether the boy had actually been abducted.

Greek authorities had said in 2014 they had found a note in the boy's underwear to suggest the kidnapping was done out of malice.

He had been in Greece for five months with his younger sister and his parents having settled in Athens, according to an EU official who was not authorized to discuss the case. The official said the boy could be seen sleeping on a beach on the Greek island of Stavros on Saturday, and his friends had visited him about a month earlier.

In a statement on Sunday it said the boy had been kidnapped from the Greek islands of Kos and Greece by an unknown man, while at the same time being in custody in Turkey, since mid-last year.

It also said the boy had been living in Greece without his parents when the kidnapping happened.

The newspaper added that the boy's older sister, who was still on hold at the time of the abduction, wanted to get the police to come to an end but Greek authorities refused.

Greek authorities said the boy's mother was in Greece
