An indefinite shutdown has paralysed life in West Bengal, India's most industrialised tea state, and the main route into the Hills, leading to an increase in prices and shortages.

The Gorkha's Chief Minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, said the Gorkha League's call was aimed at splitting Darjeeling. "No one wants it [separation]. Why do these people want to do it? I
