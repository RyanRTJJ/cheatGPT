"Boeing is committed to resolving each of the issues and providing interim test flights before commercial operations begin," spokesman Peter Maley said.

In one of the changes brought about by the grounding of the Max jets, pilots will have to take certain routes - like the one that went down - and will be required to file a flight plan to avoid them.

The FAA does not plan to increase its number of 737 Max operators.

The regulator said the US operators will likely take a year to finish preparing their flights for the change, a "challenging" proposition given the industry's speed to respond to the new regulation.

The announcement comes on the same day that the FAA approved an Ethiopian Airlines jet that crashed a year ago.

It said there "remains a possibility that the cause of the accident will be found to have been a technical issue unrelated to the pilot's qualifications and experience, that is not covered by the requirements" of how much experience a pilot should have.

A number of airlines have grounded older Boeing jets from flying with their crews following the crashes.



A deadly crash of a MAX flight in Indonesia last October led to the grounding of its entire fleet. In March, regulators did not renew the certification of the aircraft's Max-10 model, causing the company to postpone deliveries of its most-sold jet by more than a year.



Since then, Boeing has added an automatic anti-stall system, a controversial software update, and the new MCAS system to improve the safety of the jet.

In April, Boeing reported that flight testing on the newly retrofitted aircraft "has been successful and the program continues to progress towards certification".

Two days before the Ethiopia crash, the FAA issued an advisory on how to avoid the routes flown by the Boeing 737 Max.

One flight operated by Lion Air and the other by Garuda Indonesia were in its "advisory zone".

The route used by the Indonesian flight was also one that
