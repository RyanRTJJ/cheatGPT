 apology from the city after he refused to give his daughter money.

Platt, who also claimed to be an attorney, received a new apology from council after he denied having given his daughter $10,000 in cash.

Platt claimed the City Council's decision not to grant his daughter money in April 2015 was necessary because of his "political and personal" involvement and claimed a "new apology" had "destroyed my ability to get past this".

In a statement, the city council noted "The council did not know of any previous problems concerning the council's decision to grant the daughter money."

Platt claimed it was the council's decision to give him money for making a "viable issue".

The council also found Platt, an attorney who also claims to be a Republican and was in court for last year's case, acted inappropriately with his daughter because he didn't share the same opinion as the father or the school board is more open to those who disagree with their child's views.

The letter is a letter Platt claimed never came from the council, his lawyer and "his wife â€“ I am not a lawyer," he said, adding that the council "was never in any way pressured by the council to allow my daughter money or otherwise to spend her time as I want her to."

Platt said his daughter has received $1.1 million and will receive more. "This is one more piece of evidence that supports my case for my daughter's right to go free for her freedom but is completely at odds with what has been said to protect her freedom of speech," he added.

District Judge Ian Gaffney declined to rule on the case, but said "one way to put this whole thing under review and be able to make a better informed decision is to try to establish why this happened.

"A reasonable person would conclude we would have asked for further information from the City of London in the form of the letter from the council and from the parents."
