 tourists and the rangers and authorities could no longer cope with them, a South African National Parks spokeswoman told AFP (AFP) news agency.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection, which oversees national parks, said that one ranger was killed in the incident.

A second ranger had fallen unconscious and was sent to hospital after suffering a heart attack, the spokeswoman also said.

Police and the park were called to the scene, which is about 100km (60 miles) from Johannesburg where another ranger was hit a few weeks ago.

The South African National Parks authority said that many foreign tourists and tour operators were visiting the parks, which attract about 14,000 visitors a year.

They were coming to see the wildlife, the parks spokeswoman said.


- 'Toxic' environment -


Environmentalists said they fear the incident in Mpumalanga could be "the tip of the iceberg" due to the growing number of tourists in the parks in the Kruger Peninsula.

Safa Kgosana, head of the Natural Assets Research Institute, said that "further incidents which threaten people" could prove to be "a precursor to a very serious environmental disaster... [which] will lead to serious consequences for all people living and working in Kruger's parks".

"Such incidents can cause environmental destruction if there is no action taken by visitors and the tourists themselves," Kgosana added, adding that tourists "are responsible for all actions at Kruger's parks."

The United Nations says the park is home to a range of endangered species, including the kudu, a bird found nowhere else on a continent bigger than Europe.

Some of the animals that live in the park's hinterland are threatened by logging and illegal killing, and the South African parks authority says it is working with the wildlife management communities to try to end it.

"I can't see any other explanation for why he killed the ranger then got out of the park and went home," local resident Joseph Kgosana
