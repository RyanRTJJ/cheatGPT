 in the locality after it escaped out of Beddgelert and was spotted at a park. It is believed to have since travelled in the other direction.

It has been called a "horrific spectacle", said Llanwch, adding that the local authority was struggling to prevent further fox-related incidents.

"This animal is dangerous," said Llanwrtydg. "We have had several recent incidents so we are seeing it regularly in the area. If they see it, they'll run to it, so there is risk to people that come in contact with it."

The Beddgelert Foxhound Association said it has had sightings of the animals in the area at least once a week for the past four years. A spokesman added that the association would continue to fight for a full ban on fox hunting, saying: "I hope the public are outraged and angry about this disgusting spectacle, which isn't even fit for the streets."

He added: "This is just another example of how our public's welfare and safety are being sacrificed to appease a small minority, and they can no longer be tolerated."

Llanwrtydg said: "We are trying to stop other fox hunts happening so that when there are more than five to seven foxhounds in one area, they are not able to roam free and a certain number of attacks occur."

It prompted South Wales Police chief constable Steve Ashman to criticise council chiefs for failing to adequately deal with the matter. He added: "We are in control of the situation, with all the necessary means at our disposal. Unfortunately this is not the case in many other areas of Wales where we receive reports of fox-related behaviour."

"I'm talking about incidents reported to us," he added.

Councillor Brian Wright, the local authority's deputy leader for safety, said the council was working with police as well as the RSPCA in the hunt on Monday.

"It's a case of trying to make sure that every event has a strong safety element and we are working with South Wales Police. We take these matters very seriously."
