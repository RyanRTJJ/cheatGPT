 the driver of the stolen car, which he had been chasing, had suddenly stopped. The police say that a shot was fired into the driver's side of the car before he reached and got inside his own car. The driver then drove off. When he stopped his car some time later near the Crumlin Road, the officer who had shot him opened fire. A second round of gunfire was required to kill him.

But some police union leaders claim the driver had already been apprehended and the officer had fired shots at his legs when he was in the back of the officer's car. A second officer on scene witnessed the exchange of shots and helped carry the now dead driver to hospital. The officer is not allowed to reveal his relationship to the driver. The policeman has been suspended from duty.

The RUC's Assistant Chief Constable Steve Corry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:

"It's obviously a dramatic sequence in one police officer shooting another in circumstances that are a little unclear. There was indeed a third officer on scene who was clearly called upon, there to render assistance if need be, who did make the call to firearms, that the suspect was dead.

"There was no further firing by anyone. We have suspended this officer. Our investigations, which are ongoing, will take their course. We can't afford in police inquiries to let public perception that a police officer has gone out to shoot a suspect on the streets of a city, in any sense of the word, put a policeman's life at risk and his family at even greater risk. It's just plain wrong."

A statement on behalf of the two officers released on Sunday night by the police union BCP (brotherhood and community police) said:

"No one wants to see any firearms deployed against the public or against another officer. When this happens police firearms teams, which are part of the RUC, are called to the scene. We are not privy to the details
