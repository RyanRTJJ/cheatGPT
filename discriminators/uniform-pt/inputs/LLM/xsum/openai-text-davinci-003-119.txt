 on BT Sport's Rugby Tonight, O'Connor did not rule out the possibility of extending his successful spell at the club.

"A two-year extension would certainly be interesting and it's something I'd have to consider," said the former Australia star.

"At this point in my career I want to continue playing and obviously there is a great team and club at Sale that I would love to be a part of.

"We'll see what happens, nothing is out of the question yet."

The form of O'Connor since joining Sale in 2013 has been impressive and the former Australia full-back has been a regular in their starting line-up.

He has been one of their most influential players, playing a major role in their march to the top four of the Premiership this season.

The 39-year-old could still be playing in the Sharks' colours in November 2016 and a potential two-year extension was discussed in detail during his appearance on BT Sport.

"I certainly have no plans to retire just yet," revealed O'Connor.

"I'm feeling in pretty good nick so I think I still have some good rugby left in me."

O'Connor has made 63 appearances for Sale, scoring 26 tries

The Irishman also admitted he still has a desire to win silverware with the Premiership club despite their recent struggles to win knockout trophies.

"I'm feeling very excited about the coming season and I want to be part of a side that can make a good run at the play-offs," added O'Connor.

"We were so close to winning silverware last season
