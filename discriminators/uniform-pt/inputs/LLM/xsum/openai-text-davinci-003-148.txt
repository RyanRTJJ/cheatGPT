the allegations are false, the best reaction from Ms Sturgeon is to fiercely deny them. Specifically, she could call the allegations a “complete and utter nonsense” or categorically assert that they “are entirely false”. She could then challenge the newspaper to provide evidence to back up the accusation or request a public retraction and apology. By immediately and firmly denying the claims, Ms Sturgeon sends a strong message to the public and the press that she will not tolerate false or misleading stories about her or her government.
