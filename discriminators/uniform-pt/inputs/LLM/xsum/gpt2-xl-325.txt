 warnings by mail.

The letter goes on to warn that "if you believe that a warning letter is unnecessarily restrictive and that you don't wish to receive these notices, you can take action to challenge the letters to your local human rights tribunal."

The law which prohibits companies refusing to employ certain groups or individuals doesn't exist, but it is backed by a coalition of trade unions. Unions argue that the practice is discriminatory and wrong, which could even lead to "racial segregation".

The government in 2011 decided to review the policy, because of objections from the media and businesses. The government set up an independent review group to look into the issue, which is due to release its final report early next year.

'Dangerously broad'

Earlier this week a campaign group that campaigns on gender inequality warned of "damning evidence" suggesting that "women are still unfairly discriminated against".

It said that in a "surprising range of cases, men and women have been refused entry into the labour market because of their gender".

The group - Stonewall's Women's Equality Network - highlighted a "dangerously broad definition" of sex discrimination, which was included in the government's review.

It added: "If the report is anything to go by then it might mean that many employees have received unfair notices for job applications they would not have been rejected under a different definition."

It called on ministers to publish specific criteria for applying for job applications or for taking part, and for the UK's employment law to ensure that it protects women.

The report is being unveiled on the 10th anniversary of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. At the time, Prime Minister Tony Blair promised it would "protect all of its citizens from sexual abuse, stalking and harassment".

The group also pointed out that discrimination against men is rife and a "sporadic but frequent occurrence".

Stonewall said that in 2011, one in four women aged 16 to 24 had faced some form of sexual harassment at work.
