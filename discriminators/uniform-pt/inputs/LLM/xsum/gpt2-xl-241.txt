-year-old woman and four children who had been inside the house at the time of the fire were taken to hospital.

Mr McMichael added: "That was the most serious fire in Glasgow I've seen in a very long time.

"Lendel house was in a notorious alleyway in Govan. The area is notorious because it's been the scene of many, many fires.

"The fire started under the eaves and a woman tried to put it out and there was extensive damage throughout â€“ all the floors were smoking. The ceiling collapsed completely.

"It started under somebody's roof and that's a bit scary, especially when you're inside. It took about two hours to bring the fire under control.

"There was extensive smoke damage throughout the house - the ceiling collapsed completely - but it was quickly brought under control.

"It's not known how much damage caused. It's a little bit frightening to think what's going on in the world."

Residents were warned not to alarm neighbours as smoke was still engulfing the area on Sunday night.

The fire service sent up a special crew to help battle the blaze from 11.30pm on Saturday until 7am on Sunday.

Sgt Stephen McVey, of Police Scotland's casualty bureau, said: "The fire service were called at 11.35pm on Saturday and as soon as they arrived it was obvious that there was a fire within the structure of the building.

"This was tackled by the fire service teams, there were no reports of casualties initially, but that has now been confirmed.

"We know that there were four children in the house and we are still in the process of looking into what happened to them, but at this stage it may be a little while."

He added: "Firefighters found that this fire was not caused by a gas leak, unfortunately."

Witnesses described how the fire tore through the property before moving onto the roof of it.

A man on Lendel Place in the Govan area said: "The fire came and went within seconds and then it was on to the roof."

A woman who was nearby said: "I heard a crack, I went outside
