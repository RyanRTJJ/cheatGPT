 failed to turn up at home, and now they have released an urgent appeal to trace him

The body of missing Hampshire man Edward Davies could be in the Lochaber region, police have said.

Mr Davies, 39, from Southdown, Hampshire, has not been seen since Sunday 8 May and police believe he was in the Glencoe area.

A police search of the area has failed to locate the missing man and officers have now released an urgent appeal to trace him.

The Missing Persons Unit said Mr Davies was last seen in the Glencoe area on Sunday 8 May at around 6.30am.

During the investigation of the area, police came across the River Coquet on Monday 9 May by way of Glencoe Bridge on the Scottish Highland road.

The disappearance of Mr Davies, who has only been missing since last week, prompted a major search by police throughout the day and into the night.

However, a search of the area by the Coastguard team on Tuesday 9 May, and another carried out yesterday, has been unable to locate Edward and his family are becoming increasingly worried for his welfare.

The Missing Persons Unit said the family of Mr Davies was of concern and was offering a cash reward of Â£1,000 for any information leading to his safe return, and were urging anyone who knows any information to contact them.

A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Police in Scotland are appealing for the public's help in tracing missing 39-year-old Edward Davies who has concerns for his welfare.
