The government says it has to do more to help young people facing serious mental health problems. It says it looks after "the most vulnerable children across the country in safe and supportive care".

Its report, "The Care, Support and Social Development of the Young Most in Need", said: "There is a need for more professional, early-stage treatment for young people whose illness is complex and challenging, but who do not fit neatly into the traditional view of the young most in need.

"There's a growing call for a special role for the very young. There are also growing calls for more and better prevention and early intervention services to combat the problems facing young people who show up to care."

The Department for Education plans to give free care in two special education centres in London for young people with mental health problems to help reduce their vulnerability to suicide and drug problems later on in life.

A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: "DfE has recently identified areas of need in which young people with mental health problems may be vulnerable to the impact of poverty, violence or social exclusion: for example, in schools, by age, or by race. We offer these special education services free to address these issues.

"The DfE runs care at both special education and primary schools. The key difference is that parents are responsible for the carers. Parents are provided with information and advice on helping their child with a specific mental health problem, and can make arrangements for their child to meet with a carer. At those levels, our advice works best.

"However, we also want parents to make sure they can support their children. A young person from a carer has the best chance of escaping their problem â€“ if they go to the carer in the first place."

The Guardian is investigating the issue of care for so-called "special needs" children as part of our report, The Caregiver's War on Youth. Here is an extract from our special report, "A special education teacher who can't take action on her daughter: The story of a child's mental
