How he was selected: A player of great pedigree and a promising young player.

After taking over a side that lost their way after being promoted to the Premier League, the former England Under-19 team-mate will be looking to follow up that form at Watford.

His arrival will be welcomed by the Hornets, who are searching for answers at goalkeeper following the departures of Gianluca Festa, Jack Blake and Andy Keogh, and hope that he will help provide competition for the likes of Simon Francis, Harry Maguire, John Sutton and Jonathan Kodjia.

Murray was also one of the players whose name was put forward when Liverpool made one of their major signings as part of their Â£20.1m bid for Dejan Lovren from Southampton in August.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who brought on the 24-year-old for the Europa League opener, gave Murray the opportunity to demonstrate his credentials when they took him on to the training pitch in their Liverpool area just after the window was shut.

He made his senior debut for England Under-19s last November but was not called into his first senior squad until January as Rodgers tried to build his squad for this summer's European Championships in France.
