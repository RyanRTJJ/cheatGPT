 they have just enough questions to ruffle some feathers.

The theory behind Ricciardo's performance is that he is a very quick driver but just made a huge mistake on track at the French race which meant he couldn't complete his programme.

Rivals suggest that this is what happened and it means that the team will have to work hard to ensure that Ricciardo never suffers a repeat of his error.

Mercedes are still not fully convinced that Ricciardo can be relied upon to do his job, although the Australian's victory in qualifying for the next round in Monaco should give him the team confidence.

It was a different story for Hamilton, who made his first appearance in the Mercedes AMG in a qualifying session for 14 years and showed the car's potential.

With Mercedes struggling with the aerodynamic characteristics of their car, Hamilton used the opportunity to drive the car in a "dry" day, at a time of the day when he is expected to do the most laps to maximise the performance.

But for all the confidence that Mercedes have, there is also the problem of the reliability which has caused such a strain on their rivals this year.

There are issues with the car, mainly concerning its engine, and if Mercedes cannot fix those this season then they may be vulnerable.

Ferrari, McLaren, Red Bull, Force India and Williams all have problems. Those teams would have been looking forward to being able to see the Ferrari and Red Bull cars in a qualifying session for the first time this year, but instead they will have to watch from the side line as the rest go out on track.

"The gap is huge, the gap between us and Mercedes," said Fernando Alonso after finishing seventh in Monaco.

As usual, Alonso is pointing to the reliability, something which has also plagued the whole of Formula One this year, as a key factor behind his disappointing results in the last few races.

He added: "There is no margin for error and in the last few races, I was able to come eighth in Singapore but even a small error
