's representative in July from David Johnston, who announced earlier this month that he will retire after 12 years as governor general of Canada. His replacement is to be announced in the next few months, while the appointment process for Mr Johnston's successor has been delayed indefinitely. "I couldn't be more pleased to add to my life's experiences with this role and for the many years ahead," Ms Payette told reporters, adding: "I am inspired by the extraordinary people I work with every day, Canadians in every corner of our country, and the opportunity to do things I never dreamed I would. "Governor-General has been an important source of wisdom, integrity, and compassion for our country through some of our most difficult times." Ms Payette was born in Quebec City in 1965, then a part of federal Canada but now a province of the Quebec nation - although she has lived in the United States for much of her adult life. She was part of a small team that worked on the Canadian entry into a common market before, in the final years of the Harper government, the final agreement signed in the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. She was also the first woman to head an engineering company in Canada, and a chief executive officer at one of the country's largest manufacturers. She graduated from Harvard Business School in 1992 and became chief executive of engineering group L3Harris Technologies in 2007, overseeing nearly 30,000 employees.
