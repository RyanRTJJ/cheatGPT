 decision on whether a ban on the trade union bill should go ahead would only be made after the decision, he said.

"Trade unions are fundamental to any society and cannot be allowed to be forced from the people or denied the opportunity to be vocal on matters which are of concern to the majority of society."

The decision to oppose the Labor government's plans for a ban on the National Employment Service (Nesco) came from the NSW Greens on the crossbenches.

"The Greens are opposed to the bill and want to ensure that NSW continues to have a positive influence on the national political agenda and that the Nesco bill does not become a distraction from the ongoing national debates and the importance of reform," the Greens senators, Laurie Ferguson and Rachel Siewert, said in a statement.

The Nesco bill was introduced to parliament last year. It was a bipartisan piece of legislation that aimed to create a new agency devoted to helping young people to enter or stay in the workforce. The legislation introduced Nesco with bipartisan support from all four parties in the assembly.

The bill was criticised by the NSW branch of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which called Nesco "an attack" on the union movement.

Mr Andrews said the Labor party had not introduced or supported any of the government's anti-union laws.

"It's wrong for the Labor Party to do this, but it does show they have a position that they were elected on," he said.

"We think it's important that people have the right of freedom of association. If all parties joined together we could deal with the bill as it is without getting into all the other issues."

Ahead of the vote, the state branch of the Australian Council of Trade Unions called for an investigation by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Constitution.

On Tuesday, the committee will consider whether legislation to ban the trade union bill could become law.
