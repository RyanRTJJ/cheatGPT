Since a 2013 Supreme Court ruling allowing a Virginia law for same-sex marriage was struck down in July, anti-LGBTQ activists have sued five states, including South Carolina, arguing that their bans violate federal laws requiring equal rights under the law.

Lawmakers, and courts in at least three states, have also turned down same-sex marriage bans.

Brent Bozell, a spokesman for Equality North Carolina Campaign, called the case, which centers on how the state handles discrimination, "the latest example in our fight for constitutional equality for all our people."

While a new judge in Texas has not yet ruled on the case, state officials have said the state cannot issue ID cards to same-sex couples unless a marriage license is obtained from another state, and that gay marriage in Texas will not be legal until all states recognize same-sex marriages conducted elsewhere.

In North Carolina in 2012, North Carolina voters approved a marriage law that required people to show government-issued photo identification when visiting a public restroom on their way to their place of business. The law also restricted access to restrooms by imposing a $100 civil fine on businesses with more than two restrooms.

North Carolina lawmakers this summer passed a law eliminating some federal protections for gays and lesbians and mandating that gay and transgender people use public bathrooms corresponding with the sex registered on their birth certificates.

But last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, in its July ruling on state laws banning same-sex marriage, invalidated nearly all of the state's law banning similar discrimination.

Bozell said advocates did not want judges to rule on the case before the U.S. Supreme Court issues a ruling.

"After today's decision, this action will not impact pending cases or appeals filed in court," Bozell wrote in a statement
