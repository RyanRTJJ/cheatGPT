 from the UK Government to David Ford - the UK Secretary of State in Northern Ireland - which outlined ways in which the Treasury could work with the Executive in the wake of the UK government's recent announcement that it intends to transfer power away from Stormont.

Mr Robinson also said there was a "dramatic level of concern" expressed in a phone call with the British Prime Minister's private office and to Foreign Secretary William Hague, regarding the situation at Stormont.

The First Minister said the two parties have discussed the matter further, but no resolution was forthcoming.

He said: "Although it remains clear that, absent some kind of change, there is an expectation of at least a significant deterioration of the situation in the coming weeks, the parties are still committed to finding ways forward to a resolution."

Mr Robinson said the First and Deputy First Ministers are going to speak to their EU counterparts as well as the Democratic Unionist Party, before announcing any details of the planned protest on Saturday.

In a statement he said: “The First and Deputy First Ministers agree that Northern Ireland currently faces a crisis.

“But, while they remain committed to working with the British and wider Irish governments to find a way forward, they are equally determined to press ahead with whatever they need to hold a major protest demonstration in the Republic of Ireland on Saturday to force a change in the political direction of the British and Irish governments and the North.

“The First and Deputy First Ministers have spoken to their EU counterparts who are still sympathetic to the protest.

“They are to engage with the DUP now before revealing any details to the public to allay any fears among Unionists as well as nationalists about the intention of the protest.”

The First and Deputy First Ministers intend to confirm the timing of the protest and details of participants
