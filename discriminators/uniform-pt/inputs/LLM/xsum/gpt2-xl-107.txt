 not believe that would be possible.

In 2012 Abbott had also said he would hold a plebiscite if the Coalition lost government in 2016.

"We would be calling a people's vote and we would ask all Australians if they think Australians should have a say on this issue rather than a plebiscite," he had said.


He was asked by Channel Seven whether Australian people should have the choice of a plebiscite or electing lawmakers to legislate on the issue.


"For sure there will be a choice provided by this plebiscite but it is a choice within the Parliament," he said.


"Let me be very clear - it is not a choice between the plebiscite option or a parliament's option. It is a choice about a public vote."

Abbott then said a parliamentary vote was an option.

"There is another way of being able to decide this - if elections were held - but the Australian people would decide this issue, with a plebiscite," he said.


Labor's Senate leader Penny Wong described Australian citizenship laws as draconian and said she could not support another plebiscite.


"They are draconian and designed to do nothing other than ensure that you vote against your own best interest," she said.

Labor's citizenship spokesman Richard Marles was also quizzed on whether he backed a plebiscite.

"What I will be doing is working with the Greens and others on cross-party legislation to reform the citizenship laws," he said.

"The Turnbull government will not be pushing for a plebiscite on this issue. In contrast to the Labor opposition, the Coalition does not believe it is appropriate to have a plebiscite," the spokesman said.

The spokesman said the Turnbull government had no plans to repeal the citizenship act but would have a detailed look at the proposed amendments to it.


The spokesman said the government "will continue to support the long-existing system, which enables Australians to hold public office
