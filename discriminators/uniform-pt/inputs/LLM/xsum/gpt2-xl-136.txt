 while the labour force participation in June fell to a new record low level of 63.5%.

In the June quarter GDP grew by 0.6% qoq compared with the same quarter of last year. Net exports, however, grew by only 0.1%, which is also the smallest since the May-July quarters of last year.

"The contraction in the industrial activity has been much sharper than expected. This is quite worrying, especially since industrial production accounts for 80 percent of the GDP in this area. The first rate cut in Q1 is now well underway," said economist László Andor.

The National Statistics Office pointed out that a slowdown in non-trading-sector activities, namely the retail and rental- and leasing-sector, is expected to have an upward impact on GDP in Q3.

"The sector is expected to contract by 0.4% yoy compared with Q1. The sector's rate of growth had been accelerating in the first three quarters of the year and it appeared to have levelled out in Q2," said senior economist Álvaro Galán.

The sector of wholesale and retail trade accounts for the growth of economic activity in Q4, with the latter, however, expected to contract by 0.4% yoy compared with Q3.

The sector's main reason for slowing growth was the reduction in exports. The sector's exports were $3.7 billion, or 15.6% of GDP, in Q3, which was 2.3 times lower, than its $9.5 billion, or 45.7%, of GDP, in Q2.

The fall was led by a 0.2% drop in shipments of motor vehicles and engines. The country's trade surplus in motor vehicles and engines reached a new record level of $1 billion.

The growth in retail, wholesaling and leasing of goods, and the services sector, have offset the downturn in trade and production. The services sector increased 1.2% in Q4, but by 0.4% yoy compared with Q3. The services sector has also contributed 1.8% to the year-on-year increase in GDP growth this year.
