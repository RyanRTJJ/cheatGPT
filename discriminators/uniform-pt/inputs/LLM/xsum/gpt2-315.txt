 Lib Dems, Labour's rival, for the party's poor performance in the general election and described it as an "unprecedented failure".

"It is clear that Labour and the Tories have lost every single poll since 2005," he continued, adding: "It is a defeat for the party that is not a surprise but the defeat caused by Labour and the Tories not engaging in honest debate amongst themselves.

"That is what gives the Tories their power and that is why they are in trouble."

But Mr Watson added: "There are some people who are asking about how we are going to deal with those that are being thrown under the bus and also about why he should accept that he is going to win."

Asked about his recent performance, Mr Watson said: "I think it is going to be a very difficult campaign and a very expensive campaign for the party and the Tories."

Speaking at a media conference this afternoon in London, Mr Watson said: "In Britain we must look to what has happened under the Corbyn regime and we expect that the Labour leader and the Lib Dems continue to show his ability to hold public opinion accountable to him and to show that a different tone of politics should govern our party and we should not leave them hanging."

He added: "We want us not to see any more 'unprecedented failure'," while insisting "there is no alternative", adding: "We believe that there are good options for people to have the voices and make their own decisions.

"We don't want their voices being heard either when a Jeremy Corbyn government is called but rather when it goes against the interests of a Labour Government and the interests of the Working Families Party and where Corbyn's government is doing all it can to lead a real change."

The Labour leader said he would not accept a "unprecedented failure" by his party with
