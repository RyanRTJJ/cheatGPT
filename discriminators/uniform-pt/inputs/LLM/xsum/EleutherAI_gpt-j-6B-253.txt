 green light, claiming the site wasn’t suitable because of its groundwater. But in a landmark judgement last month, a judge overturned the council's planning decision and ruled that shale gas was not causing an unacceptable environmental impact in the area.

The ruling may herald a new era of shale gas. Campaign groups say they have seen more energy firms seeking permission to explore for the controversial gas.

"I think companies are now being more confident about the environmental impact that they can carry out - if they think they are going to get away with it so to speak," says Jonathan Isaby, head of policy for energy campaigner Friends of the Earth. He adds that more than 40 sites in the UK have been given the go-ahead. Of those, 15 have now been given the seal of approval.

The industry claims the industry has already spent £2.2bn researching shale as a new potential source of gas. The vast majority of this research is privately funded.

But the impact on the environment, the impact on water, the extent of its impact on climate change and the level of pollution as emissions are released are major concerns.

According to a Friends of the Earth report, the UK is producing enough shale gas to power the entire country, but it is trapped in wells close to the top soil. The gas then leaks. Around 4% of gas extracted from shale is produced as biogas. This can be used as a source of energy, but it is difficult to separate and so contains high levels of methane and other pollutants.

In July, the shale-extraction technology company Ineos became the second UK company to begin commercial extraction of shale gas at its site near Kirby Misperton, using a low-temperature extraction process. Drilling started in June after Ineos was granted permission by North Yorkshire Council and the European Commission. Three wells were subsequently drilled: two producing gas and a third well with methane - a byproduct of the process that is difficult to separate.

Critics of the industry argue the drilling - which requires the land being cut up to 3,000 feet - involves the building of what is effectively a big coal mine, with its associated effects on the environment, land
