It is reported that in Carmarthenshire, in West Wales, 4,500 social housing properties have been upgraded by Carmarthenshire County Council (CFC) and will be subject to rigorous checks from early 2010. Tenants in homes with boilers, fridges or water heaters, and others with “more energy inefficient” features, have been given a year to make the necessary changes.

Eileen Gleeson is quoted as saying: “This represents one of a number of important studies which we have to undertake in Wales – this is an important step because the health benefits of moving away from coal and gas to electricity and biomass are significant and well established.

“So, in the study, we’re looking at whether improvements, or if improvements have occurred, which impacts people’s health. For instance, if there were a significant reduction in asthma in a neighbourhood perhaps there would be a health benefit in that area.”

The study, funded with £300,000, is being run by the Wales Epidemiology Unit and is due to start in early 2010. It is being monitored by the West Clinical Research Facility at the University of Wales, Cardiff. The report is expected to be completed in 2014 and could lead to the benefits of the local initiative being rolled out to a wider area.

The Carmarthenshire Housing Association has announced that it will begin to switch all of its customers to pre-payment meters from April 1st 2009 to enable them to be billed and their accounts settled at the start of the month.

The switchover will affect about 4,500 housing association homes where, from the 1st April, water and gas users will be able to pay their monthly charges to a central bank account.

The first tenants – all of whom pay their annual rents via their landlord – will move to pre-payment meters from April 1st 2010.

The move is all part of the Housing Associtons plan to become debt-free by 2013.
