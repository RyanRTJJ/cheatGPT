ton have decided to proceed with devolution. Devolution is a significant part of decentralising power and decision-making while allowing local councillors to ‘make a difference’ in their respective areas.

Devolution also allows the combined authorities to take decisions on specific policies and programmes, particularly in the areas of transport, housing and economic development. This could include creating special economic zones, developing transport infrastructure, changing planning regulations and creating new ways of financing housing.

The combined authority can also act as a ‘bargaining chip’ for the areas within it by enabling a merger of resources and decision-making, which could help drive inward investment, create jobs and support people in the region.

The main benefits of devolution for St Helens and Sefton are increased autonomy and increased ability to bring about local change. This can be done by reducing red-tape, improving services and making decisions that are tailored to the local population. Devolution also grants the combined authorities enhanced fiscal powers, meaning that funding now comes directly to the local council rather than having to apply through central government. This can result in better resource planning, faster decision-making and closer collaboration with external partners.

In addition to controlling its own resources, devolution also encourages better governance and accountability amongst the combined authorities. The overt involvement of elected councillors and an increased level of scrutiny over decision-making allows the governing body to respond swiftly to local needs and also makes it easier to identify and address any grievances.
