 he said, adding that his comments about Romney are "being repeated."

Republicans should push forward through their 2018 midterms this year in order for the party to win more states. But Republicans must also recognize that when people give honest and open-minded and non-deceptive comments — like Romney's during his interview — they may have hurt the party's nominee. As an example, Rep. Tom Cole (R-N.C.), the speaker of the New York House who said he wanted President Obama to be impeached, called Romney, in a 2012 CNN interview, an "unbelievably dishonest liar." After Cole posted comments criticizing Romney on Twitter, Obama said on "Meet the Press" that "Romney's comments, whether they were sincere or not, are evidence that you're not a serious person who can fight big government with a single fist."

Many Republicans in Congress have voiced skepticism about Romney's honesty. The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza asked House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, D-Calif., about the comments in a series of interviews last month, which are still unclear to the president, but the former Massachusetts governor, who is widely expected to leave the House, said he felt the comments were evidence that he did not believe Romney's own remarks. "That's something a lot of people have heard before, but they're very clear that there were some serious things he said," McCarthy told the Post. "But they're not about his honesty. They're just about his statements."

Asked to comment on whether he believed Romney's comments, McCarthy replied, "I have been very clear on that. I don't know." He continued: "I think it's a very personal issue, and I never said that as a speaker. I've said these kind of things about people all along. In that kind of personal, personal sense, I don't have the same judgment on anything that goes on in politics. The question of whether or not they had the proper judgment, that's an open question.
