 1,500 years ago.

An anthropologist was commissioned to investigate the man's age.

The university said he could "certainly date to the early fourth century" and was found in a group of bones, probably belonging to another individual.

The skeleton had a long, slender leg and was dressed in a brown tunic and breeches. His arms appear to have been "loose" and there was no sign of a crown of hair, the university said.

Scientists found evidence for a "very severe head wound" with a large hole and also evidence of a blow to the head which had left a large wound. All signs were consistent with a blow to the head, the university said.

The skeleton had broken right thumb and may have suffered back or spinal damage.

Analysis of the man's teeth indicates he had not consumed "a large quantity of red meat" and may have been a "hardworking and productive individual" with "a good knowledge of the agricultural system".

Some bones were in poor condition showing the man had died "from a severe fall" at the time of his death.

"Given his age, we can only speculate that he suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease," according to an abstract of the study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

The man did not have any osteoporosis or evidence of injury to bones, suggesting he was likely young when he died, the study said.

The archaeologist who carried out the excavations and was the principal investigator, Professor David Wilkinson, said that although the man did appear to have suffered "a long and severe fall" it may have occurred in London.

"He is found with his clothes on, but there are no signs of him wearing metal or silver equipment, indicating that he was probably a member of a London community who spent his spare time in the city," he said.
