 the extent to which the oil pollutes.

A Greenpeace ship is to sail into the Shetland Islands to lay a symbolic flag on the grounded British Petroleum-owned oil tanker. The Norwegian group Greenpeace plans to drop a flag bearing a red, green and black triangle - a symbol of opposition to British Petroleum - on the grounded oil tanker Golden Ray on Sunday (8 January). The ship ran aground off the Shetland Islands on 5 January, 1993, spilling almost 85,000 tonnes of crude oil. Many birds died but the weather limited the extent to which the oil pollutes. After the Golden Ray hit rocks, the oil began to leak from the vessel, and the leaking oil is now contained to a small area of about 120 square metres. Greenpeace will place its symbolic flag on the Golden Ray on Sunday, the group's spokesman in Norway told Reuters. The flag is expected to stay on the tanker for three days before dropping back to sea. The flag will then be taken up by Greenpeace activists in a ship that will make the journey to the port of Murmansk, the Norwegian group said. Golden Ray is owned jointly by British Petroleum's Unocal subsidiary and Japan's Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and was grounded during high tide on 5 January, while it was carrying about 85,000 tonnes of crude off the Shetland Isles. The spill, at a depth of about eight metres, fouled a 50-kilometre stretch of coastline in the Shetland and Orkney islands. Most of the oil had escaped before a ship called the MV Spirit of Norway pulled it off the rocks. The spilled oil from the Golden Ray did not cause as much damage as the oil spill of 1989 which hit the West Cape and the north coast of Scotland and killed millions of birds. But it left a "heavily contaminated and heavily eroded" coastline, according to Norwegian Environment Agency. (D)

In 1991 a Greenpeace ship named Rainbow Warrior ran aground in Thailand. A large amount of fuel spilled off the ship. The ship was towed out of the water by a Thai tugboat. Greenpeace plans to lay a symbolic flag on the grounded British
