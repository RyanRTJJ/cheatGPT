Bills advancing in several other Republican-controlled states would also ban LGBTQ-inclusive discrimination as part of bills that also target transgender youth.

The Supreme Court’s decision was a victory for transgender rights advocates, who had long warned that such ordinances represent a civil rights violation, CNN said, citing Lambda Legal, a civil rights group.

The court ruled 5-to-4 that the constitutional right to privacy was incorporated over LGBT protections, the news channel said. The decision did not take into account a lawsuit from a transgender employee who challenged his employer's treatment, CNN said.

In a dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts noted that the decision could have important consequences for other workers, including those in the medical industry.

The justices who dissented also said the majority has erred in interpreting the term "sex," according to CNN.

The justices also agreed with the majority that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is no longer relevant to protections for transgender people. The landmark law bars companies from discriminating on the basis of sex including gender identity.

But Roberts said that the majority "fails to grasp the logical extension of this holding” because sexual harassment laws would no longer apply to transgender individuals.
