ithout actually being a work by the Dutch Master. The computer model was used to create a completely new artwork, which was then painted by a professional painter. This painting has a realistic style that is reminiscent of Rembrandt's works, but with a modern flair. The painting has light and dark tones, and a brushstroke that is similar to Rembrandt's works. The details are carefully rendered, and the background has a smoky, shadowy feel. Overall, the painting looks very much like a true Rembrandt, although it was created by a computer and painted by a human.
