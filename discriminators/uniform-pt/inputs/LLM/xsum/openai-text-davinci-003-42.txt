 be aware of the consequences of their children's poor diet and lack of exercise, with an emphasis on the importance of organic and healthy foods.

She also warned that “a culture of overconsumption” was leading to health problems and impacting people’s ability to work and lead fulfilling lives, emphasising that “children and young people are being put at greater risk of long-term disease due to poor diet and physical inactivity.”

In addition to this, Davies pointed out that despite improvements in the detection and treatment of cancer, disparities in cancer survival still exist between different parts of the country. She voiced her commitment to improving cancer outcomes for those living in deprived areas, enabling them to access the same level of care and outcomes as those living in more affluent parts of the country.

Davies also expressed concern over the lack of access to public health services such as free stop smoking services and Healthy Start vitamins, as well as the decline in funding for local authorities. She stressed the importance of investment in public health, stating that prevention measures would save the NHS money in the long run.

In conclusion, Davies highlighted the importance of taking a holistic approach to healthcare, looking at the wider determinants of health such as education, housing and the environment. In order to reduce healthcare inequalities, she suggested there should be more research into the social and economic impact of illness and health-related behaviours, and urged policy makers to consider the long-term implications of under-investment in public health.
