History

Desertmartin Presbyterian Church was founded in the 19th century and is believed to have been established from a meeting house opened by the Rev. J.B.C. MacCabe, Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, who was rector of the Church of Ireland Parish St. Anne's. MacCabe visited Desertmartin Presbyterian Church at least twice. The Presbyterian church on Clonmel's Main Road was closed in the 1840s.

The church was closed in 1913, during the Riots in Ireland, and was then used by the British Army before being taken over by the Roman Catholic Church in 1914. The Presbyterian church re-opened as a Roman Catholic church in 1931. Desertmartin Presbyterian Church was affiliated to the Presbyterian Synod of Ireland.

The Church of Ireland Parish Board (which is in turn associated with the Northern Ireland Presbytery and the Ulster Presbytery of  the Presbyterian Churches of Ireland) took ownership of the Church of Ireland Parish of Desertmartin, Clonmel, Co. Tipperary, Northern Ireland in 1846. Since 1 January 1920 there were four Presbyterian Churches in Ireland - the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church of Ireland, the Free Presbyterian Church and the United Presbyterian Churches. The Presbyterian Church of Ireland did not have a congregation in Ireland before the 19th century. However the first meeting house was opened in 1794 by the Rev. John MacCabe, a minister who served the Church of Ireland (in this case, the Church of Ireland of Waterford, Ennistymon & South East Clare) as rector until April 1842.

The Presbyterian Church in Ireland had no congregations in South Tipperary or
