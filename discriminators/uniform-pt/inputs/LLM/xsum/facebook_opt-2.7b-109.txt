 a jail safely.

Mr Shapps had already written to the chief inspector of prisons on 4 February asking him to keep a “very close” eye on the situation, and on Wednesday the Department for Transport published the inspector’s report, telling the public: “It is our belief that the prison’s current situation is unsustainable.”

He said HM Inspectorate of Prisons had visited the prison and had “agreed on a number of issues and suggested solutions”.

A DfT spokeswoman said: “[Mr Wrigglesworth] said he is sorry that people are being hurt in Exeter, which he said is unacceptable.”

The spokesman added: “The prison is working to reduce staff shortages and improve the safety of staff and inmates. Last year, HM Inspectorate of Prisons inspected the facility and confirmed a high number of violent incidents. We have instructed our inspector to look again at the prison.”

Mr Wrigglesworth responded to the report on his personal website, saying he accepted there was a “high volume of incidents” but that there was a “robust” security operation in place to make the jail safe for staff and prisoners.

He added there were “significantly fewer incidents” since the prison was handed over to the private sector under the controversial private sector probation service in March 2017.

The jail was one of 11 private prisons handed over to G4S and was run by Serco until 31 July 2018.

A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Staff safety is the top priority and is our first priority. This is why there is no single strategy for tackling violence in jails. This is one of a number of tools we are using.

"We have made huge investments in funding and technology to improve our detection and prevention of violent crime… We can’t tackle the root causes of violence without effective training and our investment in the next phase of the government’s prisoner rehabilitation programme is already helping to change the lives of young offenders.”
