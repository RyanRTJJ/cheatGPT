 to end the "wasteful and damaging" sale of homes, schools and hospitals. Mr Brown will say: "Too often, these public service agencies are sold off to the highest bidder. This is why British councils and parliaments should have similar powers to cities across Europe. "No one, whether public or private, can claim immunity from scrutiny and accountability." The Prime Minister announced plans of a public-private-partnership (PPP) for the railways at the May Budget. The PPP was included in the Tory election manifesto and has been championed by Mr Brown. The Tories have argued that private firms will end waste and boost efficiency. But the plans were attacked in a report by Labour MP Alan Williams that was due to be published soon. Mr Brown will attack it as a political fudge. "Labour will fight against the sale of public services and will scrap the PPP as it has come to be," he will say. The speech marks Mr Brown's attempt to use the forthcoming Labour conference in the east Midlands to consolidate his position before the next election. He is also set to address a summit of G20 nations over the weekend. It follows a summit of 15 leaders of industrialised countries at the US state of California. 'Wasteful, damaging' Earlier this month, Mr Brown launched a consultation on proposed changes to planning laws. He said the Government wanted to change the law to end local planning authorities' power to block major development projects after 15 years. He said: "In the past, there has been a fear that if there is an economic downturn and a project goes ahead that local planning objections are too much to take, and they are not allowed to go ahead. He added that Britain faced an "ever-changing world" and planning "had to adapt to meet the challenges that lie ahead". Mr Brown's announcement in California followed one by President Clinton, at the World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, which gave women from poor countries basic rights
