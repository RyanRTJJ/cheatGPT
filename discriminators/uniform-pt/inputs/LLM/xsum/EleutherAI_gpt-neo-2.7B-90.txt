 to be “refuelled”.

He added that the 1.6L is the most fuel-efficient in terms of both performance and range, with the 2L being almost twice as powerful.

The 1.6L will have an ARAI standard Euro 6 emissions certification at a level of 125g/kWh.

However, it will cost £750 per vehicle on-road, while the larger 2L is £1,500.

On top of the higher prices, the government is also looking to change national fuel standards, which have historically been more stringent than European Union requirements.

According to the latest projections, new vehicles in the UK will emit 40.8g/kWh in 2020, which is 14g/kWh less than what is achievable under EU standards.

The government also wants to phase out harmful emissions and has set a date of 2022 for this to happen, a move which will see the UK fall to the EU’s third position.

However, Mr Willis said that as the government is now seeking to remove harmful emissions, the government needs to make sure that there is “a level playing field” so those in the business of the auto industry don’t see a reduction in car sales.

He told the BBC: “So if everyone is cutting emissions then there are going to be winners and losers.

“And the losers are the millions of families who are working hard and earning a decent income from working in these sectors.”

The government was previously considering the idea of replacing gas and electricity with a national mix of renewable energy, with plans to invest £5bn in wind and solar power stations across the country by 2020.

However, this announcement may have been put on hold in order to give the industry time to make the necessary changes on diesel engines, a decision which comes following a consultation launched last Thursday.

“They’re looking at the long term and the potential of the 1.6 engine and making sure that we have a level playing field,” Mr Willis told the BBC, adding that “we have to make sure that those running the show at the moment can continue doing that.”
