A new campaign run by the Association of Chief Police Officers looks at getting roundabouts right and a survey commissioned by the charity Sustrans also found that many drivers do not like them either.

The ACPO's Safer Roads campaign has said a study is required to see the impact motorway and motorway off-ramps have on pedestrian and cyclist safety.

They said that new research shows pedestrian and cyclist behaviour at junctions is still largely unpredictable, and the vast majority (83%) of accidents that result in injuries are caused by human factors, such as dangerous driving.

"The Highway Code only requires drivers to make overtaking changes only when coming into a roundabout," the association said.

"We can see that drivers don't understand this guidance.

"We know traffic management rules are not enough and drivers are still turning without giving way at busy junctions.

"We need the government to take more active steps to make motorists understand and adhere to the Highway Code."

The charity Sustrans said drivers are at risk of "fatalistic paralysis" when they think the roundabout is a simple, simple junction that can be reached from the road they are travelling on.

"To reduce the risk of collision, junctions need to be designed to be as safe as possible for all pedestrians and cyclists, in line with the Highway Code," said the Sustrans director for cycling, Emma Harper.

Cyclists can also make themselves less vulnerable, according to the ACPO.

"Use reflectives on your bike, wear high-visibility clothing and cycle at night and at all times of the day when possible," it said.

The most recent data from the Department for Transport revealed there were 23,550 crashes on Britain's roads in 2014, resulting in 2,639 deaths and 42,633 seriously injured.

The accidents claimed the lives of just fewer than 1,000 people on England's motorways, and more than half happened between the hours of 6pm and 10pm.

In 2013, figures from the Department for Transport (DfT) showed 577 cyclists were killed on the roads in Britain and 3,079 seriously injured in 2016.
