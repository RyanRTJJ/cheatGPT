 action necessary.

Mr Miliband will say that, despite all the evidence that poverty is on the rise and even with the fact that the lowest income households are getting a bigger share of the national income, Labour's policies would make matters worse for the poorest. A key example will be the bedroom tax, which he will say "will cost Britain's poorest children and families thousands of pounds each year as they struggle to pay their rising bills", while the National Living Wage will "have a devastating impact on the lives of millions of employees".

Mr Miliband will also use the speech to accuse Ed Balls of being "all talk and no action" and will say: "Balls has been at the centre of the problem for a generation and today's speech from a Labour front bench which is as bad for workers as it is for a Labour party."

It will also be the first time that the Prime Minister will give a major address to the Conservative Party following her landslide election victory earlier this month. For many voters the message will likely be simple: a Labour government will deliver less, and for the next five years will offer fewer, more balanced cuts.

The Government's commitment to more borrowing than has been agreed is already beginning to be seen as unsustainable at just £42bn a year, up more than three percent on last year. When Mr Osborne's budget was published last week the Chancellor said: "Despite promises from some backbenchers, the coalition's record on borrowing is becoming less and less sustainable.

"Growth has slowed in recent years and in my own work I've been finding that it has slowed even faster under a Conservative government – by more than 10 per cent in recent years."

However Labour will also say that it will use Mr Osborne's failure to deliver more investment to its own benefits claim – for example by scrapping the "three pence" tax credit which was a key part of the coalition's promise to increase spending to £10billion a year –
