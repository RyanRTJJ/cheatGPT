 he was never there.

Fellow mother Lisa Cribbin was at a family reunion on Kos and heard about the story.

“They said he was found wrapped in a shirt,” said Cribbin, who lives six miles away from where her son was last known to be.

“They thought he might have died but they never figured out which way he went.”

Another grieving woman who was not at the family reunion has found new ways of remembering him.

Pilar, a woman from the Philippines and friend of the missing boy, has written a book about the man she thinks he might be and the circumstances about his disappearances.

There is no official word on what happened to her son, but she believes he left the island and is being held somewhere on the Greek mainland.

It’s a heartbreaking thought after Pilar, a mother of four who was at the family reunion in Kos, said it all became her son’s story when he appeared to be running in broad daylight around the island.

“There was a man running and he was carrying a white jacket,” she recalled.

“He was wearing white trousers and a red jumper.”

She said: “It was quite close to the main tourist areas and people were staring at him, as if he was something else.”

Pilar and her family have been attending family gatherings on Kos at different times. There have even been gatherings with the boy’s paternal grandparents.

“I have been holding the family reunion on Kos for several years now but because of our son’s disappearances and his disappearance, we decided to hold it again to take in the community,” the Philippines woman said. “We tried to stay positive and told the story of our son and how the island had changed, where we came from and how we have fallen in love with our homeland.”

And there are other families who have been waiting for decades to hear from their missing loved ones.
