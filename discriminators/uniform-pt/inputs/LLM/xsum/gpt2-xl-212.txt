 Turkey for the pre-season Turkish Grand Prix.

After missing the last two races due to illness, Nico Rosberg is set to go for a third consecutive win, after coming second in Austria and Canada. The Mercedes driver is one of the few drivers to beat Vettel both seasons in a row, and his race pace is the only area where the German beats the Briton compared to 2013.

The most impressive part of Rosberg's recent performances is that, despite a string of injuries during 2011, he has yet to suffer an engine failure in a Grand Prix. However, since then he has faced a steady improvement in engine reliability, the only car he has struggled with at all is his own. All four members of Mercedes' line up (Ferrari, Red Bull, Mercedes and McLaren) this year have a better engine reliability than the German's.

The only reason that Kimi Raikkonen has managed to keep his engine up to spec in 2014 is due to a switch to Renault last year, and the switch to Renault's ERS was a huge boost for the Finn after he suffered a spate of engine failures in the last couple of years. Renault improved his engine reliability from the 2014 season and he has remained at the front of the field.

However Ferrari's engine woes mean that the team are in serious need to have Kimi Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, the two top Ferrari drivers in 2013 and the 2014 seasons. It is clear that Vettel is struggling a lot more with engine failure, and Hamilton is suffering every year worse than in 2013. It is likely that both will qualify second in Turkey. Rosberg has been the least reliable F1 driver of the year, but that is likely to change once he is fit enough to compete.

The Silver Arrows are the closest to the title now because Ferrari have a long way to go before they can challenge for the title and both Vettel and Hamilton are unlikely to qualify much higher than sixth. Both Vettel drivers, Hamilton and Vettel have done relatively well in qualifying this year, and one of them will need more than 20 points to win if he qualifies in
