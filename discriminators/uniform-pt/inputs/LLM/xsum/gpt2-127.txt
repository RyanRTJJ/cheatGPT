 encroaching world of the Highland clearances.

But not all Highland Clearances are lost to time and hardship. Along with the Highland Hills' inhabitants and their families, she encounters a number of new people from various regions throughout the kingdom. She gets to know these new people through her experience living off of her family's land.

In a world in which every single word in a city is written by hand, where the inhabitants are free to do whatever they like, Barbara Henderson draws her own path into the world of farming.

After witnessing that world, Henderson travels to Highland Clearances to seek the source of the grain they use to make her dreams come true. When she arrives at the settlement of Warkan, there's not much for Henderson to do before she starts her journey to meet and befriend the tribe members of the Warkan tribe.

Throughout the three stories, Henderson is brought up and treated in a way that no other novel does justice. She learns to take on some of the world's toughest and most dangerous creatures during her travels, but at the same time her journey begins a new thread. We never get to see if the people Henderson encounters here want to follow her or not. Henderson must face the world through her eyes, but those she meets are just as fascinating as the ones she sees in this novel.

When Henderson's quest becomes her quest, the book does a great job at making sure that the characters that populate Warkan are always able to tell a true story.

In addition to the other three stories, the novels come with a special special treatment for fans of the other novels from this collection, such as this one, the story of Toren in the Land of Hope.

The entire anthology, which will be released at a later date, tells you all about Toren, his adventures with his friends and the characters he meets on his journey through the land of Hope.
