Theresa May is to set out her UK general election manifesto for voters at a media event in Cardiff on Monday afternoon. The document is likely to focus on jobs and the economy, with Mrs May expected to argue that Britain will outperform other EU states.

At the Labour party conference in September, the prime minister will argue that a Tory win would allow her to pursue a "fresh and bold" government.

In September, there will also be two debates focused on immigration and Brexit.
