His words have been widely disseminated on social media despite the incident being "not a major incident in Palestinian life", according to Abbas.

Israeli authorities have not said how they will deal with the issue, or whether further action would be taken.

The show also airs online on NTV through an arrangement that NTV has with NTC, a pan-Arab satellite broadcaster.

An episode in which Sobky was interviewed on his show was viewed over 350,000 times since it was uploaded on NTV's official Twitter account and Facebook page on Monday.

"NTVâ€™s Twitter account, Facebook Page and Instagram account were contacted on Monday afternoon regarding the guest featured on episode, 'Toureed' and he responded that he was misquoted in their interview," NTV said.

"NTV also received a call from Tamoud al-Sobhy via email and responded stating the show was in fact a private programme with a very limited scope," it added.

The guest was also invited to write a guest entry for NTV's website, according to the show, which said it is still scheduled to air on its channel on Monday.

NTC, which broadcasts on NTV's main channel, said it was unaware if Sobki was still being paid as of Monday.

The Gaza ministry of communications released a statement that read: "The purpose and impact of the incident has been explained through a letter sent to NTC by Al-Aqsa TV.
