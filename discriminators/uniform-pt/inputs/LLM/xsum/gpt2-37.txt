 28 per cent to £5.44bn.

There could be a slowdown in television advertising in the future as advertising is a low-cost consumer product, said Rupert Murdoch, chief UK TV business adviser.

"Some companies might need to go to the edge... as the technology grows," he told reporters.

However, he cautioned there was more to come. One major issue was that advertisers might prefer a larger range of channels.

Mr Murdoch said it was "absolutely going to be more challenging for TV content to cross over into other forms", making it a "critical part of our long-term strategy".

"The BBC may not be the most powerful but it will be still the only provider of TV content," he added.

It would need to raise the cost of broadcast subscriptions to £634,000, for example, which is about five times the cost of a new broadcast, but the biggest broadcaster could make up for that, he said.

"There are now two million BBC viewers across the UK, and our audience will grow steadily - we are on top of that," he said.

"But a bigger broadcast commitment to reach 5.4 million people in 2016 would be really hard to sustain without delivering huge and sustained growth for both BBC and BBC content," he added.

The BBC has an annual budget of £1.55bn ($1.61bn), and is expected to spend up to £750m a year on digital content.

This is the biggest UK media market and TV market share in the world for online TV content, with an average of 9.2 million watching one-hour shows in the first nine months of 2016, according to IFC

Mr Murdoch suggested the BBC might consider offering more online content but added: "It's very much a business to us as a broadcaster."

The BBC will seek to expand for business-creation reasons, with the UK channel building in the form of four new programming programmes each year.

One of the new programmes will be "The Great Challenge", which Mr Murdoch said was aimed at children with autism.

The BBC's new programming focus will focus on more innovative programmes and the BBC will introduce new programmes every day that
