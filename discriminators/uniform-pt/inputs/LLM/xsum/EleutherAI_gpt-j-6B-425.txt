In July, the Foreign Office said it was aware of "disturbing" trends in the numbers of British personnel killed and wounded in Afghanistan.

The MoD confirmed that a number had died on British territory and at sea.

The number of British personnel killed in Afghanistan to the end of June was 40.

The army said it had deployed extra troops in the worst affected areas of Helmand, where the Taliban has a strong, fortified stronghold in the village of Sangin.

The deployment has brought the total number of Afghan local security force members to more than 4,400. Some 500 more have been trained and are ready to go, and the MoD says the force will reach that level within weeks.

The army has been given the green light by CDS Gen Mark Carleton-Smith to begin planning for a "small force footprint".

The Royal Marines were given a more limited role during the summer, while the remainder of the army concentrated on counter-insurgency efforts - but now will be given a more significant role.

They will be on the ground for longer
