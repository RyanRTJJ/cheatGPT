 of Canterbury, Lord Carey, urged the government to put the cap ahead of Brexit and the rising cost of the NHS. “The Prime Minister’s unilateral decision,” wrote Carey in the Sun’s Sunday Times, “to impose tax and spend targets that are incompatible with our long-term national mission, our economy and the wellbeing of our nation is a tragic error.”

The Treasury is already grappling with a massive £47bn (£45bn) national-debt pile, due in part to the austerity policies of the past 20 years, which it cannot now afford to meet. Its latest estimates suggest the NHS crisis will cost the economy £20bn over the next three years. It can ill afford another £17bn, which will have to be borrowed. This would be on top of the £10.4bn spent on EU membership over the last 20 years; it would also come in addition to the £2.2bn that the Treasury spent on the NHS for each of the past four years, and on foreign aid (£3.2bn); on £6.6bn spent on the arts; on £11.3bn set aside for international aid; the £1.35bn spent on the arts; the £24.4bn that the arts spend on outreach by the government and the Arts Council; the £11.5bn that the arts council spend on art schools and colleges; the £24.2bn made available to the arts by the Arts Council every year; and on £26.6bn the Treasury has set aside to pay the salaries and benefits of all its non-executive public-sector staff.

This means that if the government’s national-debt pile were instead to be added to a £45bn National Debt, it would instead fall to £48.6bn. This is far closer to the amount of the welfare budget than the
