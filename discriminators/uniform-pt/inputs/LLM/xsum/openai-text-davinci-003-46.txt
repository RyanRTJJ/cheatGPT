 will come back to a dramatically altered WTA Tour, which has been dominated by younger players and new champions. Williams is taking an extended break from the game and almost the entire top-10 have changed in the wake of her layoff.

Sharapova, who has not played formally since August 2015, will join a field that includes Caroline Wozniacki and Angelique Kerber, the top two players in the world rankings, as well as three-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova and former US Open champion Flavia Pennetta.

The tournament will be the first chance for Sharapova to assess her general condition and her ability to compete at the top on the WTA Tour. She is expected to have an extra incentive in Stuttgart, having won the event three times before.

The Russian will return to the Tour in Madrid, which starts the week of April 24. At the French Open, which begins the second week of May, Sharapova is set to be seeded right outside the top-32 and, depending on her ranking position, could get a protected seeding.

Sharapova has been working on her recovery with her long-term coach Thomas Hogstedt, as well as with physical trainers, who have been helping to prepare her for the rigours of being back on the tour.
