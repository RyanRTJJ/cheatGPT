ince 2009/2010 and currently only has 2,400 officers. Collins has said that without additional funding, West Yorkshire Police will be unable to tackle increasing crime levels, providing enough resources to neighbourhood policing teams or improving the lives of local communities.

Collins has said that West Yorkshire Police is “treading water” and its resources are “growing increasingly thin”. She has complained that the funding situation is “unsustainable” and believes that police forces need additional funding to increase staffing levels and invest in preventative measures such as neighbourhood policing and community safety initiatives.

In line with government policy, West Yorkshire Police has implemented a range of measures to do more with less money. This includes introducing various cost-saving initiatives such as sharing resources with other forces, streamlining processes and the introduction of a workplace analytics tool to free up more personnel.

However, Collins is still concerned that this isn’t enough and that more public money needs to be invested in policing and community safety if the UK is to reduce crime and keep its citizens safe. She has also raised concerns that current police forces cannot justify increasing their budgets without additional investment, as they are already under pressure to deliver savings in order to balance the books.
