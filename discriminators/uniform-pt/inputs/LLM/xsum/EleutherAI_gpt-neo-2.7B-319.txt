 receive more appropriate primary care and continuing education in self-care, nutrition and diet, and pain.

The report, titled A New Way to Care: Understanding the Patient Experience in the Emergency Department (ED) of the Royal London Hospital (RLH) NHS Foundation Trust is based on an in-depth review of the Trust’s ED, which has over 50,000 attendances during a typical day of duty.

The report highlights the Trust’s work to help the public make better healthcare choices, including having easy-to-navigate websites and being able to use online forms without having to attend the Trust’s website. The Trust also promotes and encourages people to make an empowered choice in choosing their initial treatment and care as the Trust was ranked first in England and last in the NHS across 28 measures and 17 indicators.

The Trust has also taken steps towards having a patient-centred ED, by introducing the Patient Care Advisory Group (PCAG). PCAG is a new system to collect the views and experiences of patients and carers about their experience of care in the Trust’s ED and provide feedback about priorities and care options. The Trust also introduced a new appointment scheduling strategy for the ED.

This year, the Trust began a rolling programme of activities aimed at improving care for patients who presented through its ED with life-threatening clinical presentations. The programme includes introducing clinical guidelines, clinical pathway systems, an integrated electronic health record system, and new patient experience measures.

“The Trust’s ED has been recognised as a trusted patient voice for several years for both high-level clinical and service user satisfaction and this report is an excellent overview of some of the work that has been achieved,” said Dr. Peter Wain, Lead of Specialist Services for the Trust.“Our services will continue to adapt and evolve our services to meet the needs of patients, while also ensuring that they always receive the right care for their needs. We hope the Trust's work in meeting needs and supporting people in choosing the most suitable care, can be seen by others as a ‘model’ of what a great patient experience should look like and that can only ultimately be recognised and improved through the trust’s commitment to continuing to improve.
