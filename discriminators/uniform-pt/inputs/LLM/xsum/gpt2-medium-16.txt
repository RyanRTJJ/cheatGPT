 their desks and the children jumped up into a high perch, with their feet in the air. 'It's like, they're jumping up there because it's doing what they think!' she said. 'It was definitely not an attempt at restraint.' But this does not explain why she could not find a way to give kids a footrest. This could seem odd on its face. 'It is possible there is actually no footrest in here', she said. 'There's no way to keep them sitting where they are.' As is common in a place like Japan, this is not an attempt at "messing with the kids". It's just a strategy to remove children's natural inclination - a human tendency of a kind. But it also makes no sense - and we'd suggest it makes no sense if the school couldn't do it. What we know about the history of foot rest schools is that they are nothing new. When Japan's brutal industrial revolution began, Japanese families abandoned their homes to find work and, over the next years, they built huge shantytowns in the countryside. These shantytowns came at great cost to education and communities. Because they were tiny, they would never reach their full potential - because, for Japan, land was property. This led to a widespread belief that the only way to build schools was to develop thousands of shanties. The practice spread to America, where people adopted the practices with great fervour, though America's first schoolhouses had been constructed before the Civil War. By 1900 schoolhouses still filled much of the southern USA, but the trend was to close them to children: schools in the UK had been constructed in many areas by 1907; the number of schools closing since 1913 has meant we were on a path to having fewer than 1.5 million schools. (By the time Britain joined the OECD in 1987, the figure included children with disabilities.) Today it is estimated that around two-thirds of schoolchildren receive education from private providers, such as schools, nurseries or daycentres. But according to the Children's Society of England, in England
