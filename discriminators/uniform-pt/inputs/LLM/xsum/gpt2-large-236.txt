 girl to pay the father, who had taken out the abortion order, an amount of Rs 20 lakh in damages and set aside the remaining Rs 40 lakh as interest. The girl's family and lawyers are expected to appeal the verdict.

Pro-life activists in a recent video that went viral stated that if "the woman is alive, there will be no birth of any human being in future in India."

In a video, activists from Nirmal Mahila Panchayat told reporters, "If a woman becomes pregnant but aborts without saying 'Om kahin ho!' (I am pregnant) at her funeral will be held and a'mahila' will be awarded. If her'mahila' is awarded, the man who has fathered her will have to pay the family Rs 20 lakh. If the'mahila' is not paid by the family, then it will be awarded."

Pro-life activist Kalyan Singh told a local news channel, "The court also ordered the man to pay the girl's family Rs 10 lakh. We want a life sentence to be awarded for this rape. A court order is not going to solve the problem. There is no need to be in touch with anti-abortion and pro birth control NGOs since they are now spreading lies."

This is not the first rape case that has triggered a debate among the media. In December 2014, a three-year-old girl was raped in a public bus and raped again within four hours. The rapists, including the driver, used mobile phone calling technology to summon the victim and threaten to kill her so "she won't go to their houses again".

In May, an 11-year-old girl's body was found dumped in West Bengal. Following the incident, many people called for a law that would criminalise rape.
