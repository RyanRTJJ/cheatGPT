The 19-year-old Crawford (28-0, 14 KOs) had been scheduled to fight for the WBC title in Japan but the sanctioning authority there has refused to play ball with the WBC's proposal that the fight take place in Mexico instead. He later said he was unhappy with the matter but will likely face WBO heavyweight champion Timothy Bradley in a showdown to determine who is the reigning titleholder."I've been playing the game in California trying to push an end date and I don't want to have to leave Nebraska. I've made the last decision," the younger Crawford said. "For me, it was something personal. I've been training hard and getting ready for this fight and to get to be a world champion is something I can't go back on. This was something I couldn't make up my mind to move forward with my life."Crawford won the WBC super-bantamweight belt in late 2012 after beating Raymundo Beltran in the championship fight in December. He defended his title with a second championship victory over Luis Ortiz in January 2013 in Mexico City. Crawford has a win over former WBC super-bantamweight titlist Takashi Ueno and a draw with Carlos Takamaki, among others.The WBC says Crawford will be allowed to travel to the United States to participate in the WBC World Super-Bantamweight Championship Match on May 7 in Mexico City.Crawford said it's not yet clear who the new WBC super-bantamweight champion will be, but he is aiming for a rematch with Ueno, the No. 1 contender and WBC king.
