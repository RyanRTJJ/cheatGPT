 Sarah Taylor's partner Katherine Brunt to end the innings, England's hopes of a big total faded.

It was also a frustrating day for Australia as they lost key batswomen Nicole Bolton with the score on 97 - the fastest for a five-wicket haul - and Ellyse Perry on 28 to give the hosts a much-needed boost after their below-par fielding display.

England's run chase was carried by skipper Heather Knight, who made a valiant 54 from 106 balls to ease the pressure after losing early wickets. But her dismissal left England in complete turmoil at 130-6 as she became England's first run-scorer since Rachel Priest for four in the 12th over in the 16th over when she was caught in the slips off Katherine Brunt.

But with the field reduced to nine and Amy Jones dropped on 14 by a diving Brunt at backward point, Australia's bowling was restricted to just one wicket in an otherwise forgettable day for the hosts.

Having started well with Danni Wyatt (7) caught behind off the wicket at the third ball of the innings by Elyse Villani, England lost two quick wickets - Charlotte Edwards (11) by being trapped lbw by Tayla Vlaeminck and Fran Wilson (23) caught by Alyssa Healy at cover off Sarah Taylor.

In reply, Australia were off to a solid start as Perry survived an lbw check by Kate Cross, only for her dismissal to be reviewed and overturned as her middle stump was clearly plumb lbw.

Although Wyatt top scored with 43 and captain Heather Knight made a valuable fifty, England's batting was
