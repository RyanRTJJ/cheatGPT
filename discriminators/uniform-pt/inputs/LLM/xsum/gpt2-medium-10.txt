 started by summer 2017.

"Transport Scotland is committed to tackling the issue by the end of 2015, although all work must be done during the Autumn Statement," said Scottish Government transport spokesman Chris McKay. "The Government is asking everyone involved to start the work in December."

While Transport Scotland is not yet clear on the full extent of the problem, one expert told TheJournal.ie it is one of "complex issues".

"This has got to come to that stage when you know that there's going to be a big-picture transport programme going on; it will change the whole relationship with the public and in particular from a political point of view with the north," said John Stewart, a Senior Lecturer in Transport Studies at the University of Dundee.

"And you know these things are very difficult to study but have impact. You can tell by reading some of the literature that they do, but it is very hard to make sure your studies can be the most important one-stop shop in transport."

"The real-time delivery model of big-city transport cannot allow you to provide that service at the same time," he added.

Transport Scotland is also aware that while some drivers have been working to help tackle the issue, a number are not.

While the project is to be overseen by the Transport Management Agency (TMA) which is currently running the Transport Scotland pilot project to examine the relationship between road users, their motorists and cyclists, there are also plans to look at more specific aspects such as how new routes are delivered and how to best distribute them across a given corridor.

"We're keen to get on with it. This pilot project provides lots of insights but we are working quite closely with the local authorities to bring the work into full swing. There have been some successes [with some areas of the region, for instance] but work is still continuing to understand their concerns and try to come up with a solution," Jim Kelly, the Deputy Scottish Transport and Infrastructure Minister, said.

Kelly also stressed there is yet to be an official cost of the project yet due to have to be approved by the TMA, but he explained
