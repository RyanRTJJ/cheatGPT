1 million in 2015, and in both 2009 and 2009-10 they were more than 2.2 million.

The number of cars registrations increased by 38% between 2013 and 2015 to a record high of 876,000. The number of light vehicles recorded at an annual growth rate of 17% in 2015 was a new record high.

In the meantime, the number of motor-houses in England is down by 16% to 6071,000. The UK record of 707,000 is for 2010.

The statistics, compiled from official registrations at the local authority level, are based on information supplied by more than 5,000 organisations including councils, insurers, vehicle manufacturers and insurers.

These include government agencies and independent contractors, aswell as the voluntary sector, car dealers and the private sector.

The full detailed breakdowns of these statistics by local authority will be published in due course.

The Department for Transport (DfT) said the rise in registrations in 2015 represented the first increase since 1992.

The largest fall in registrations was in the City of London, which recorded just a 1% decrease.

In the London borough of Wandsworth, which covers Lewisham and East Newington, registrations were down by 40% to 977,900 vehicles.

Wandsworth borough chairman Russell George explained: "We are disappointed with the figures and, as a borough-led city council, the vast majority of our area's population is living in the private sector.

"For this borough to break down to a reduction of 40 per cent in light vehicle registrations is a very disappointing decrease."

He added that, to some degree, the increase in car registrations "was justifiable" given the increase in fuel prices.

However, other local authorities were not as much affected by the fall in emissions as Wandsworth, with Birmingham, Leeds and Middlesbrough recording a fall in registrations of around 12%.

Car experts have also spoken out in support of the drive to cut emissions, following a recent consultation by industry to set out how the industry could reduce emissions of
