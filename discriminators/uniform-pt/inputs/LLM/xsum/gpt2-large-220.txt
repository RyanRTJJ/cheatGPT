"The past 18 years have been an incredible adventure and I want to thank everyone who has shared their ideas, feedback, and encouragement. The success of this company has been a testament to the strength of the company's people, the commitment and spirit of innovation, and the people's desire for progress."

My time here has helped create what will live on as the world class coffee company that we know Starbucks is today."
