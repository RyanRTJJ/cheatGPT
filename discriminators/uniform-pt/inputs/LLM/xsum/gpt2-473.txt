 posts had claimed he had a number which was hidden by a man wearing a helmet. Police arrested him during raids in January, 2015 and he had been convicted under a 2015 Scottish Criminal Justice Act charge for "inciting death and grievous bodily harm" with intent to do so.

According to the court documents, Morton was wearing a jacket at the time of the incident and "one of the members of the group posted this picture on his Facebook page to the 'new' post:

An officer of Glasgow Police took a photo and video of the video and alerted the Crime Command on 3 September 2014. In March 2016 a private body camera company was hired to capture the encounter.

On October 6, 2013, a Facebook post was shared by Morton, claiming he had a new picture of the man. On 11 November of last year he posted a picture of the second man in a man-of-the-moment video, which has since been deleted. The photo that Morton posted was of police responding to a public address about the incident.

The man involved posted the pic to Twitter and the men were spotted together after they arrived with the phones. Later when the police had arrived on scene, the man claimed he had to call an ambulance because he didn't have any money but the incident itself was described as a "chilling and frustrating" incident.

In February 2015 Morton appeared before the court and was sentenced to six years imprisonment. He has since changed his name and had his driver's licence renewed and a new address removed from his profile.

His current address appears as Lough Erne and was removed after discovering it had been stolen.

Anyone without reasonable excuse or understanding of the facts surrounding a person's behaviour, including the likelihood of making the offence is not able to be held criminally responsible for their behaviour.
