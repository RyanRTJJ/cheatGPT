 had been found in the search area on New Guinea.

Mr Morrison says an urgent search will continue for the missing and he praised the bravery of relatives and loved ones of those on board who have shown "extraordinary courage" in coping with the tragedy. He promised Australia's support for Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.

"I know, because I experienced for myself the power of resilience at the recent fires in the Australian Outback, that we are in a fight for lives here and as I've said from the outset we will do anything, everything to secure further survivors," he said.

Boat search suspended

In a nationally televised news conference, Mr Morrison told families there would be "an immense toll to pay" from the loss of loved ones.

"My heart goes out to you, as it does to the victims' families and friends.

"We will be here for you, we will help you grieve and we will be with you for the weeks and months to come."

He said police had suspended the search for the missing but crews would stay on standby in case survivors could be found.

There was a "substantial and potentially deadly storm" heading towards New Guinea which was expected to hit the search area by midday, he added.

Family members told The Australian newspaper that the search had been suspended because the conditions were "too dangerous".

The relatives had previously rejected government offers to fly search planes in at twilight and dawn, saying it was not possible due to the conditions.

Relatives told ABC radio that they feared the missing were being swept further into the ocean and the current was "pulling them away".

"It's a waiting game right now," one relative told the ABC.

In a media interview earlier today, Mr Morrison refused repeatedly to put a timeline on when the search would resume.

"It's the same as I indicated at that point in time," he said.

A spokesman for the US Navy said the missing boat was not part of America's search and rescue operations on the high seas.

A spokesman for Maritime New Zealand said it also had no part in the search operation.

Family members said they were grateful to the Australian, Indonesian and Papua New
