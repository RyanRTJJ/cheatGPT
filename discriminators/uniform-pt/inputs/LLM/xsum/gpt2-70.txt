 has to come in and take a rest."

Davis Cup, originally scheduled to be held at Wimbledon this summer, was due to be played at the London 2015 Olympic Stadium before being moved to St Mary's Arena in May, but Wimbledon refused to allow a major tournament to take place because of the 'anti-climactic effects' on the Davis Cup's integrity.

"There must be no more such events being held that will disrupt the Davis Cup and the integrity of the tournament," Bernstein said. "The Wimbledon Foundation and the London organisers must act with urgency to ensure that no more events take place and that the Davis Cup becomes an alternative to the Davis Cup in all its forms."

The event, which opens on 29 April, will feature a traditional Wimbledon battle in a three-piece round robin format that rivals the US Open.

The match is to be held between four women's teams as part of the best ever Davis Cup final. Two more teams from the USWNT, which will also appear on the final night of Wimbledon fixtures, will also make up the quarterfinals.

Watson added: "It's very clear to me what the tournament has to do with Roger. He won't be able to take on any of them, if at all, and I understand that. However, I have to recognise he's the first winner of a major game. It's not like there's anything going on at the end of his first game."

Asked if he will take on more US tennis on Thursday in front of the entire world at Wimbledon, Watson said: "It's up to Roger's men as well. I'd like to make sure as little of us as possible do what we can to ensure he feels comfortable being here."
