 increasingly likely to cycle or take public transport even as private car ownership in the UK is set to reach an all-time high.

The ITC looked at the number of daily journeys by car, bike and bus compared against the number of journeys by public transport, bicycle or walk and found that private car use increased as did cycling and walking levels in the last two decades. More women now take public transport compared with men, although this gap is starting to close.

However, younger people are ditching cars as more and more opt in to public transport such as trains. In London, buses are now much more popular than other forms of travel and are used for 57% of journeys.

Meanwhile, car journeys in the Midlands have increased by 13% since 1992, in Northern Ireland they are up by 13% and in Scotland by 11%. Despite these figures, the number of cars purchased in England has almost doubled in the last 20 years.

“We should be looking at how we create the conditions for more sustainable forms of travel, such as electric cars, while recognising it’s right and proper that people drive,” said Nick Goldsmith, ITC chairman.

“More can be done to improve transport in the UK and this report highlights an area where it’s clear government needs to take action.”

Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said he would be looking at the report, noting that the ITC’s call for more to be done is “very sensible. We’re listening to the public, and to businesses – the more people who travel by public transport the less demand there is for our road networks, and the less risk to the people who use them.”

A report on Monday from the Department for Transport found that in 10 years’ time the number of licensed private vehicles across the country will have increased by more than a million, to 20 million or more. Currently there are 17.7 million cars in use across the UK.

The ITC is the independent body that reports to the Department for Transport.
