 and National Security Agency spy-catcher, has not been charged.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian television he did not think the move was necessary.


'All he has been doing is feeding [the] CIA with information with which he hoped to acquire more information,' he told the state-run Rossiya 24 TV channel.

He added: 'As far as I know this is not part of any foreign intelligence system.'


A spokesman for the Russian embassy said 'this is not the first intelligence-gathering operation of a man connected to the Kremlin'

Russia's acting President Sergei Lavrov has said the spy scandal could have implications for relations between US and Russia

The ambassador, Yuri Ushakov, told RIA-Novosti he had received no official notification of the suspension of the visit, and denied rumors that the visit was linked to the lifting of sanctions imposed by Russia and the US.

"We have not received any formal notification from the President that this is a reason for the suspension of our [foreign] mission... We are a country which loves our people. We can trust them... this is not a reason for suspending our mission," Ushakov said.


A spokeswoman for the US State Department refused to comment on the suspension of the Kavkazov's visa, which was issued in the aftermath of Russia's 2008 intervention in Georgia, and said Russia played any role in the conflict that helped end Ukraine's former communist regime.

The Foreign Ministry dismissed the US claims as 'irresponsible' and called for 'an immediate clarification of this scandal within 48 hours'.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said American intelligence and sanctions had driven Russia and the EU to the point of 'war'.

'The US has acted with reckless abandon. There is a war,' he said in televised comments.

Lavrov said he had asked US Secretary of State John Kerry, on Monday, for a full explanation.

An investigation was begun when the US Treasury Department discovered the Kavkazov's passport and travel document were invalid in April. US officials had been investigating earlier this year for suspected tax evasion.
