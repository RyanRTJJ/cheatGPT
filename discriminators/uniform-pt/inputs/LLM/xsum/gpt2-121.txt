 expects this year's overall new cases to increase by more than 50 percent, as the number of cases continues to recede.

In June, new cases were reported in six U.S. cities (San Francisco was the most populous, with 22), with 10 on the rise along with Philadelphia.

PHE is calling on people to come forward with information about the cases. "We continue to investigate all suspicious activity and work with law enforcement officials to solve these cases quickly and swiftly," said Phil Kerpen, vice president of marketing and operations for PHE.

Police departments across the country have reported the large number of newly injured people in their communities, prompting more law enforcement and community leaders to focus more heavily on the problem.

Philadelphia Police Chief James O'Neill spoke about the police shootings and praised community leaders in the state who responded to the incidents. "We want to help people and change a lot of things, and we're going to do the work, but we will not change things for the better," he said in a press conference. "We're not going to change things by putting out fireworks."

Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter told FOX26 last month that the city's police department's officers are not as well compensated as they once were. Nutter said law enforcement has to provide more service, and he said Philadelphia already has more money to pay for it in the future.

"You can make your living at whatever price you want. And you also have to be honest with yourself to make sure you get what you gave," Nutter said.

The city has made significant progress and Mayor Nutter indicated a big effort with community officials and police from around the world will be underway for that.
