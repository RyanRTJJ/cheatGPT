In an interview to French radio's "France 4 France", Ms le Pen said that her "progressive" foreign policy would take advantage of "the weakness of Daesh" and the lack of "a strong and united national state."

"It has to do with how to deal with the Syrian crisis in their home country as well as abroad," she said, comparing a government line to the "American-backed Syrian conflict".

Asked whether the country would ever consider establishing an armed opposition grouping, she said: "In other words, we have to understand what Daesh is and who is it really is".

In June 2015 Ms Le Pen led France's National Front party against a coalition of left-wing parties after it emerged that its leader, Marine Le Pen, had been behind a deadly chemical weapons attack in eastern Ukraine on August 13, 2014.

She is seeking to reclaim the center-right French Socialist Party, which gained control of the European Parliament in 2015 during President Michel Temer's rule, after nearly 30 years of being led by her father, Fran√ßois, which still governs the country.

Ms Le Pen said on Tuesday she had been "disappointed" by the "imperfective and cynical" treatment of France's far-right, which she has called "a terrorist group".

"I was in this country with my father in France five years ago. We had different cultures, different ideas, different ideas," she said.

"We shared many different things. France and Germany in particular, had similar values but also different values. But in fact, they were so different. France had more and more radical ideas and values. Now it can become a terrorist state."

Mr Temer, who has promised to bring Islamic State militants to France, has long maintained he has done little to improve the country's image internationally due to the rise of radical Islamist movements.

He said on Thursday that "France will not allow any radicalism towards France's national security policy" if it became known that Mr Le Pen had funded "foreign fighters" or terrorist groups in Europe.
