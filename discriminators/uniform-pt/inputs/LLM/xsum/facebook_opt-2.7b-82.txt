 was also absent for their comeback show in London in April.

"So what's going on with us? They cancelled the gig," he told a fan on stage in Hamburg tonight. "Oh right, Reni. He has a really bad cold."

The singer then looked out at the crowd and said: "Sorry that I am on my own. I'm sick, I need my little one. Bye love."

The band, who released a best-of record for their new album, had planned to tour Europe this summer before embarking on a short U.S. trip in September.

Their Hamburg appearance was to have been their first in Germany since 2006 and their first return to Hamburg since 2003.

It was originally planned as a two-night show but, citing illness, Reni was later forced to back out. The final lineup was: lead singer and bassist James McCaughrean, guitarist Mark Pirroni and Reni Rhodes on keyboards and backing vocals.

"I've been trying to change my life," Reni told the crowd at the end of their debut set. "What can you do? You can drink more, drink more... but I can't!"

After Brown's set ended, a brief altercation ensued outside the venue, involving members of the crowd and security personnel.

Brown has had his own tumultuous history with his former bandmates, but he and Brown have reconciled.

It was Brown's first public appearance since the band's London show a month ago and, like tonight, Reni was notably missing from the set list.

Despite that, it was a strong turnout at tonight's gig with many fans arriving in advance to the venue.

Following the band's appearance in Hamburg, they play their final show of the tour in Rome on Saturday evening.

They are then due to wrap up the North American leg of their summer tour with one last concert in Sacramento.
