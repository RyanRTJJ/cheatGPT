 by someone who was only revealed as a potential source of funds to Mr Hogan's own attorneys. The billionaire investor Peter Thiel, a major contributor to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, is said to have made the donation.

When Mr Hogan started his legal fight, there was speculation that his lawyers might sue Donald Trump for defamation. When Mr Trump responded to the case in April by tweeting that Mr Hogan's sex tape of Mr Trump must have been planted by Mr Hogan, a federal judge ordered Mr Trump to stop calling Mr Hogan a "slime ball" - until Mr Trump stopped the criticism itself, which Mr Trump did not seem to do.

Mr Trump's personal legal troubles began when it was revealed last week that, as a presidential candidate, he shared and published an intimate video of a married woman, during a meeting with her husband. Mr Trump's lawyer has said Mr Trump did not know the woman was a porn star.

In addition to being filmed in bed by a porn star, Mr Trump says he had sex with her - but is now claiming he didn't.

Mr Trump had been married to his third wife, Melania Trump, for 11 years. They divorced a decade ago and she gave birth to their son in 2005.

Mr Trump is the owner of a luxury property in Las Vegas. But the mogul also claims to be worth more than $10bn. The Wall Street Journal has learned that the billionaire filed a false report this year to the state attorney general's office, asserting that he was worth $11bn and worth $1bn more in his tax returns that his accountant says are due out any day now.

One source says Mr Trump has spent years trying to improve his finances by cutting back on his own expenses and avoiding tax payments on business losses he incurred in early years. He could not be reached for comment.
