sive, fast-moving game and they will be confident they can take on Scotland in Scotland and get a result," the former Lions hooker added.

Nicol has backed Scotland to eventually break the 40-year wait for a win over their Celtic neighbours. He said: "I'm not sure about this first game but Scotland have the ability to make it happen this year.

Nicol also thinks Scotland are well-positioned with the World Cup just around the corner. "They have a good coach in Gregor Townsend and some exciting players," he said. "The team has had a couple of good results in recent months. They have good momentum and the players have grown in confidence. I think they are well-placed to challenge for the Six Nations title."

This is an example of a balanced news report. It studies the situation from multiple angles and uses evidence from an expert to back up its claims. Nicol presents an impartial view of the strengths and weaknesses of both teams, while also offering an optimistic take on Scotland's chances of success. The conclusion is fair and neutral, concluding that Scotland are in a good position to challenge for the title.
