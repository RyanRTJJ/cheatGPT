She said Mr Bailey had always been “a model client” and she was shocked to learn of his alleged role in the disappearance of Irish citizen Sophie Toscan du Plantier.

The case, which is due to run for four weeks, is due to be heard at the Criminal Courts of Justice in Dublin and the High Court in Belfast.

Ms Farrell says Mr Bailey did not deny being the person who stood over Ms Toscan du Plantier’s body daysafter she was found at the bottom of a ravine near Schull, Co Wicklow, in December 1996.

She alleged that Mr Bailey’s brother John was also in contact with her in the months after the murder and said she had information from a number of people who had been present at the scene who had also had contact with Mr Bailey.

“Ian Bailey was not a suspect in the murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier, but he was, at the very least, complicit in her murder,” she said.

Ms Farrell also claims that another alleged suspect in the case, the Irish security services, did not disclose the existence of a murder investigation.

The court heard last week that a private investigator who was contracted by two Irish insurance companies to investigate the case was not given access to any relevant
