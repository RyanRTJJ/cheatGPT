 UK and Europe increased at a steady clip.

The PMI also showed a rise in consumer confidence as businesses reported continued optimism and a "strongly improved" sense of security.

UK growth

The PMI showed that the UK's economy grew by 1.5% in the final three months of 2015, the strongest growth since the Bank of England's July 2013 GDP growth figures.

The data supports claims by Finance Minister George Osborne that the recent improvement in the UK's overall economic outlook, based at least in part on the strong employment picture, is evidence of strong global demand.

Mr Osborne has also blamed sluggish global demand for the fall in pound values and also argued that the Bank of England should go back on its stimulus measures to kickstart the economy.

The new GDP figures also showed that for the first time since 2009, growth in public spending in the UK actually exceeded GDP growth.

The figures show that the UK was the only developed country that saw public spending rise at a bigger rate than its private sector output over the last year.

Analysis by The Bank of England showed that the economy grew with private spending rising at a faster rate than public spending.

Inflation also fell for the first time since last June and the economy will have suffered a slowdown over the winter period.

The data also showed that the UK's unemployment rate remained at its lowest since 2008 with 13.6% of the population considered to be out of work.

The UK economy has grown at an annual rate of 3.2% since the first quarter of 2009, with growth of 2.5% in the second quarter of this year, and 2.3% last quarter.

Economists expect the UK's economy to grow by 1.5% for this year, 0.1% for 2014 and 1.1% in 2015.
