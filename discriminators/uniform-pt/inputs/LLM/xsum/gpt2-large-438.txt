1bn on food and drink during the period.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs insisted that it has been working with supermarkets, restaurants and other retailers to make sure all food sold is "100% local".

It said: "[Scotland faces] an important opportunity to continue to build momentum and provide more choices for customers whilst meeting their local food and drink needs."

Stuart MacLaren, chairman of Scottish Tourism Association, told the Herald: "We welcome the idea of a food and drink tax, as shown by HMRC figures. However, we are not sure that businesses will adopt this change of policy quickly, and some experts are concerned this will put people off visiting Scotland.

"If the proposed tax goes ahead, tourists will also have to make a shift of many kilos, while increasing their travel costs, which could cause real hardship to small businesses. Scottish Tourism Association is currently working with more than 2,000 businesses across the country as we look at the issue further.

"The Scottish Government must continue to work effectively with businesses to find a way to increase the volume of food and drink and to increase the amount available for local residents when available. The number of visits to Scotland has continued to increase over recent years, and, when prices remain high, this is simply not possible. There is a growing supply of local produce and dairy products that people can buy from farmers' market and local shops."


Derek Wilson, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said: "If the Conservatives continue to oppose the idea of a 50p rate then any attempt to apply an overall tax on food would fall foul of the Tories' mantra of cutting taxes.

"The last thing this country needs is another round of cuts to the budget. It is up to the Scottish government to find creative ideas like the one suggested by Conservative backbencher Philip Davies and work towards introducing a 'dentist tax'."

Scottish Liberal Democrat MP Stewart McDonald has called for a reduction on the current VAT rate of 23% but not on food and drink.
