, but all those duties can now be automated. All you need to make a video is a Mac computer.

The use of virtual voiceover technology is already a common practice for stations covering non-English programming, explains Paul Zitzel, senior director at the News and Information Association, the trade organization behind TV News Academy. That's largely due to the lack of skilled English-speaking voices that's common in emerging markets. Zitzel says it is now more important than ever to develop resources to meet that need.

"There is a need in all economies to produce local news in the language of local residents," he says.

The technology could also help some stations improve their overall production values by making it easier to use multiple voices in a single program without having to rely on multiple audio tracks.

"In broadcast video, we are still at a point where we talk to ourselves sometimes," he says.

While the technology will be most valuable for small emerging markets, Zitzel says it is also useful for large broadcast markets.

Voice technology could also provide a new tool for news organizations to be more efficient. With a virtual voiceover, the same script would be used in video content in many different markets and languages. The script would cut the production time and cost for those stations dramatically.

Zitzel believes that the rise of virtual voiceover technology shows the trend we are already seeing from all media. The digital world is making the analog business model obsolete, and news agencies will need to adapt as well.

In the long-term, Zitzel says it is unlikely to eliminate the need for foreign or local journalists. But it will definitely change what we think is possible in a newsroom.

If you're interested in seeing the technology in action, Zitzel says he regularly sends producers from his News and Information Association to look at the technology in development. His latest was at IBC a month ago.
