 trips that do not use public transport. In fact more people travelled on foot, or by bike, or by public transport than ever before. We have seen more public transport operators than ever before.

We also know that public transport can be unreliable: people who are in touch with the travel system often have a much better experience than those who are not.

So we are determined that the Government can provide as high-quality transport systems as possible regardless of where you live.

For this to happen, the Government needs to introduce fairer ticketing systems, better customer contact to ensure you get the best value for your money, and make sure tickets are not sold out for two weeks after the date they are issued.

We want public transport to be as cheap and convenient as it can be. A simple two-week wait to travel on your weekly bus, Tube or Docklands Light Railway ticket could be £10, on top of the peak day fares, making it more expensive than it needs to be: more passengers are being pushed to the back of the queue – especially those people with complex journeys such as walking or cycling. We want you to get the very best of public transport – every time, every station, every journey.

But this is no longer just about buses: we are going to be able to bring a much smarter commuter rail service to London and other cities across the UK, with more trains on our network every week, as well as providing greater choice from London to places as far afield as Brighton, Bristol, Brighton & Hove, Manchester and Leeds.

The first train will run towards Ipswich and the West, from 2028 with many more joining from the end of the decade. One-way fares on trains between Leeds and Croydon could be as low as £10 from 2028 - not penny pinchers.

In addition to the new rail services:

We are announcing a new transport fund with the power to help us deliver a wider range of schemes, on top of the Rail Investment Bank, such as the first London Overground service between Wimbledon and
