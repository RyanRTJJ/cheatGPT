 in connection with the bombing that killed her husband.

DUP MP Peter Weir has called for an investigation into the alleged involvement of MI5 which he said had "serious questions to answer".

Mr Adams has categorically denied any involvement in the murder. "I am not Gerry Adams at a press conference. I have not killed my wife. I don't know what you are talking about," he said.

Mr Adams added later: "Any suggestion that I or my party have supported the murder is totally untrue and lies." On Friday, he met Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams in the north Belfast pub where his mother was a regular drinker before taking a call from President Obama. They also shared a meal at a pub near the US President's home. This morning Mr Adams again denied any involvement in his wife's murder. Source: AP

Sinn Féin sources confirmed there was a meeting at a Belfast hospital last week in which the DUP was asked by an injured and traumatised police officer from the murdered MP's constituency about Mr Adams possible involvement.

It is understood the meeting was recorded by the officer and a tape of it was passed to the PSNI to investigate.

Mr Adams has always denied being a key figure behind the murder, which he described as a "political tragedy".

He gave an interview to the Irish Independent in 2002 which said: "I would not be surprised if the police investigation found that the IRA was responsible for Mrs McConville's murder."

He added: "There is no evidence of a link between me and the murder. It is all speculation."

Meanwhile, it is understood DUP leader Arlene Foster asked the PSNI to review all the evidence gathered after she was made aware that a murder inquiry had been launched after the death of Mrs McConville.
