", the court heard.

Hunt, of Cwtch Farm, Llandaff, Cardiff, has denied a charge of having intentionally failed to stop and report an accident.

Following the prosecution of Hunt by South Wales Police, he denied it was an accident.

At a Proceeds of Crime hearing in Cardiff, prosecutor Mark Baker said: "There is ample evidence that it was an intentional act. There is evidence that the two vehicles he was driving were deliberately driven across the path of a police vehicle without making a sound report."

A defence lawyer, Andrew Evans, said the car Hunt had been driving had been stolen by a man called John Lewis.

He said Hunt had been working on the farm when he returned his car.

The court heard that Hunt and Lewis were friends, but the pair have fallen out in recent years.

Judge Simon Jones said Hunt was a man who had an 'interest in criminal activity', adding: "You are capable of any or all of these offences. I accept you are very unlikely to commit any future offences, but I am not sure you are safe in the hands of the community."

A pre-sentence report concluded that under the best of scenarios, he was unlikely to be deported to the United States.

Hunt was jailed for six months, but has been placed on licence for two years and must sign on to a sex offender register for three years.

The judge ordered him to pay a £75 victim surcharge and £200 costs

Hunt was also banned for 23 months from driving a motor vehicle. There are no further recommendations.

The case comes six months after a 16-year-old boy was arrested for a series of road rage attacks in south-east Wales.
