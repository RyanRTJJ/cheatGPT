 after he began running away from Cardiff Central police station. He suffers epilepsy and Aspergers' Syndrome.

A judge ruled that he had been unlawfully detained. The court accepted that Hunt was being subjected to a "march in" by officers who were going through their usual routine of stopping people for identity checks, looking for weapons and taking people to the station. Hunt fled officers twice in their attempts to search him. When they tried stopping as he began to run he challenged them with a loud "shut up", and kept running. It was claimed that Hunt had been warned to stop a dozen times in the past, and had failed to do so.

Hunt was ordered to pay Â£3,000 in court costs and damages. The judge ruled that he had been "unlawfully arrested on an individual basis on the basis of not having identification".

He added: "A reasonable proportion of the public would be of the opinion that the arrest was lawful."

Hunt was arrested in January, after a traffic stop on the A48. He was charged with obstruction of the A48 and released that night pending an identity check and court appearance the next day. At the time of arrest Hunt was holding two half-bottles of cider each weighing 15kg. He had consumed half an ounce.

His arrest caused controversy as Hunt suffers from a neurological condition and is regularly stopped by police because officers do not recognise epilepsy as a disability.

Police were called to the A48 on 5 January, shortly before 9pm. Hunt, who is an amputee due to a brain aneurysm, had been travelling alone on the A48, heading towards Llangefni.

Officers approached the 31-year-old to make a traffic stop; Hunt failed to stop and instead ran off the road and into the field. An officer ran after him with a taser and Hunt responded by flailing his arms and legs around.

They both fell, and Hunt had to be pulled to his knees to stop him damaging his head and spinal cord. He was detained until paramedics could arrive, at which point he was handcuffed, given an alcohol reading of.02 (the legal limit for over-18s is 16), and placed in the rear of a police Land
