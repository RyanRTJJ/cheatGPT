 not hindered their progress but there is no estimate as to how much time remains until they arrive on Everest.

"I don't think it has taken long to know the outcome," said one of the Sherpas. "There has been a pretty good understanding through the race of the timing of me coming back [for the final ascent]. It has been quite a tough call. I am going to be disappointed if they fail to bring me back, or the mountain will not be successful on their last attempt."

While there have been only two previous reports of fatal ascents of Everest, two recent reports suggest that at least four members of expedition 3 to 2 made it to the summit safely, with three of them having to be rescued by Indian mountaineers earlier this month.

There are no other deaths at the Everest base camp following the fatal attempt. Last year's death of four Sherpas was among 21 who died during a helicopter accident near the base camp last week. Two people also suffered life saving injuries after falling from the 3,500m hill at the base of the mountain following the helicopter crash. It is understood that three bodies were recovered from the mountain this morning and an autopsy will be carried out "as soon as possible".

However, more deaths have happened during climbing season on Everest, including that of two climbers in the Indian mountains in June â€“ and a third man died on Everest in September while attempting a fourth climb.

The news comes on the day that Richard Scudamore, the world's most ambitious mountaineer after Everest, was named to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's "red team" of experts.

The first four ascents of the mountain's highest point by an American, Ken Kimraken, in 2002 have brought both controversy and excitement to those who have made the attempt.

While it brought about the first human crossing of Mount Everest, it set up the route of its eventual summit. He and his fellow climber Andy Schleck had not been in physical training for 14 months when they were rescued from the South Col. and sent to base camp on 5,816m (2,800ft) and 11,500 feet above sea level. They fell more than 20 metres short of their total, with 20 deaths
