 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, have developed kite-shaped material that will shield the Webb telescope from the Sun's intense heat. The material, dubbed a "radiatable" shield, is a thin polycarbonate sheet. The shield features an array of micron-sized gold slits arranged in an 8-by-8 matrix. Micron size is a standard of measurement for nanotech in the space technology industry. According to the engineers, the nanofabric appears to be "similar to a sheet of aluminum foil." In a laboratory test, engineers compared it to sheets of aluminum foil. The result: the kite-shaped material had an 8-by-8 matrix of micron-sized holes. As kite-shaped materials have become popular for space shields in recent years, engineers have made some remarkable breakthroughs using these materials. Some materials are made from pure silicon, others use carbon nanotubes for strength. Some are made from pure aluminum, others with silver for weight and stiffness. However, the development of the kite-shaped material is unique. It features a nanotechnology-grade matrix for strength and rigidity; a heat shield made from one atomic-layer of gold (a billionth of a meter thick); and an array of the finest gold slits, arranged in the matrix. Engineers call it an "atomically thin" solution for a space shield.

The Shield. The shield is a thin but strong material made from an "atomically thin" solution and is intended to shield Webb Space Telescope from the extreme heat of the Sun. (The Webb Telescope was built as a collaboration between NASA, JPL engineers, and a German company, Infrared Services. Other partners include Texas Advanced Computing Center, the U.K.'s Open University, the University of Colorado, and other institutions.)
