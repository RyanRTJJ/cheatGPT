 an effort to build momentum for her run for the French presidency in the summer. The massacre has been condemned by other members of his family as a brutal attack which deserves the maximum penalty.

However, just two weeks later, le Pen had a change of heart. It was a move the media saw as her attempt to take the spotlight off the killings of her own family in the name of Islam.
