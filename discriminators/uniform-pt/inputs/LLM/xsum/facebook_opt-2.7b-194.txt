 to be completed by August 2019.

The scheme will be managed by SSE, with the St Nicholas House retail park – home to Debenhams and Sports Direct – also managed by SSE.

A new roundabout will join the A56 eastbound and westbound, joining the site with the A521 south/east – at the junction with the Wintringham bypass.

The scheme will create over 230 jobs for locals and local apprentices. St Nicholas House lies east of the existing B6119 (A56) in Lincolnshire, on the west bank of the River Don.

The new scheme includes an impressive new road layout, including new roundabouts for the A56 and A521.

A key aspect of the project is the creation of a new access on to the B6271 (A51) to St Neots. A new access on to the A521 has also been created for the B6271 at the B6119.

The new traffic management system will be designed to improve traffic flows and provide access to the retail park to local motorists, and the new roundabout will join the A56 and A521, and the A51 and A624.

The St Nicholas House scheme is a major scheme to deliver new homes and jobs and improve journey times and quality along the A56 – a key road in Lincolnshire and across the county.

Andy Jones, managing director of Muse Developments, said: “We are delighted St Nicholas House development is progressing well and we are delighted to be working with SSE and Lincolnshire County Council who will deliver this scheme for the people of Lincolnshire through a joint venture.

“The new road layout will also link to B6271 and provide a wider variety of employment opportunities for people locally. We see the scheme as being a great opportunity to help regenerate the town’s retail park and to create some real jobs.”

A spokesperson for Lincolnshire County Council said: “The scheme is close to completion with works continuing on the roundabouts,
