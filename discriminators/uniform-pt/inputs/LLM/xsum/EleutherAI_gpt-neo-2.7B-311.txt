 of its astronaut on what was supposed to be a "photo op".

Logan starred as a nerdy NASA scientist in films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey. His breakout role was a nerdy but hot astrophotographer in National Lampoon’s Vacation, before he went on to become a well-known comic, host and stand-up comedian.



The 42-year-old, who has not watched the game, tweeted: "A bunch of things to watch tonight. First the Cubs lose, then a space race, and in the middle of that, they win the World Series. Let’s hope we get to see the first moon landing by 2019.

"Then tonight, our #WrightStadium presents a night for #WooHoo! A concert by @CubsFanFarewell on the field with free popcorn for one (and then free popcorn for a year for those tickets)."











His message came as the game was about to start in Chicago. The Cubs' faithful had waited in line for hours to watch the fireworks before the game started.



The Cubs had won just their second National League Division Series championship since 2000.



The Cubs beat the St Louis Cardinals 4-1 to claim their first championship since 1908.



They face the Los Angeles Dodgers in a rematch after the series was drawn 1-1.



Kris Bryant missed the game when he tore his groin muscle. Javier Baez made sure to congratulate the Cubs first baseman on Twitter, adding: "Best player in history deserves more respect then that, so I'm with you."



And now that the final inning had started, the Chicago crowd took over the city, chanting “Chicago Cubs” as the game ended.



But it is a time for celebration for America, not the world.
