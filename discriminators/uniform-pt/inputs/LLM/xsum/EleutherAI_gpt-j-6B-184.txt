, and "the sole authority of the League is in question".

A meeting was called, and the directors unanimously agreed to enter a formal application for re-admission, on terms to be considered afterwards.

Conclusions 

The Football League was in trouble and needed help to survive. The Football Association was not prepared to play a part in helping League clubs in crisis, but its counterpart in Scotland's Scottish Football Association, the Scottish Football League continued to supply clubs in the south and east of England with its income and allowed them to compete.

A proposal, originally made by the Football League to merge the two codes was turned down. Instead, at a meeting of League clubs on 20 February 1912, it applied to the Scottish Football Associatiom to affiliate the league with its Scottish equivalent, which it was permitted to do, but the Scottish Football League did not wish to take part in the "diluting of its own association's revenue". 

The Scottish League took over the running of the southern and eastern divisions in May 1912.

The Football League went into voluntary liquidation on 19 June 1913, and was later reconstituted by agreement with the Football Association.
