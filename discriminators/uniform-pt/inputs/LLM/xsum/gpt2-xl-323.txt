For the past week, more than 15,000 people have arrived in Hungary, some hoping to get a work permit for the winter.

Some people, including families with children, set off from Malta and sailed to Malta the morning after a meeting with Mr Orban on October 11th. Others were brought the night before to Italy by a ferry from South Africa.

In October two Libyan-born migrants drowned off the coast of Lampedusa, Italy, after falling into the sea from boats. The Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said the deaths "were a tragedy", but added: "I hope that their parents
