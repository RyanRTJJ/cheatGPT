 obviously the pin position played a part in that. But it's tough to stay on track when you don't know what the weather's going to be like. This is part and parcel of the game so they all count.''

The pair are two clear in the clubhouse going into Thursday's final round with Craig Parry and Sam Cumblestone also in contention. "We're expecting the course to play really fast. It's probably a little bit more like the last couple of days. We've got a few more shots than yesterday to shoot this week.''

Meanwhile, the lead changed hands several times in the morning. Former Open champion and world number six Louis Oosthuizen held the pace at 11 under with Stuart Appleby two under further back.

Then Oosthuizen put a penalty into the hazard and a birdie putt from the edge and a further birdie from the long range gave him a four shot lead. Adam Scott though was back in contention on 13 under with Peter Hanson, Richard Sterne and Jamie Campbell all a shot back.

Oosthuizen and Hanson both made bogey for a share of the first round lead. Oosthuizen made a triple bogey at the 16th for a seven shot swing and lost the lead to Hanson on 17.

A bogey for Oosthuizen at the final stretch seemed to have blown everything but the pair remained one under for the afternoon.

Meanwhile, on the PGA Tour the first full fledged Tour event of the 2014 season is on course at Atlanta. World number one Rory McIlroy made birdies on five of the final seven holes for a comfortable 1 under par 69 to be level on four under par at mid day. He was three under with Paul Casey and Sergio Garcia at the clubhouse but the group are some way off the pace with the leaders around 11 under.

Trevor Immelman, Martin Kaymer, Scott Piercy and Kevin Chappell all shared first
