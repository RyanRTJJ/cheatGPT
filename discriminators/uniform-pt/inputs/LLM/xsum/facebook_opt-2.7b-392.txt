Prince William met with survivors at the Gisborne Emergency Centre to hear their experiences of the earthquake. He also visited the scene of the disaster from the air.

He said he was deeply moved by the experience.

"I've done a lot of work in Nepal over the years, but to have experienced first-hand what these families are going through is truly horrific. I am incredibly proud of the role the British government is playing in providing immediate short-term support to those affected by this disaster."

"A big thank you to all the volunteers and people who are working extremely hard to get things back on their feet"

New Zealand's ambassador Richard Grenville and the consul general for NZ in London, Ian Mcknight, attended the event.

The ambassador said that a lot of work was being carried out to provide support to Nepal, which was still in the process of rebuilding after the 2015 earthquake which killed 8,000 people.

William concluded his visit by meeting Prime Minister Helen Clark in Parliament to thank her for her recent visit to the UK.

"We are sending our heartfelt best to all those living in Gisborne, whose lives have been turned upside down by earthquakes and aftershocks."

The Prince's Royal Foundation has already announced that it will provide support to those affected by the event. One of the groups it will help is the Gisborne Rotary Club, which has a number of members in the town who were visiting a hospital in Christchurch immediately prior to the earthquakes.

Prince William took part in a charity challenge while in New Zealand on 3 April. He wore a wetsuit while swimming the 40km of the iconic Hauraki Channel, and raised more than $50,000 for charity.

He completed the swim about 36 hours after arriving in New Zealand, from Hamilton to the Taranaki town of Pukenui on the North Island. His friend Chris Eames travelled with him to assist with the swimming challenge.
