In the North there will be a vote on whether to make English councils responsible for managing services while in England it will be debated.

But if the right man is in charge in the first place, he won't make the Scottish government less accountable for managing services. The SNP will say the same thing.

The Scottish government was under the impression that English councils had no choice but to act in line with the law, not with the will of their constituents.

The new SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, is the leader of a majority SNP Government, but the SNP still backs Scotland's independence bid, not independence. This is a sign of how far off they are from the spirit of independence.

We should also remember that this is the first time they will discuss the issue with the Scottish Assembly.

If Labour votes no, the Scottish Government will not be involved. In Scotland's parliament, we now have the power to declare an independence referendum.

Scottish people, their leaders and the Scottish government are all under the impression that there is an agreement on the way forward. If this referendum is passed, it will result in more devolution in Scotland, in some areas where we know people live less well and more bitterly.

If Labour votes no, Labour will know that we are going to have to change our way of governing. That is why I have called for a debate before this.

To avoid a repeat of past decisions, the government is already in the process of implementing a change in the way all services are managed. The new policy won't make people more accountable in this way by means of different services, but the Scottish government will ensure that people will have no further opportunities to take advantage of this change.

If the party is not given the chance to win as many votes in a Scottish parliament and it fails to do so, then the SNP will have no choice but to take back control which will lead to further power
