on.   The Tories are happy to do so. It's just what happens when the country is in the absolute doldrums.
He's not being realistic by saying that the next Labour government would force through all this without damaging the economy.

The SNP need to have a clear ideology as well, else they are a shadow of what Blair and New Labour were.
I know that everyone should know this, but I hope you don't take him for full of beans on the economy.
I have hope that people would know that politicians lie, but I guess you have hope too.
That's a fair criticism, but one that doesn't go away. We have to just bear with him, he isn't out to destroy all that we love, just to try and run us to the ground.
I disagree, I think he wants everyone and everything to suck up to him.
Well, he is human too. He knows that he would be a huge fucking loser if he actually tried to do everything that he's talking about doing.
Well if you have a better plan let him know, but I'm not holding my breath.
Why not, is he any less evil than the rest of the politicians we have in here?
I'm not saying he is any less evil, but he seems to want everyone to be friends, not enemies (except the Tories, fuck them),  where as the rest seems to want to cause as much chaos within the economy as possible.
I understand the sentiment, but what's to stop him turning a blind eye to everything else. I just don't believe the electorate would believe all the promises he'll make and take him at his word. I hope I'm wrong, but I can't see any other alternative.
I'm with you, I genuinely don't think anyone can think he is any less evil than the rest of the politicians. I just don't have faith that the electorate would accept or believe all his promises of a better Britain without being forced over the edge in to a war.
