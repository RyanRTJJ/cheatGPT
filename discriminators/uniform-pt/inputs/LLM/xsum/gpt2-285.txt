 looking for a change.

Racing director Dave King has said he wants to create "a new breed of world champion" - an idea that's in the rear view mirror.

He's not quite sure if a new generation of talent are looking after the championship and is considering the big driver title.

Meanwhile Mercedes team boss Lewis Hamilton said he'll give up any hopes of a return to the grid in the next season if he can stop the gap between the four poles on the grid. He said: "There is good faith in the world that we will be back there next season at this pace but there is no one to help us."

He adds: "For Mercedes and for Mercedes for five years, we have always believed it's possible. It's been a very difficult race.

"It's very, very tough. We've come a long way. We have some really big gains and also some small losses so it can be tough at times. We've worked really hard over the last few months to be honest with you and try to improve and not lose pace on the last lap of the race."

Martin Brundling has long been considered a better car for Mercedes but has now started working with the new race engineer, Michael Schumacher, the boss of Mercedes' new world championship, to improve his squad's technical acumen.

Mercedes have been very successful last year when it was in pole position.

The reigning super-class driver hopes this season to be close to qualifying next year and has to do better when it comes to qualifying strategy. He also says that he expects to finish third next year.

Mercedes first beat Mercedes in 2007 when Felipe Nasr lost out to David Coulthard, but has taken its best chance and has had two wins in the past five seasons to ensure success here.

It's been an impressive season, with the Woking chief saying that this season's win will lead to the "discovery of true World Champion" Lewis Hamilton.
