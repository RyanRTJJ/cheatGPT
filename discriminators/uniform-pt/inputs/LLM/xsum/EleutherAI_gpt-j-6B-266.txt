 using imitation weapons, the force said.

One person ran off, no one was hurt and no arrests were made, officers added.

The force said the incident, which took place in an industrial estate, was "not being treated as suspicious" but it was investigating whether the incident was linked to an earlier report of shots fired and a collision.

The incident began as an armed response to what the force called "fictitious reports of shots fired".

The incident occurred in the area of the Parsonage Estate.

A Hertfordshire Police statement said: 'About 21:15 last night an armed response unit from Stevenage attended a report in the Long Lane area of Borough, regarding shots fired.

"Upon arrival an area was searched but no injuries or arrests were found.

"The area was evacuated and the incident is not being treated as suspicious at this time. The incident is the subject of an investigation and anyone with information should contact Hertfordshire Constabulary on 101 or via the contact us page.

"The public should not be alarmed and it is not a crime scene."
