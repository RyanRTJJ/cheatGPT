 there are some reports also from Brazil, Colombia and other West Asian countries.

A report from Zika expert Jean-Luc Dubuchon last month suggested that if sexual transmission is confirmed, over a quarter of babies born during those months would be affected.

It said one possible reason could be that mothers who haven't been exposed yet to Zika have now been pregnant. Zika vaccines are used on a weekly basis during pregnancy to protect pregnant women before they become pregnant and for children until age 18.

The WHO report estimated that at 12 to 48 weeks of gestation, a woman could pass HIV or cancer risk to her fetus by passing a blood virus like CCR5 â€” DNA sequences that have been linked to cell proliferation in the baby's body.

'We cannot rule out another risk factor if it develops in our study'

In the UK, a government report put off the approval of four trials involving pregnant women starting in April for a total of 40 cases in London.

An estimated 4,500 UK people became infected after a suspected Zika epidemic started in the start of autumn, the largest in recorded history, says health minister Jonathan Ashworth.

"All those who should know are going to be aware it is a matter of great concern over Zika.

"The government is providing clear guidance, as you would expect from the United Kingdom, about how we can manage risk to ourselves before the risk becomes clear," he added.

In total, 2.8 million people have been affected globally from Zika-infected cases reported so far, including nearly 4,000 in Britain.

A total of 12 people have been diagnosed with neurological problems, five with memory problems, five with mild cases of anencephaly, one with developmental delays, two with epilepsy and one with a brain tumour, the UK health agency's report says.

Zika will continue to spread for some time longer in the UK because it is not a vaccine and, if pregnant, can pass around as a virus when antibodies to it are released in young fetuses.
