The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau said Scotland's energy sector was vulnerable to high energy bill increases, increased prices or the closure of operations. If Scotland's energy regulator can't tackle these risks then there is concern they could "impose huge costs on people and businesses that want a clean energy future", it said.

The government's energy and climate change department said there had been substantial progress in energy policy at a national level that has led to "major new investment opportunities and improvements to the energy sector".


The Scottish government said: "There have been no major public complaints relating to energy, gas, electricity or water, although there has been interest and debate about Scottish energy companies including energy suppliers."


Scottish Power said the company's service to customers was "one of our most reliable", and the utility had delivered "the highest level of energy demand on record.

"Our customers have never had negative energy service experiences at any time over the last 25 years and we take very seriously these issues.

"These energy concerns could be the result of either one of the following reasons:

• A failure of Scottish Power's supply management system;

• A failure of Scottish Power's maintenance systems;

• A failure of supply from a supply partner, such as a power station;

• A system failure, including any issue over energy management that would affect quality of services and customer satisfaction.

Scottish Power takes this matter very seriously and continues to meet our obligations under the Energy Act 2008 through our supply management approach."

Trevor Denny, executive manager of Energy Advice Scotland, said the energy regulator had "an important role" in providing independent advice about energy and the environment, and had already made improvements to Scotland's delivery of electricity, such as increasing the size of the independent commission that provides energy data for Scotland.


The Scottish government will publish its recommendations tomorrow.
