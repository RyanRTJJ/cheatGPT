 carried out similar airstrikes around the Syrian town of Deir ez-Zor on June 7, killing two Syrian soldiers. On that occasion, the Russian plane was hit, but no one was injured.

The US, which began its campaign of air strikes in Syria in coordination with its allies, has taken the step to establish a no-fly zone to prevent the further use of arms that could be used against civilians.
