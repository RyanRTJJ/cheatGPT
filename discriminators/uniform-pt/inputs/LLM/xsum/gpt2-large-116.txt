 which starts at the start of the Cairngorms and runs about 100 miles.

I didn't say anything bad about Velothon's intentions, but I do not have a good relationship with people who do things like that.

The Cairngorms organisers made repeated attempts to persuade me to postpone the event as a gesture to persuade me to drop the issue.

On Friday morning, I rang the Velothon Wales event director and apologised on behalf of the organisers. A meeting was arranged with David Davies, who is the Wales Office minister, and I was told: "We will take whatever action is necessary".

'We don't condone any form of discrimination of any type. We respect people's rights.'

However it was clear from my emails and calls that people weren't happy with the way the campaign to oppose Velothon was going. The Sunday Telegraph contacted Mr Davies and asked him to put out an official retraction, as well as to put in a statement to Parliament on its website and on social media. He wrote: "We believe that on the eve of the annual Cairngorms Cycling Race it is best if Velothon Wales was able to carry on as before with all its plans."

He later claimed he had not said the group deserved to be banned, but that he regretted it should have been.

In the end Mr Davies decided he'd take more time to investigate. He met me and asked if there was any issue with the protest â€“ I said no. I explained the protest was due to the planned appearance of Lord Freud at the Velothon Wales event. The minister said: "I have a strong view that we allow free speech while we're banning things like that."

I said I knew there had been a meeting on May 16 to discuss the protests and that that was why it was important
