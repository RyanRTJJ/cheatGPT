ini is set to headline the opening night of the celebrations, which kick off on Tuesday 12th December at 8.30pm.

The city council has confirmed that it will "lead the nation across the world in the greatest celebrations in history" as it prepares to hold its first ever Hogmanay on the Royal Mile.

The council's chief executive Lesley Macinnes said the decision to bring the event to the Royal Mile was a "significant moment in the city's history."

She added: "For more than a decade, Edinburgh has been at the leading edge of celebrating the Winter Olympics.

Edinburgh's Hogmanay is officially named Scotland's capital city's Hogmanay, a party that's said to have been invented there in 1810 to celebrate the birthday of Robert the Bruce. Other Scottish cities have their own, smaller, celebrations.

The city expects to attract tens of thousands of people to Edinburgh Park on Tuesday for a series of events, including an ice-making workshop hosted by Scottish broadcaster STV, a street party hosted by Stornoway Youth Theatre and a piper's concert.

The fireworks will be set off by a team of five professional pyro technicians at around 9pm on Tuesday.

On Friday, the celebrations will culminate in a procession of performers, including the Red Squirrels, Pipe Bands, Drum Corps and Jazz Band, along the Royal Mile throughout the day to the Royal Festival Hall for the official Edinburgh Hogmanay opening party.

The procession will feature a parade of floats from more than fifty organisations.

The procession will be carried out by the Drum Corps, a group made up of members of Scottish schools including St Andrews, Edinburgh Academy, West Lothian Academy and the Royal Academy of Music.

In 2016, former city chief executive Lesley Macinnes described the city's plans to bring the celebrations to Edrington Place as "a momentous moment for Edinburgh."

She said: "We are delighted to have been awarded the contract to host this year's celebration and look forward to working with the event's organisers to
