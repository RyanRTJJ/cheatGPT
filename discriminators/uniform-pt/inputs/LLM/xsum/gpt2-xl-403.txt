 58 off 49 balls to lead New Zealand in his final Test as he was given the captaincy early in the series.

New Zealand could have made more runs with Anderson chasing a top score of 90 from 119 balls but the batsman was not in great form with only 23 runs from 24 overs.

The Black Caps were able to take four wickets in the first five overs after that and Williamson took four of them to help New Zealand close on 173 on a pitch that suited their bowlers.

McKellar, who had taken the No. 2 position behind the white ball in the batting order until McCullum's debut, finished with 5 for 57 off 55 balls but the Black Caps only needed one further wicket or more for victory.

New Zealand were made to work hard in an effort to retain the advantage, but the batsmen were able to pull the ball over the line easily enough.

One day into the first Test, New Zealand were on the back foot in their attempt to win the match in Wellington. McCullum, who was unable to bowl in the first innings, bowled a no-ball to Williamson in the final over as the sides were locked at 1 for 200, and Williamson was sent by the bowler immediately.

New Zealand were unable to build up a significant target, and Williamson was dropped for the first time in the series as he was out caught behind point in the fourth over. Williamson ended up with 2 for 35 off 25 balls which included two consecutive fours to dismiss Nathan Lyon on the third morning.

New Zealand were forced to make several late changes on the second day as Ross Taylor, who started the day in the middle order, was dropped by Williamson and Kane Williamson replaced him in the top order as Grant Elliott was forced to bow out.
