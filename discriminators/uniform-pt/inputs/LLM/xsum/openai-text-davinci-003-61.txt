-day conference in Irbil, Iraq, that brought together top security officials from Iraq, the Kurdistan region and other countries.

Barzani said that IS would be defeated "an example of close cooperation between countries and when there is a will among these countries to cooperate with each other and exchange information." He said that if that happened, "you will see a very quick defeat of this terrorist organization within the next few months". 

Barzani called on the international community to come to the aid of those who are suffering under the tyranny of IS. He specifically cited the plight of minorities, including the Yazidis, as well as Iraq's embattled Christian community and the Turkmen of Iraq. He said that it was critical for the international community to increase its presence and provide humanitarian aid to those suffering. 

Barzani also urged the world community to ratchet up efforts in their fight against IS. He pressed for more coordinated action from Iraq and its neighbors, particularly in sharing intelligence and blocking the flow of fighters and funds across borders. He further said that, given the resources available in Iraq, the IS problem could be "totally eliminated" in a matter of months if only the world community fully engaged in the fight.
