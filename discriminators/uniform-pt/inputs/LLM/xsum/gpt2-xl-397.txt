That's because there were a number of injured internationals that could not play against England.

They include Wales' fly-half Rhys Webb, who was ruled out of the Six Nations with concussion and is out for the season through a spinal injury.

Also out are Wales forwards Aaron Jarvis and Dan Biggar, and midfielders Gareth Anscombe, Scott Williams and Dan Lydiate.

The team has been drawn in group D with the Italians and New Zealand, along with the other two southern hemisphere teams - South Africa and Argentina.

Scores are on 2 May at 17:15 BST, and again on 9 May at 15:45 BST (19:45 GMT).
