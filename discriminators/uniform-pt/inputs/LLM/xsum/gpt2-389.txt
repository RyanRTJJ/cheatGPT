 a national curriculum for children's school building to support better funding of primary school education.

Mr Powell has not made a formal ruling but said students wanted to know why the state should spend so much on education. "The education minister, in the summer she visited our schools, asked us how we could tackle the problem in our schools," he said. "The most important thing she asked came under her leadership and she had every reason to ask questions and she was right. We shouldn't be putting money on the table to help but instead look at ways we can help our communities."

Mr Powell is proposing to include new concepts of child learning, such as literacy, that will help kids learn to work in a world of work and financial independence.

Under the new curriculum the aim will look at children as they age, from first year to post-graduate level. It also proposes a "diversity scheme", a system of primary school schools which aims at ensuring there is a broad pool of highly trained, diverse children, particularly working class and economically deprived children, at all stages of life.

On a budget request, Mr Powell said the Department of Education is taking lessons from the findings of another review of secondary education.

Ms Powell has also been involved in the consultation process with local authorities whose communities need some form of education. The aim was to put money to help them in their capacity as school heads, to prepare the local government members to work in this area, and to identify areas where the Department of Education was doing some support by providing free local learning resources.

Mr Powell is proposing to take out about Rs 12,000 crore, from its existing budget of Rs 25,000 crore, from the Home Affairs (Home Office) and Transport (Transport) budgets. He has also recommended a range of other sources of funding to pay for private schools in his budget request. However, the Government cannot ensure that every step it takes
