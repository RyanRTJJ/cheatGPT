 National Museums of Scotland. The National Museum of Scotland got the rock as part of an agreement between it and the British government.

In March, 2009, an object found outside of the village of Geddes, near Gwynedd, Powys, was analysed, which showed it was made from the Moon's organic matter - the remains of minerals and a small amount of the lunar dust. In October, 2010, a piece of moon rock believed to be the Apollo 11 Apollo 17 LM was found while digging to dig the site for a new school, near Powys. Although the Lunar Module could be seen on the Moon, the discovery meant it was much closer to the Earth than usual when the Apollo 11 astronauts landed.

In March, 2014, the first object of a lunar disc to be spotted from orbit was discovered by a team from the United Kingdom, South Africa and France, in an orbiting telescope. The object is a rare example of a thin strip of lunar material called a basaltic iron meteorite.

The Moon is the closest celestial body to Earth in the solar system. It is the closest large planet to the Sun at distances of around 4.5 million kilometres, or 2.5 million miles, and orbits at a distance of just about 4 million kilometres from the Sun.

In 2011, the first object in more than 600 moons from the Moon was discovered by French astronomer Jacques Piccard using the Atacama Extremely Large Telescope on the Atacama Desert in Chile. It was the first known object in any moon that has any organic material.

In December 2016, the third lunar disc was found by the Russian Luna 1 spacecraft orbiting the Moon between March and June. It is a thin lunar disc that has a single tiny dark patch. It was discovered by the Atacama telescope by French astronomer Laurent GÃ©rard. The two previous previous lunar discs were discovered by the European Space Agency with
