"By giving an extra Â£12m to the Mayor's regeneration plan in Tottenham, we are giving a huge amount of investment back in our community," he said.

This summer saw the return of the Premier League as well as the return of the World Cup, with London becoming a football capital.

The World Cup was watched by 12.3million people, while football was played on a daily basis around the capital.

Tottenham had held the highest attendance in the Premier League with more than 18,000 on four occasions.

England's Euro 2016 triumph, which was their first major success after winning the Championship in 2016, proved that football was a force to be reckoned with after just 16 years on the continent.

The Premier League's new football fan survey by the Office for National Statistics found that 67 per cent of the footballing nations surveyed "enjoyed" visiting the country for their club's matches.

Over two-thirds of the world's major commercial leagues use official statistics - from the Football Association or the UEFA - to evaluate their own teams.

"All around the world, clubs are being judged on their performance in the league, as are fans and TV viewers," it continued.

"It is not surprising therefore, that when it comes to measuring how strong the British game is at home and abroad, people are beginning to make comparisons.

"If you look at the Premier League in particular, you will probably find that the teams in England's top flight enjoy the support of their fans even more than the countries they are competing.

"This is an indication of how keen football fans across the world are to see Britain - and especially Tottenham - prosper.

"And if you look at the data provided by the Premier League, you will recognise just how much this is the case.

"The London club holds the title for highest average match-going fan attendance and it goes to show the power of the sport in the country to inspire."
