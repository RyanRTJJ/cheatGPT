 prequel trilogy in its production run. This modern-day version of slavery took place in Africa and drew from three African stories as its focus: the abduction of the three women by General Sosamu, who took their virginity before having sex; the capture and rape of his wife by rebel soldiers in the bush; and the rape of a white woman by a rebel soldier. The movie uses the three stories in order to make a powerful effect on viewers.

The movie opens with an intense close-up, in which the camera focuses on Nena as she holds onto the chains on her feet, and Sosamu as he tries to run through the darkness, a silhouette between the lights of the world and what lies ahead.

Nena struggles to hold on to the chains, as Sosamu, who had given himself to her in marriage and was with her until he was betrayed by the rebels, is killed by what Nena thinks will be a suicide bomber. The movie goes back many months after this, to a time three years earlier, when all Nena wants to do is forget about Sosamu but her father, who is also the main protagonist, and his friend Dr. Okonkwo insist that she make a documentary on the atrocities of the rebels and their victims.
