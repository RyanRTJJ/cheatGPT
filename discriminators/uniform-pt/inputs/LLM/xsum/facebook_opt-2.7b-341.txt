32 BAE Systems's (BAES.L) aircraft simulators.

The plant, which will be called the Exeter Aviation Manufacturing (EAM) facility, will be used initially for general industrial manufacturing, including engineering, assembly and test work on aircraft, space crafts and missiles, and will later on be expanded to include engine maintenance.

The purchase of the SimTech Simulations company, for which the former BAE Systems also has a stake, is designed to improve GD's current capabilities and "build out its future capabilities", including the establishment of a "virtual factory" to build aircraft components.

The Exeter Factory, which will take over 500 BAE's sites for simulation and training, had already been bought by EAM - or was about to be - in a bid to secure a share in the defence business, which is part of General Dynamics' Marine Systems division. That bid included the £300m sale to EAM of existing facilities owned by BAE, and the building of a new factory at Ashford in Kent.

BAE's current facilities, which will have been retained in the sale, also encompass a simulator research and development centre, and a number of test flight rooms, test centres and avionics.

A spokesman for BAE Systems said the sale would enable the company to focus on the company's core defence business, and the purchase of the simulation group was part of that aim. "The company will retain an interest in the SimTech business, and so will retain management responsibility for the centre. SimTech has been a substantial contributor to BAE's military simulation business for the past 20 years."

General Dynamics said it had invested £200m in its Exeter factory, and that it will continue to grow the business.

The purchase marks a new dawn for EAM, which has taken over a number of BAE facilities in the past six years. In 2005 it was bought by EAM from Cattermole UK, which in turn had bought it from its former owner Northrop Grumman. Cattermole in turn got the company from GKN in 2003.

Earlier this month GKN announced its intention to sell EAM to General Dynamics, in a deal which could be worth up to £500
