 see what happens on Friday.""We had a difficult one against Italy, and he was really sore and wanted to get his injury right, so we left him out of it, and I know it's a concern that he's been injured. But the thing we have is good depth and I'm sure he will be OK, we'll leave it out there until Friday and see what happens.""That was not ideal for him, but he felt no rush, and I'm sure he'll be back in line for the England game."

I'm sure he'll be back in line for the England game."England have dominated the set-piece game and I think that's down to the quality of players they have in the frontrow and they have a big forward pack. I think that is what has helped England over the years."

England have dominated the set-piece game, and that is down to the quality of players they have in the frontrow and they have a big forward pack. They always do.

And they are good against the maul. If you don't believe me, have a look at their try in the final minute to kill the clock, how their man wins the second tackle, and how their player wins the third tackle. I know we used to pride ourselves on our scrum and line-out and so on, but they are right there as well.I wonder if he actually thinks 'they are better than us'.

And we cannot allow the English to get ahead in the set piece. It could cost us the game.

And they have a good backrow. That won't make up for the lack of front row depth, but if we get the maul, they get a penalty. England like to try and win the collisions by playing on the ground. We must win them off the ground by putting pressure on the ball

They have scored two tries in four games against us. We cannot let them get on ahead again.

And they have a good backrow. That won't make up for the lack of front row
