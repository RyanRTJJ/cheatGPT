 like the police, the criminals themselves could also risk jail.

Police chiefs have had to act more quickly in recent years, tackling more theft because of technological advances that allow police to monitor criminals even after they're gone.

The threat of losing this prized treasure is also growing in a few European countries. Thieves are increasingly targeting the Baltic coast, where the sea-borne wreck of the Dutch tanker Klyoski has not been found for nine years, and in Denmark, where looters last year kidnapped a Norwegian tourist from a boat off a stretch of the North Sea where ships are often wrecked.

The threat is so great, authorities are now considering an auction of rare archaeological artefacts at sea.

Mr White's mission, with the help of fellow archaeologists in Norway, is to develop an international protocol to protect artifacts stolen or illegally sold in the high seas.

"This is absolutely fantastic news," said David Biddle, a specialist in global commercial law at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. "There will be global attention. When people hear a vessel is under threat they will immediately do whatever is necessary to preserve it, because once we are in a situation of fear, people have no choice. But I worry that the only thing that will save historic items will be a global and international agreement, something like one that would also apply to the maritime environment."

He added: "There are just too many ways that we might damage our environment if we don't."

Mr White said he hoped that the International Maritime Organization, which organises the auction, would agree to help to create a uniform international standard on the laws of the sea.

A similar initiative in the United States is underway by maritime archaeologist Paul Molloy.

"We are a minority, a persecuted minority," he says. "But the tide of history is with us. We are not going to surrender
