 4% to £3.3bn

The broadcaster, ITV, said it expects a "modest" improvement in the UK television advertising market in 2016, predicting an increase of around 2%. 

It also expects to outperform the market, forecasting a 4% rise in domestic advertising revenue from £1.72bn in 2015.

The company said that total revenues in 2016 would be up slightly with cost savings offsetting a £50m predicted reduction in broadcasting costs due to lower football rights.

In January 2016, ITV said its net advertising revenue rose 3% in the fourth quarter of 2015 as its screening of hit period drama Downton Abbey helped boost viewing numbers for 2015. The channel also announced that total revenues for 2015 had risen 6% year-on-year to £3.3bn.

Looking ahead, the broadcaster said it will invest in "innovative programming, new content and technology" and make a number of structural changes, including a new chief operating officer.

ITV also recently announced a deal to buy UTV Ireland, a television broadcaster based in Ireland. The deal is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016.
