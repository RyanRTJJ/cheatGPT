biotics important to human medicine, as part of its long-term commitment to serve food raised responsibly. 

The initiative is part of McDonald's global plan to steadily reduce the use of antibiotics in its global chicken supply chain, with the ultimate ambition of transitioning to only use antibiotics that have been determined by public health authorities to be important for human medicine.

McDonald's has committed to phasing out the use of antibiotics important to human medicine from its US chicken supply chain by the end of March 2019. It has also worked to reduce human pathogen levels in its supply chain, as part of its responsibility in protecting public health from antibiotic resistance. 

McDonald's also works with its global suppliers on alternative strategies such as probiotics, encapsulated acids and bacteriophage technology to help address antibiotic resistance. These strategies reduce the need for antibiotics and improve food safety outcomes.

McDonald’s commitment will arrive first in the U.S. and eventually to other markets. By 2025, McDonald’s aims to reduce the use of antibiotics in its global Chicken supply chain. As global leader, McDonald’s will continue to work strategically with suppliers, experts and NGOs to help lead ongoing conversations in this space.
