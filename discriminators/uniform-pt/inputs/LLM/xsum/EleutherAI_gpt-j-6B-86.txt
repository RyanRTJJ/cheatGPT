 included in the SPL XI, but there could be four or five changes to the side.

Fifa.com already has the match officials in place for the match on Tuesday. The Referee will be Derek Beattie of New Zealand while the Fourth Official is Jon Ashton of Scotland. The Assistant Referee is David Kelly of Northern Ireland and the linesmen are Ian Stark of Scotland and Simon Gogia of Finland.

The referee will use a video assistant to check on the play in this afternoon's match, which will be streamed online by the BBC and Sky Sports, as well as online via the BBC Sport website.

Hearts will have another first team match on Wednesday, 8 April, when they travel to face Partick Thistle in the League Cup. This is the first leg of the second round tie and will be televised on ESPN in the USA from 7:30pm BST (5:30pm ET / 2:30pm PT).

Meanwhile, there has been an offer of solidarity for Robbie Keane, who scored a hat-trick for Ireland against Italy last night ahead of Sunday's Euro 2012 qualifier against the Czech Republic. The Hearts star tweeted after the game: "Well done Ireland, well done to the Irish nation, well done to Robbie Keane who won today by scoring against a world record for most teams beaten by Robbie Keane. Ireland can stop it now, they don't take on the mighty and win."

The offer did not go down well with many of Hearts supporters. They have since taken Keane to task to the 'Tut, Tut Man' Twitter account, which is run by a Hearts fan and regularly takes Tweets aimed at Robbie Keane to be printed. Earlier in the week, a tweet by the account said: "Robbie Keane is not a world record holder. He never was."
