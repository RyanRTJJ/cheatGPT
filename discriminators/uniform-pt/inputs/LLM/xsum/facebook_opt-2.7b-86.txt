 been told to return to London today and train with their Scotland colleagues.

As many as 14 of the 23 players called-up for Tuesday’s game have reported for duty ahead of Sunday’s Euro 2016 qualifier with Slovakia at Hampden Park.

Steven Naismith, James Milner and Michael Smith all trained today alongside Hearts manager Nigel Adkins, with the full squad continuing to train at their Tyndrum base, where further results of the tests will be known.

A Scotland spokesperson told BBC Scotland: “The match against Slovenia on Tuesday 12 April will be held as scheduled, 19:45. We expect the entire squad to be released to represent their country on Saturday 11 April for Slovakia at Hampden Park.”

Naismith, 28, is expected to be the first player to train with the Three Lions on Sunday, and could be joined by Milner, 30, and Smith, 24. Both are understood to have made themselves available for the match.

All players involved in the Scotland game will be involved in the Europa League play-off second leg at home to Spartak Moscow on Thursday, with Robbie Savage still suspended for Sunday’s game.

A few Hearts players left for London earlier this week but the club have been unable to confirm why they did so until now.

Sunderland manager Jack Ross is in Dundee to take charge of his club for the first time.

Hearts manager Nigel Adkins has seen his side beat Kilmarnock 2-1 in the Scottish Cup on Saturday to remain in the competition.

The game was played behind closed doors at Rugby Park due to ‘security concerns’ with the Scottish football authorities having come under pressure from Scottish political parties to ‘do the right thing’.

The football authorities, however, said that Saturday’s clash went ahead as scheduled.

The stadium and surrounding areas are still cordoned off while work is carried out on improving security in the area and there was no decision made over whether it would open to supporters.
