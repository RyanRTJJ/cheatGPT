 be completed in 18 months.

A full list of bidders was published as part of their tender for the study in September and was limited to four, with Jacobs being one of the four.

The others were Atkins, Balfour Beatty, and Skanska who are also involved in the Cross Rail project.

The Scottish government is looking at how the north west of Scotland, including Aberdeen, Cumbria - where a new rail link may be built over the Pennine Way, as well as the Lake District - can grow and prosper.

In an announcement on Tuesday (3 March), Transport Scotland said the decision to open the tender to an outside organisation "will help to accelerate the conclusion of the studies that are already underway and the delivery of transport solutions to the needs of the region".

Jacobs, which is currently involved in Cross Rail work for London-based transport consultancy Atkins, will be allowed to look at a wide range of transport issues, including rail and road upgrades, capacity needs for intercity and freight services, airport capacity and infrastructure links.

The scope of work will also be much broader than typical studies, with Transport Scotland now wanting the assessment completed in 18 months, rather than the usual 15 to 18 months.

A full breakdown of the details of the tender in September can be found here and the tender is open until 3pm on 23 April. The winning organisation will then be able to begin working on the study immediately.

A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: "The purpose of the study is to gather evidence and explore the many potential options for delivering solutions to the current and ever-growing challenges facing the Scotland South region.

"This will include identifying priority projects.

"The aim is to identify opportunities for delivering a network of road and rail networks across the south, creating and securing the future prosperity of these areas."

An Aberdeen City Council spokesperson: "With other organisations also seeking information, Jacobs is clearly in a strong position to deliver the key results Transport Scotland seeks.

"The short deadline will help accelerate the study and ensure it is as widely and fully-informed an assessment as possible."

The local authority has already raised concerns about the process, telling BusinessLive last week:
