 teams in 1999 and the sides of the previous decade's World Cups were from each of the 12 major US cities.


The current edition of the World Cup is to start in January.

In a message to supporters, Mabry told journalists: "I believe the World Cup will never be finished. It is the final of the World Cup. The whole game will only end after 15 years of development. Let's keep on building each World Cup. I hope the fans of South America won't stop."

The winner of South Africa's World Cup final has to be on the same side as the other players â€“ but this season the South African side have played on their own ground.


In South Africa, the sides can be expected to play in the same country at various stages but instead of being held on the same base, South Africa are going to play in four countries. They have been held on the same bases for the tournament at Wembley since 1993 due to the increased cost. The sides have also been held in New York, London and Paris since 2003.

Talks have been suspended and South Africa are said to be considering opening international competition in 2019.

A number of supporters are expected to flock north to watch this weekend's World Cup.


Meanwhile, a number of South Africans are set to travel across the world to watch the tournament.

This weekend, South Africa lost two of their two biggest matches. On Friday it suffered a 1-0 defeat at Ghana and in their last game came away victorious of the FIFA Group C championship.

They have been unable to progress past fifth place in Group C in South Africa, which came five years after they lost against Portugal.

This week, their side went to Italy, where Frosinone were 2-1 up against a very old, old squad which had been one of the only places to be played on the continent for four years.

If that fails, the club is seeking an exit from Frosinone and a move back into the USA.
