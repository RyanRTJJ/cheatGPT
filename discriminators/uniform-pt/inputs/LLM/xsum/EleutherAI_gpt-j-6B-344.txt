 to discuss the terms of the agreement. Meanwhile, the government has announced a nationwide ceasefire over the weekend and will gradually disarm remaining Farc guerrillas over a year-12 period.



This is the first time the government has offered an indefinite ceasefire to the Farc rebels, who say they will eventually lay down their weapons.



The peace agreement means that Farc will be obliged to declare permanent ceasefire, demobilise its 5,000 combatants, destroy its arms and hand over its land and territory to the government in a year-12 period.



The Colombian government will continue with the process of disarmament and demobilisation, dismantling its army and handing Farc fighters to the army for a "safe and human" transitional process.

Colombia President Juan Manuel Santos announced earlier in July that the government is ready to open a dialogue with the Farc on "national reconciliation". Farc has accepted to join a process aimed at "national reconciliation" but the group said that the negotiation talks should be suspended till the results of a new political survey are published.



A new electoral survey with the participation of more than 10,000 Colombians was carried about the conflict. A group of civic organisations and representatives of civil society were appointed to lead the political process to solve the conflict. On 14 July the government announced the participation of three representatives from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.



Santos said the new report was completed and would likely be revealed "in coming days", adding that "I think the government will adopt it, I think that (the report) could even be the basis for a new accord".



During the first round of peace talks on May 6, the UN-backed negotiation team failed to reach an agreement with the rebels in the latest round of peace talks in Havana. Negotiators in Havana were unable to reach an agreement to create a transitional government for former Farc rebels to demobilise and join mainstream society in the coming months.
