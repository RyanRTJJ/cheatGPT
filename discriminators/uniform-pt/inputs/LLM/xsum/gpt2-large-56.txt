Catholic pupils in the same area are not eligible. Some teachers had considered banning students who didn't live three miles from the school in a bid to curb the numbers coming from outside Flint.

The council-controlled schools were established because the previous local government was failing to build "sufficient schools" in the area.

In its latest budget, the council told families it had spent more than a tenth of its own money "raising or converting" schools, according to the state's governing authority, the Department for Education.

Other controversial spending measures include a move to strip £7m from schools with fewer pupils whose parents do not pay bills.

The Department for Education told the Guardian: "We are increasing the funding available to schools in areas of need for a wide range of school improvement schemes including free school meals, after school care and extra funding for pupils with special needs.

"We are also reducing spending on those schools that are unable to deliver on our commitment to improve education in their communities, with savings of £15 million coming from school building."

Flint council's education department said the move would save every child between three and 12 years old in Flint more than £60,000 a year.

The council has been criticised for spending up to £20m a year on refurbishing former schools in the area in just two years.

Last year it spent about £24m building schools at St Richard Gwyn, Wrexham and the school for the deaf at St Mary's, but only around £1.5m at St Mary's and the deaf school at St Michael's, both closed in February.

An independent reviewer has raised concerns about the way the county council is spending its money and said it needed tighter scrutiny.

Baroness Beeching, the national education adviser to the Department for Education, was expected to hold a meeting on the £40m spent on "distinctive projects" in the area early next month and it was expected to be agreed on the funding.
