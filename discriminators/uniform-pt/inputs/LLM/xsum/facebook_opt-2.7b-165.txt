 also found a beer would cost five times as much, on average the top ten destinations were all in the Mediterranean.

The researchers used data from the United Kingdom’s consumer price index to estimate consumer prices for goods consumed by Britons in 2017.

They found that in Spain the average cost of a beer was £3 while in Greece the average price was £7. A pair of jeans in the two regions cost £15.60 and £21 respectively compared with £29.70 and £41 respectively in Ibiza and the Balearic Islands.

A trip to the UK’s most expensive island of Ibiza costs about four times as much as in Sweden

The study also found a large part of the UK’s price difference was down to the fact that the country’s currency is worth less than several other European currencies – with the pound falling against most major currencies by around 13 per cent this year.

“Brexit has made everyday goods about 33 per cent more expensive for British people buying in their home country compared with when buying outside the UK,” the researchers said. “And that’s before anything is added in for taxes, and before any currency exchange differences are taken into account.”

Mr O’Neill said despite the rise in the cost of living many would argue “it hasn’t hit as hard as the media make out”.

And while Mr O’Neill said holidaymakers who did not go for a trip abroad would have to go for a longer holiday they would need to take more “trend setting” items with them.

For example, while he said a £20 T-shirt that was £8 a decade ago might seem like a bargain, now it would be more like £40.

“People have been used to it, people were saying you can live in the south-east for less than you can live in London,” he said. However a comparison to other Western countries showed the cost-of-living in the UK was actually falling.

“The difference is, even in the UK, real wages are falling,” he said. “[Wages] are falling around
