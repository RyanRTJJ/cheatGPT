 next target of 21 million, a goal that could mean reducing the number of under-fives dying for the next two decades.

Hanna is concerned about the impact of rising rates of social exclusion on the over half of women who live in poverty, saying: "And we have to make sure that we provide better care to the women who are being neglected within our community. And if that means that not every other woman lives alone at home, then that needs to be dealt with."

In 2012, the National Centre for Health Statistics put the number of under-fives in Britain at over 4 billion over the next five years, about one in every three under-fives. If the current level of under-fives being killed continues to climb, the risk increases to 14 million in 2016 from nine million last year when the National Research Council published its 'Crisis of the under-fives' figures

Over half of under-fives aged 24 years and over are women with disabilities, she says. They were less likely to be involved in the family business and to live in poverty after independence but were still more likely to have children than those with less-developed economic security.

And they were more likely to be in a minority race, a risk for women who were given the impression they were "normal" but with less power, she says.

"Women of all ages can be involved in family planning services where, as there are more women, it makes things more attractive for younger women to have their children," she says. "They have to be able to look out for their own well-being and find more positive ways to be able to do those things."

Her work as a counsellor in London's Hyde Park is taking its toll. Last year a group of local women working for the charity Childers found that they were nearly eight times
