 five-star hotel, a hotel complex under construction at Wandsworth Centre and a public park system at Mount Hinkle Park.

Killing The Nasty Man

While there will be no'super-hotel' - hotels or guesthouses based primarily on the value of existing land - the government is considering using existing land to build a one-stop shopping centre at Westfield.

That's what the state government is proposing in the area.

Construction will begin on the Westfield complex within three years and this development will be on the Wandsworth-Scooley site, with a third area set to open for the first time next year.

One of two new developments will be built on the old site.

Killer Design

The National Post has the first look at a two-storied design of building on the Nisqually site.

There will be a new public park and a number of new buildings.

Construction will be on track to begin two years later.

As the Nisqually area continues to deteriorate, people are worried about the effects of industrial developments on the area.

So far there have been no major developments. However it is unclear how long any project will last, if any at all.

Towards Better Infrastructure

The Minister of Infrastructure is also considering the development and construction of a massive new public school.

He is proposing to build six-metre high school on the old site, with its own private playground. Two high-speed trains will also be sent as part of the project, which is already under construction.

The government is also considering the acquisition of more land in the area to build a high-speed high station.

The site is expected to get a further four-star hotel by 2018-19.

Praising Tourism

For now, the Minister of Tourism is considering the development of a new hotel to be at Mt. Honington and the development of a new community centre at St. Catherine Park.
