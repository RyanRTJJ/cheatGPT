 a better diagnosis.

When they study older adults who do well with palliative care, he says, they often look for signs of Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's in the younger adults. The researchers were surprised to find that such symptoms did not include a loss of motor control, a loss in speech and loss of mobility that have been reported in patients who respond adversely to palliative care. The genetic differences between older and younger adults could help differentiate who is best able to manage the chronic pain of Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease or dementia.

The researchers also examined if there is a genetic component to both types of Parkinson's disease. They found no evidence of a direct link between a genetic predisposition and motor impairment or reduced activity. This finding was surprising because these diseases are associated with motor impairment among older adults, but it also suggests a biological component involved.

To find out if this finding holds for dementia, the researchers turned to two large Danish data sets. Each contains a large number of older adults who are currently living as a result of a disease or illness, sometimes called the dementia study cohorts. They are followed from 1985 to 2007 so that researchers can learn more about their health and cognition.

To get a look at patterns in the genetic makeup and pathways involved, the team used large-scale DNA sequencing of more than a million genes. In both cases, they created gene variants associated with motor function and found the most recent common DNA variants are tied to motor impairment. The researchers also assessed genetic variants in the brain that affect people's ability to change or develop a normal, progressive disease. This led them to identify the gene variants associated with motor dysfunction called the motor domain inactivation.

In order to explore how the genetic findings affected older people's symptoms, they measured movement on a scale of 0-100 and used an automated brain exam to determine their brain function and movement patterns. The researchers noticed that older people with more complex motor functions and a better motor response to medication had more motor impairment than the others.

This showed, too, that the combination of genetic and movement
