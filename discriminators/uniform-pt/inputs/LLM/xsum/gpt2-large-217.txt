Canada's team-mate, Ryan Burrough, was in the midst of a fine season, winning his eighth gold medal. He made an impressive return after a long layoff and posted an 8-3 record in five events, including a 4.29 performance in the steeplechase.

Burrough's bronze is Canada's fourth in Beijing, outscoring its opponents 7-5, and the gold victory marks the 18th straight in a competition the Canadians won on home soil.

Riders Tim Anderson, Sam Bennett, John Herdman and Brent Nance finished 10 seconds apart at the starting line, a record for any team in any event.

At times it looked like the Canadian women's team would be looking for gold, but the absence of Burrough ensured Canada would win their sixth Olympic event for the first time since 1992.

"It was great to see so many of our guys on the podium, and I love all those guys," Canadian coach Mike Sjostrom said, before adding that the country will remain focused on the men's team pursuit that has the potential to bring home the gold they've long craved.

Despite the fact that the men's team had an opportunity to improve their record going out of the blocks, Canadian sprinter Taylor
