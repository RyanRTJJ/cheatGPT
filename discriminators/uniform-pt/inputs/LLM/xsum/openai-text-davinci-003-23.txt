 dog bite injury to the person.

The force said it was left with "no alternative" after attempts to safely contain the animal failed.

The incident happened at midnight on Sunday in the Derwen area of Wrexham.

"No individual or group of persons should ever have to experience what happened on Sunday night and our thoughts are with the family," said a North Wales Police spokesperson.

The foxhound was owned by a third party, who had permits to keep it and had it under control earlier in the day.

"Unfortunately it appears that this control was lost and despite numerous attempts to safely contain the animal it could not be brought under control, leaving officers with no alternative but to use force to prevent further danger," said the spokesperson.

The force has launched an investigation and has liaised with the local authority.
