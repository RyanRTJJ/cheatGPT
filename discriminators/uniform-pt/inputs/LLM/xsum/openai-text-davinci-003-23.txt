The proposal was one of several measures aimed at making the 2018 F1 season more exciting, and it proposed giving drivers an extra, non-replaceable set of tyres.

The idea was that, at certain races, drivers would be able to make a single stop for fresh rubber and then have to conserve the tyres until the end of the race.

The intention was to encourage drivers to save tyres, rather than push too hard on a single set, which could potentially lead to some drivers out-thinking their rivals or risking a lap or two on old rubber to save on a pit stop.

However, investigations by Pirelli and analyses from the teams and the FIA have revealed that this approach could lead to too little variation in strategies, with everyone likely opting for the safe option, and reduced on-track overtaking.

As a result, the proposal has been dropped and was not included in the raft of changes announced today.

The changes announced were designed to reduce some of the complexity that prevails in F1, particularly as it relates to scope of parts and setup options open to teams.

The intention is to make the choices simpler, while at the same time keeping the cars competitive and the racing varied. Changes will come into effect during the 2018 calendar year.

In particular, the list of equipment and parts teams are allowed to use during a season has been trimmed, with certain areas closed off, while grid penalties for using extra engines, gearboxes and other components during the season will be halved to ten places per race.

The length of race strategies will be reduced from five tyre sets to three, while engine settings will
