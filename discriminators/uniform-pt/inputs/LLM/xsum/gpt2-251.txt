 from the sea creatures were being processed under China's strict "zero-tolerance" policy, and would be sent to the lab in Singapore.

Earlier this year the mainland's Fisheries Research Service (FRS) released a statement that said those caught in the "possible illegal activity by the sea" were being illegally harvested. The statement was prompted by the country's crackdown on illegal fishing and a Chinese fishing fleet.

"If we see you caught in the illegal trade or if you are caught in the illegal fishing act that is a big deterrent to any country that you will face fines or the removal of your right to life and health for a number of months but it has no impact on your livelihoods," said the statement.

The Chinese authorities in late August restricted the illegal hunting of pythons and sharks for 14 days, but did not remove them.

The sea creatures are not used in traditional Chinese medicine but China has long maintained their presence, saying it is for their good.

The animal was a favorite in the 1980s as a luxury medicine in hospitals, but has a difficult time being consumed in food. The population could fall below 12 million by 2030, and the country's population is estimated at over 400 million.

Pythons, sharks and other marine animals were used for thousands of years on China's Qinghai coastline before being transported into the sea to be consumed as a meat source in the late 19th century by European explorer George Columbus.

But today, the Chinese government has introduced new curfews prohibiting the consumption of sea creatures in the fishery.

The ban also applies to seafood processed in Shanghai and in some neighbouring Asian states.

Some fishermen have even tried to export illegally imported seafood in their homes.

"The international community has tried to reduce fishing activity in certain places and restrict the amount and source of seafood, but this is really nothing new and we could see that once the ban has passed over the sea areas will become more and more quiet," an Iduk University fisheries professor by the name of Yan Chen told the media on Wednesday.
