 though Mr Clark said in his letter that the firm's investment was vital. Under the TPP negotiations, that support could bring the tariffs up to three percentage points less than in the UK than was being negotiated. Under normal circumstances, one can imagine some countries being reluctant to pay more for British goods; after all, there's been a lot of debate over tariffs so far.

One potential problem from an Australian point of view will be that it is unlikely the Australian government would allow the TPP to be negotiated and enforced by local labour laws unless Australia agreed to open up its markets (with or without the UK). It's difficult to know how well this could work, but if the country's laws on workplace rights were compromised, it could have a nasty knock-on effect. Australia could also find itself being seen as being soft on corporate Australia, if we were under attack from a country that seemed to have more in common with its domestic consumer protections and labour law than that of the US. Such an outcome might be especially bad for Australia's business community, or its industry, for the TPP would give domestic multinationals an easier path to market power than many have dreamt of since negotiations opened in the early 1990s.

The TPP in its current form may not provide an enduring alternative to the US-EU Trade Agreement, but is unlikely to be the end-all, be-all to how the United States and its partners deal with trade. It's unlikely to be a model that would work in Europe, with countries such as Ireland likely to resist joining the US-EU trade agreement. Yet, because the TPP includes such issues as intellectual property, investor-state dispute settlement, and other trade pacts, there is some incentive — especially from American business people — to try and reach a settlement that does not undermine a good deal that will bring more stability to parts of
