 more than half the time is spent on other issues, such as health, business and education.

A Welsh government spokesman said the Welsh government would not respond "to the allegations made by the UKIP MEP", but claimed "the party has long advocated for an English electorate to replace England's regions". The spokesman warned that a split would "have a disastrous impact on the devolved administration, causing it to collapse and jeopardising our economy".

It's a case of having it (no doubt) and not letting go (more than likely).

The Ukip MEP also accused Mr Cameron of having "witnessed what happened in the UK" when the north was excluded from EU negotiations between the UK and the EU.

"This is a referendum election, not a coalition government," he continued. "The UK's borders must remain secure and a single market and Schengen remain viable. The UK's national interests must be at the forefront of any discussion."

The Welsh Conservative and Unionist Party has already distanced itself from Mr Farage's comments.

It is possible this isn't the first time the MEP has caused controversy.

In 2010, Mr Farage was filmed saying "they don't stand for anything, for anything at all.

"They didn't stand at the 2010 general election with any of them at all. They had no idea at all what they stood for. I could not have predicted anything at all about the outcome in this election."

When asked last year whether he was "really sorry", Mr Farage said he had "no idea".

He said he was not taking up the UKIP bid as he planned to make a full-time career out of a campaign that included opposition to gay marriage and the government's plans to curb EU immigration "to make sure there is no net gain by British workers in the rest of Europe".

The party has not said whether Mr Farage will stand again this year, or will not run in the general election.

If Mr Farage does not stand, Mr Cameron retains a strong chance of becoming Prime Minister and Mr Farage is thought unlikely to return to parliament.
