 had been cancelled.

The 24-year-old had suffered a near-fatal fall at the Ritz Hotel on Saturday while meeting her agent, who had a contract for the British singer to appear in a forthcoming movie.

After being discharged from hospital on Sunday, she appeared on the "Late Show with David Letterman" on the CBS network on Tuesday night.

But she told the audience that she hadn't been feeling well, had felt sick and would miss most of the show.

The singer, who had previously worked in a string of charity events in London, had previously had a successful career in Las Vegas, playing the role of Cher in "Cabaret", for example.

In addition to a successful career in Las Vegas, she had made several other appearances in the United States.

Following her fall, her tour of Australia had been delayed, as her ankle had swollen greatly.

In a statement, she continued to wish all her fans that she would soon be back "on stage in the flesh" at her Sydney, Australia concert, which is set for March 3rd.

As she continues her tour, she is reportedly preparing to record an album in January, which is expected to include material from her recent tour.

She and her sister, Melanie Dallen, have been very active with their online support of people with Aspergers, a form of autism.

Her sister has a disability which is a form of Autism Spectrum Disorders (Asperger) herself. They are also the owners of a website called "My Little Pony in Love" which gives a voice to people like them.

Her father, who had died from complications of stomach cancer in 1989, was named by her as a friend of the stars of the Broadway musicals "Cats" and "Grease", and the television series "Frasier". His brother is the conductor of the Canadian National Symphony Orchestra and his son, Mark Dallen, an actor, producer, writer and director.
