 Secretary of Social Welfare Lovely Renéé Castro Reyes was also removed from her post for alleged failure to prevent the tragedy.

At least 41 girls died in the blaze at the facility in the Guatemalan capital on 8 March, with around 20 injured by smoke inhalation and burns. More than 600 teenagers were staying there, many of whom had arrived from rural areas and poorer homes. 

The fire broke out in a wooden annexe which was attached to the main building of the girls' home. Investigators alleged that the blaze was caused by firewood placed near an open flame and poor maintenance. Since then, the Virgen de Asunción home has been closed and the teens have been relocated to other shelters. 

The three suspects could face up to 25 years in prison if found guilty of manslaughter, abuse and exploitation of minors, and serious negligence while managing public funds. 

The Guatemala Shelters Commission -- an independent body formed after the fire to manage the closure of the home -- is currently investigating the case, and the prosecutor has been tasked with completing the investigation and gathering evidence from witnesses. The group is also looking at setting up a financial commission to manage funds for the victims. 

The tragedy, which sparked national outrage, has led to calls for transparency and accountability in the way shelters are managed. The government has promised to increase oversight of such homes and better care for the minors housed in them.
