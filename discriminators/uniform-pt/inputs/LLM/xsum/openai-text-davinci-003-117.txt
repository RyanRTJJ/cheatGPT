"probably" the biggest threat to the UK.

The advice to focus more on France as an adversary was contained in a report by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's external advisory panel in 2011.

It said: "France has more of a hard-headed understanding of national interest, and a greater readiness to push its interests through diplomatically and militarily, than the UK."

The report said that France was "arguably the most important counterweight to the UK in Europe".

It added: "France is the European power most likely to push back effectively on UK policy. It has a larger standing army and appears more willing to use it. It is also increasingly bold in its preparedness to use economic and financial levers abroad."

The panel warned that the UK needed to think much more strategically about the balance of power in Europe, and to be more proactive in promoting its own interests.

The report concluded that there was spillover from the UK's relationship with France, and that improved understanding of the French could serve the British government well.

Mr Fraser, who was Permanent Under Secretary at the FCO until 2011, said there had been a shift in focus from the previous bilateral relationship with France to one of "managing differences".

He told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee: "The French will argue one thing; we will argue another. We could come to a right resolution or we could clash â€“ that is a normal part of international relations when two countries have differing interests which are not easily reconciled.

"France is one of our closest partners in the EU and it also certainly one of the most powerful players in the EU and importantly its also probably the biggest threat to the UK or one of the biggest threats to the UK
