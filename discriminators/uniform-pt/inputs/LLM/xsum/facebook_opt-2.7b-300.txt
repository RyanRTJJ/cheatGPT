“We’re excited about the potential and possibilities of this technology,” said Dr. George Yannopoulos, vice chairman of the Penn Engineering Department of Polymer Science and Engineering.

“The potential is to do interesting things with plastic that are unique from anything else on the market. The main thing we’re interested in is the ability to stretch the material to its limit,” said Yannopoulos, who is heading a four-person team of PhDs, graduate students and undergraduate research associates.

Drilling out plastic

To stretch and flex plastic, the team uses molecularly modified carbon nanotubes and carbon nanophotonic wires to anchor and position the nanotubes at different points in the polymer film. In this way they are “drilling out” the plastic to control how much plastic is left in each bottle, according to Dr. Gokhan Kalkan, a chemical engineering PhD student in the Penn Engineering Department who is also a member of the team.

The nanotubes are anchored at specific points in the inner, plastic plastic sheet. When the fluid is pumped in, the nanotubes expand to pull material out, making it easier to squeeze.

This plasticized material is useful when the plastic is in a tight container, such as a disposable plastic bag, because the material absorbs the liquid, making it less sticky.

“For things like plastic bags,” Yannopoulos said, “the thing that makes them so sticky is their oil content. If we make the bag more rigid, the oil can be drawn out.”

And the team is also exploring how the material could affect other types of flexible containers.

“We’re able to put a bunch of these nanorods in a flexible bag and change the stiffness of that bag,” Dr. Kalkan said. “So you can get things that are stretchy, but have a particular stiffness.”

Dr. Yannopoulos hopes to use the material for more than consumer products.

“It would be great to see this developed for things like bio-sensors or sensors to take temperature measurements
