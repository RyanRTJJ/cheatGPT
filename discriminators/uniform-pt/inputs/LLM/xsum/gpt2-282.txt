-3S, a prototype of the aircraft, also used a software flaw, Boeing said, because only 20% of the time, the autopilot was unable to properly manage the flight instruments and it could not perform several tasks. "But this was a problem, and we thought that we were about as good a solution as we get." Other problems were with the navigation systems, which were damaged and too small to be deployed properly. "These are the common features of Airbus (H) III, which we had a hard time dealing with," the head of the FAA's aviation safety section said Monday. One of the problems, Boeing said, was having to use a proprietary tool developed by the firm's partner for managing flights. That tool was developed by a company called QQ Technologies called XS and uses an Intel 815 processor. Airbus has been working on the tool since Sept. 25. Airbus's head of industry security, Mark Fenton, has since spoken publicly on the company's own website that "EJ is no longer working with the QQ Technologies team." This means that Boeing had to come up with its own solution. "In the end, they decided to use the same approach they had of moving the QQ Technologies team from their own company to QS," the Boeing chief said. But the Airbus chief pointed out that Airbus was now taking steps to "fix the problems they suffered in the first place." With that, he said, Boeing's "continuing efforts to improve the reliability and speed of its airplane are continuing." "As you can see from the first meeting, we are very pleased with what we've achieved and can continue to improve as Airbus strives to provide the aviation vision we need," he said. "That's why we're using the same tools we have found in other aircraft." Airbus has since developed other software and systems, such as GPS, in the wings to provide aircraft with a longer, more "precise and comfortable" cockpit, Boeing's chief aeronautics of engineering Mark Davis said, pointing to a range of options, including improving fuel use by using less fuel instead of
