 lawsuit didn't have standing, the entire litigation effort would be thrown out.

A lower-court ruling in May said in part: "Businesses do not have standing in a lawsuit where they are unable (directly or through their agent) to demonstrate that they will suffer harm from a claim of discrimination."

On Thursday, the Supreme Court's nine-member court unanimously rejected the business owners' request to review a U.S. Court of Appeals which had upheld the lower court's dismissal.

The court said the two-judge panel didn't have "any basis for concluding that a plaintiff must show actual 'direct' injury. Indeed, even granting review of the merits of the merits would create a new standing issue."

The Supreme Court's decision Tuesday means that the lower-court decision would now be reviewed in the Fourth Circuit.

The federal court in St. Louis, which included a former U.S. attorney and had an appointed attorney general, ruled that business owners did not have standing to sue over discrimination, saying they only received a complaint.

"Notwithstanding the district court's rejection of plaintiffs' position that they have standing to sue over disparate treatment, a plaintiff has standing to bring a claim if he or she can demonstrate a real (direct) injury (such as loss of employment) attributable to a discrimination claim," the court said.

Under U.S. law, businesses are not eligible for any legal funds for discrimination claims, but an additional provision grants standing only to the government or to individuals within the government.

The lower-court judge said businesses that had suffered discrimination had to show that employees were made to perform tasks that violated their religious convictions.

According to the government's attorneys, none of those attorneys were involved in the case and had no involvement in the original decision to deny the businesses' motion for review.

The suit was filed in 2015 in St. Louis County by the Freedom From Religion Foundation against the St. Louis-area United Church of Christ. The suit said the church violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition of government establishment of religion and the Missouri Constitution's protections for individual liberties.

The suit named the U.S. Civil Rights Division, the Equal Employment
