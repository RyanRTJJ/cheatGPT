1. And second, that controversial supermarket "land banking" (buying land cheap then selling it on for development) might in the long run prove even more profitable than most people think.

We are not supposed to do this!

It's called, ‘development with planning permission”, and its illegal to do. Here you are being told to do it by the government and the planning department that has been going out of their way to make the whole planning process difficult, and almost impossible at times to even follow in the first place. Its illegal to build on land that has been sold to another party for development without the consent of the land owners with planning permission.

2. I love that, you would think this is a good thing, but its not. People who have been in the planning process have to submit a statement of benefits (sometimes called an impact statement) to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which is given to local authorities and community groups. You are warned by the department that you will not be on the list to hear your case in court, and told that if your case is successful it becomes “binding”, but that if your case is not successful, it loses its binding force.

It means you could lose your benefits, or any chance of re-ferential to future benefits, because your case was not successful. This means that the department can take away the benefits of those who have applied to live in rural or deprived areas, people who live in more deprived areas because of their socio-economic characteristics. Or put another way, if the department cannot take away your benefits, it can force you out of the rural economy and even forced you to sell any plot of land you owned that you had been planning to live on, or they can choose who to buy the land they want to build on. As it is often the case that there are very large developments or large development, they are more likely to take the planning law
