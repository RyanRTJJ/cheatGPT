 rape one of them, and told a woman who tried to alert a friend a few days before the attack that he was responsible - and he raped her in front of a horrified group of people. He was jailed for 13 years and nine months after admitting four sex offences. But it is a different story for three women in Birmingham - and one woman in Coventry who have alleged they were raped after meeting him at night clubs. Mr Khatkar, who was also convicted of 10 offences involving false imprisonment and three rapes, was sentenced by Judge Richard Davenport QC on Thursday. Khatkar admitted five counts of rape and one count of false imprisonment in August last year. He claimed in his interview that he was "bored" one night, and that he "snapped" in reaction to an "upgrade". But as he tried to walk away, one woman tried to block his path. "She was really very brave but he attacked her in the street," he said. "She was wearing high heels... and she was holding onto a tree and trying to pull him away from me." The judge described the attack as a "violent incident". The woman in Coventry declined to comment on her claims, but told the court she had been talking to Mr Khatkar after she had met a friend at the Queen's Club and were "intoxicated". Mr Khatkar had told her that he lived nearby, and that she made a sexual advance and she didn't react, the court heard. She told him not to go to her house, and she was sitting on her front steps when she was raped by him. "She was a very young woman - maybe 20 years old - and she couldn't say a lot of things - there were no words to describe what she was feeling," Mr Khatkar said. "She was really scared." He
