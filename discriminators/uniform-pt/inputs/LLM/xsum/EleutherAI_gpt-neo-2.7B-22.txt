 at Gatwick have been cancelled.

A further 15 Gatwick flights were unable to take off this morning because of a technical glitch leaving passengers waiting 15 minutes for aircraft to arrive at the airport.

Budget carrier Easyjet, which covers more than 20 million passengers a year, had previously said: “We work closely with the airport authorities and our flight crews to ensure an adequate service.

“A delayed flight due to a technical issue is never a good sign. We will update this morning’s flight times when we know the exact cause of the delay, but that’s typically only with the arrival of an aircraft.”

Passenger rail services serving Heathrow were also affected following an announcement on the airport’s twitter page: “Due to technical reasons our rail services to Heathrow were cancelled today. All services back to Paddington stations remain operating normally.”

Heathrow has been working to alleviate the crisis caused by the disruption, with passengers told they should either rebook or wait until the service returns to normal.

The airport has told passengers it is looking at installing additional capacity to handle any delay, a spokesman told The Independent: “The Government and the Department for Transport have identified options in the event of airport closure so we are looking into ways Heathrow can continue to serve passengers with additional capacity in the event of a closure.

“However, the option we have identified will entail taking longer to get to London and passengers are being consulted on this option. Should there be insufficient capacity the Government will provide alternative airport support in due course.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Transport said: “The UK’s airports play a vital role in connecting people to our country. A lot of UK travellers come to the UK for work, education and holiday. The aviation industry contributes £34 billion to the economy, supporting 300,000 jobs and generating around £3.7 billion of annual tax receipts.
