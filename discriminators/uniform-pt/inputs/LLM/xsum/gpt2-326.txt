 14-year old girl and five children.

On Monday, police confirmed they had identified the woman as 19-year-old Shirea Daley.

The man, aged 32, has been arrested on charges of attempted murder, abduction and dangerous driving.

Police initially said it had been determined that he had just been driving past an area called Cairn Street when the car struck. A forensic examination indicated he had fled the scene of the crash, Irish Times reports.

In a statement, the force said: "Detectives with the Irish Forensic Society and other professional forensic teams attended the incident and identified the missing young girl at the scene on Cairn Street.

"We await further information from the authorities and our investigators will also continue to examine evidence in relation to the victim."

Fianna FÃ¡il, the umbrella organisation representing residents, has issued a statement, also demanding that the party take a "strong stance in solidarity with the victims".

It said: "We are deeply distressed that the incident has occurred and the police are now continuing the investigation at an advanced stage to establish the cause of his death."

The Irish Independent's Matt Murphy also reported from Dublin.
