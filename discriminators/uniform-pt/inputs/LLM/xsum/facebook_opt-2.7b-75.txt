 Bill to force unions to allow their members to strike. At a time when workers' wages are stagnating and employment has reached its lowest level in four decades, it could end up having a devastating impact on millions of workers."The Scottish government must speak up and take a lead in opposing legislation which would give the UK government power to break the law and impose penalties on trade unions, without any input from MPs and with no accountability to members. It appears to be part of an agenda to use government legislation to break unions in the UK - and to further the Conservative party's agenda of making it harder for workers to organise."The bill is being rushed through parliament without any consultation or public debate. This is happening despite the fact that a number of trade unions have rejected the government's 'one size fits all' approach, and a large majority of trade unionists and people across the UK reject the idea of breaking the law through secondary legislation."

The Scottish government has said that it would oppose a so-called secondary bill introducing such legislation, but we are now calling on Nicola Sturgeon to ensure the Scottish voice is heard on this issue."If Scotland is going to have its own constitution and rights, we must have control over our institutions and policies. We need to take a clear stand. We should not let unionism be eroded because UK politicians and ministers don't like what is happening overseas. We must not roll over and accept the imposition of something so unacceptable. This government's actions must be opposed and the Scottish government needs to take a strong stand on such laws."
