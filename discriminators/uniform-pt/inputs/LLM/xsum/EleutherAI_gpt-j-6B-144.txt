 and Clyde said the practice has now been put to an end.

Children were only being given low power laser equipment after they had been sedated and were fully conscious, the health board's chief executive said yesterday.

However, the health board admitted that this "unacceptable" practice was being carried out for the time being. The problem was first brought to the board's attention a week ago. The inspection team from NHS Quality Improvement Scotland visited the clinic on March 7.

The inspecters noted a problem with the procedure: "During the visit we found that staff were using low power CO2 lasers to clean nasal and oral equipment on children who were only sedated enough to allow the clean to be done."

The board stated yesterday: "In the past, this has been carried out on anaesthetised children who are then conscious whilst the procedure is being carried out."

NHSGGC clinical director, Dr Jim Gallagher, explained that children were only being sedated on an "emergency" basis and not "as a general practice". "The issue is that when the anaesthetist is ready to go, the laser equipment has to be switched off. It can only be on for a minute," he said. "It is not something that is a normal part of practice and it is not something that is part of our standard safety protocols."

When asked whether children might be at risk if they were conscious whilst being cleaned after being sedated, Dr Gallagher replied: "One of the first reactions is 'how could this ever cause harm?' but the fact it is even happening should be a sign of concern. It is not acceptable under safety protocols."

It transpired during the visit that the procedure was occurring on two days of the week and that the nurses in charge did not know that this was happening. Health visiting teams are now informing parents and grandparents of the change in practice. Further investigations are being carried out to discover why the policy change was not put to the health board at an earlier date. The board's senior nurse manager was out on sick leave last month which
