 extent of the damage and the oil slick, having been dispersed by weather and tidal movements, had no immediate environmental effects.

Oil slicks are a hazard to marine life and a significant hazard to bird migrants. The oil slick from the MS Braer was seen at first light as a vast black area of oil on the waters between Wick and the isles of Scarpay and Stronsay. The ship's captain estimated a maximum of  of crude oil on the ocean at the time of the grounding. The area surveyed was about 30 hectares in extent.

The ship ran aground off Scarpay and Stronsay on the morning of 5 January 1993. Only some of the birds appeared to have been killed. The oil slick was seen by boat observers. The Shetland Times reported that the incident could lead to tighter regulations on the discharge of oil, with the possibility of more stringent measures being put in place. Within an hour the weather was very bad. Some bird kills were thought to have been caused by flying objects. By 7 January the oil slick had widened considerably but had no immediate effect on the local birds.

By 9 January the Shetland Times quoted experts who doubted that the birds had been killed and suggested that the birds which died probably died from flying into the slick. The effect of the slick on migratory bird numbers was expected to be minimal; the birds that had flown through the slick had probably carried the oil with them and not dispersed it in the atmosphere.

A total of about 85,000 tonne of crude oil was discharged while the Braer was aground, and some 25,000 tonne were estimated to remain on the ocean floor.
