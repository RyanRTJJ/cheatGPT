 Goodison Park on Saturday.

"We are going to be playing the Saints," he said after he picked 13 players for his first match since returning from a groin injury. "We wanted to play with three at the back, to be a bit more creative again, but against a side like Liverpool with their ability to cause people problems you really have to keep your head on a swivel."

The Swans have scored 12 goals this season, but Clement said they were now looking forward to Saturday's tie.

"I wanted my team to look after their feet," he said. "So that means we have to make sure we can't have the slightest drop-off.

"So if [we can] put the same energy we could have at half-time then come to the game after half then that will be important to us.

"There will be lots of pressure on us because if Liverpool can get a goal then it's going to cost us. But we want us to get our results. We won't let Liverpool give us three easy goals."

As for the injury to Daniel Sturridge, it is still only a few days since he suffered the setback that has left Liverpool striker Luis Suarez in search of a fresh start at Camp Nou.

Clement is confident the 24-year-old will be in contention to start his Liverpool comeback after being sidelined by a hamstring problem.

"There is a slight chance. It's just training to be 100 per cent. Now when he wants to participate in full training he should be able to," he said.

"We're not going to use him to break an ankle like we did when he was injured. It was a few weeks later that he broke his leg but we're not going to do that with Sturridge."

Clement, who has signed goalkeeper Brad Jones and midfielder Scott Parker to his squad for the trip to Anfield, praised the work of the Academy system that he has overseen at Swans Stadium.

"I'm delighted with our academy
