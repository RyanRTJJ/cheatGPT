The game, which featured the home side leading 7-4, started brightly with two tries in just 18 minutes.

Gareth Anscombe crossed from five metres out to score with a breakaway before the Scots had a penalty saved after a knock-on.

Liam Williams slotted home a penalty to put the hosts ahead before the break, only for Scotland to go in level again after a penalty was awarded when George North went down under pressure from Alex Dunbar.

There was a late scare for the visitors when prop Rory Hughes went down under the attentions of Dan Briel and was treated on the field by nurses before his replacement, David Denton, replaced him.

The Lions lost full-back Jonathan Davies to a concussion and there were several late scares for the Scottish forwards, but Hogg was on hand to fire his side into a lead at 2-0 in just nine minutes.

Scrum-half Gethin Jenkins - who made his debut against the Lions in 2009 - showed great vision to find the corner with a breakaway to set up Hogg to run through the Irish defence, the hooker charging through a gap before lifting his arm and making the simplest of touchline-to-touchline touches.

Hogg was in the form of his life, darting through the middle and scoring his eighth try.

Lions scrum-half Rob Kearney then brought down Williams at a ruck and the Welshman received a yellow card - Ireland lead 9-9 in the 50th minute.

Both sides then came close to going ahead when Williams went under the posts as his kick bounced away from Hogg's feet.

The hosts tried an early lineout but Ireland won the kick and Hogg
