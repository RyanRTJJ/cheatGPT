 $16.3-million high school on the Southwood school grounds.

It will house up to 600 students and will be called Woodside Secondary.

Speaking about the school, Mr O'Dowd said it was important new schools are placed outside the centre of town because rural students need to see what other options might be available to them, if they don't like life in Timaru.

"Rural students don't get the opportunity to see the rest of the country at their doorstep in Timaru. They go to the regional high schools because they want to get an experience of what the rest of the country is like, what the other options are," Mr O'Dowd said.

"This will provide that opportunity."

After a public exhibition last month, Woodside Secondary was chosen from among several strong applications.

Woodside will have the same design as other schools being built in the area, and can accommodate as many as 1,800 students.

Mr O'Dowd said the Government knew of strong communities in areas like Timaru, where people are happy living.

Phase two of the project, due for completion in 2019, will see the construction of an elementary school at the existing Timaru Boys High School site - the land will be sold to a third party, to be determined.

The school will accommodate about 500 students and will be called Timaru Girls High School.

It is aimed at students living on the eastern shore of Lake Dunstan.

The government will also spend $18.3 million on a new primary school at Mokaitore, at the Mokai School of Sport.

The schools follow the release of government funding guidelines announced to the public on November 12.

The public exhibition process was not followed by an invitation to media, but the public did get to see the sites during a tour on November 12, and a media conference held on December 3.

More than 100 applicants attended the media conference, where their applications were put to the Minister.

Mr O'Dowd said phase two was the first of the five schools in the north to be funded and the others would be built once phase two was completed.
