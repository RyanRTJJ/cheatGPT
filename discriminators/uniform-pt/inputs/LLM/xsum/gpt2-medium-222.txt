 to show up for work. He had returned to his home shortly before 3am. His remains were found in an undergrowth surrounded by dense wooded vegetation in Forest Park, Kent, near Sandown.

Davies was described as a full-time father and a dedicated pupil. He was in his early forties and originally from Northampton. Police believe he may have lost contact with his family after his car was found on June 15. Investigators are appealing for anyone who saw Davies on Monday 10 May. He is described as Caucasian, five feet eight inches tall and thin and with medium-brown hair. His voice should be able to be heard through the thick undergrowth.

He could still be seen wandering around with a pair of white gloves at around 8.30am yesterday. Detective Chief Superintendent Louise Williams said: "We are urgently appealing to the public for any witness information which could assist Detective Chief Superintendent Williams' enquiries into the disappearance of Mr Davies.

"Officers at all levels are urgently searching for Mr Davies and we are asking anyone who can shed light on his disappearance to contact officers." She also urged anyone who may have seen Mr Davies in the forest area where he was last seen on Monday 10 May to contact police. The incident was being treated in the same area as Mr Curnock's abduction, which is believed to have taken place on 2 May. Police are carrying out further inquiries with a view to reopening Mr Curnock's case over the next week to further consider whether he is missing or has come back to the area.
