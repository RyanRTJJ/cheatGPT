 by more than a quarter to 42.5 per cent from 65 per cent.

The figures were obtained as part of a Freedom of Information Act request by the party. The NHS said it had no role to play.

Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said it showed just how difficult the NHS is to run.

He said: "We are seeing a situation where the patients' health is on the brink of an absolute disaster. The NHS is struggling to cope with increasing pressures on services including GPs and hospital departments.

"If Labour is elected, we will see action by central government to stabilise this deteriorating situation which is leading to serious consequences for patients."

The Glasgow data, which was obtained by the Labour party, is based on data from the National Audit Office.

The party said it found three of the top six hospitals that had the most patients admitted in November were located in the capital.

The figures also showed that just 11 of the top 22 hospitals, a third, showed a patient wait of more than 10 days. More than two thirds of hospital admissions in November were for general practitioners.

The Labour party wants to see a new round of cuts in the budgets of the NHS, with some health boards already facing pressure from the Department of Health as they prepare for the next round of austerity.

Jeremy Corbyn's campaign launch was held in the old Royal Infirmary.

However, the event, which was held in the old Queen Elizabeth II Hospital, was attended by thousands more than previously expected. His rival, Liz Kendall, is to meet with patients who face long waits to see a GP.

Mr Corbyn criticised the government for allowing the health service to take a pay cut rather than investing enough funds in the service, saying that if the NHS in England was given the Â£834bn budget commitment, "many, many more NHS workers would be safe and safe could they get off work".

He criticised the Conservatives, saying they would instead spend billions "on a new arm to police schools".
