Gray was pulled over in July and charged with driving without a license. A video from the scene shows Gray being put inside a police cruiser after an officer says Gray “physically resisted.” Gray then appears to lose consciousness after officers begin to lift him up. A prosecutor said Gray, 25, died from severe spinal cord injuries that were sustained in the vehicle ride.

Two other officers, William Porter and Garrett Miller, were tried and acquitted in December for their roles in Gray’s arrest by the Metropolitan Taxi Board. Porter testified at the trials that Gray became unresponsive while being put inside the patrol car and officers moved to lift Gray onto the back seat as he began to shake. Gray’s injuries were “traumatic and prolonged,” and he suffered from “mental distress and emotional distress” while in custody, Porter said during testimony. Miller testified that officers lifted Gray “for as far as they could” to no avail.

On Thursday, Mosby updated the charge sheet to the second-degree murder count but still refused to announce the grand jury findings that the other officers will face a third trial for charges of failing to tell their supervisors that Gray appeared to be becoming unresponsive.
