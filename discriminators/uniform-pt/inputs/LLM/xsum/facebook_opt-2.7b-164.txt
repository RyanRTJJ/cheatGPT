 lost their semi-final by 18-12 against Australia, play Australia next on Saturday 28 June at 11:30 BST

Women's World Cup coverage on BBC Sport has won the gold audience share award at the TSB Digital Media Sports Awards.

BBC Sport beat out the Sky Sports network for the biggest viewing audience in a 24-hour period, when Canada beat New Zealand in the semi-final rugby test.

The UK audience for England's football win over Colombia was also the highest ever for a World Cup match.

BBC Sport attracted an audience of 39 million viewers on Thursday - just below England's winning goal against Columbia.

England's semi-final was also the nation's biggest television audience for a women's match since the England Women's World Cup win in 1991.

It was also a record high for an England women's home match at Wembley with an average audience of 4.5 million.

And an average audience of 1.2 million tuned in to watch England's 15-12 win over Colombia, which had a record viewing audience of 6.9 million on BBC One.

In a category that recognises the quality of the work done across the network, the BBC won in the 'Digital Brand' category.

The TSB Digital Media Sports Awards aim to showcase the best of British digital media. The awards - held on Friday in London - were part of a week-long festival that celebrated British sport's technological prowess.
