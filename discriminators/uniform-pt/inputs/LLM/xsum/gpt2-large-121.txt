's "unlikely that the current rate of infections is an indication of a continued problem in the community.

The PHE also said the rate of HIV cases was nearly 50 percent higher than in the previous two seasons.

According to PHE, the infection rate for the 2017-18 season is predicted to be between 15-22 infections per 100,000 people, and will rise further in the next two years under current and planned HIV and TB prevention policies being implemented across the country.

PHE also pointed to the low success rate of the public health response to HIV in Liberia as an indication that the country's HIV/AIDS epidemic is not being adequately addressed.

According to the PHE, the disease has not been effectively controlled in Liberia since 1998 when the country achieved a low HIV prevalence of 3.5 percent, at the time it ranked lowest in the number of new HIV infections and third from lowest in the amount of new HIV infections.

The PHE said while the number of cases is increasing there is an overall trend for higher transmission of HIV from male to female, especially through sexual transmission, and an overall trend for decreased transmission of HIV from women to men.

As of May 2017, there are 4,621 suspected cases of HIV and 974 suspected cases of TB diagnosed in the community. The WHO says there are 13.8 million people living with HIV and around 13 percent of the total population is expected to have the sexually transmitted diseases in 2017.
