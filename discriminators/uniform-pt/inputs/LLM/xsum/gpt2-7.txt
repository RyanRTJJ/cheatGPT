 with the matter."

"The issue of violence, this year, was a bigger surprise than it would have been otherwise," said she.

She also told the BBC he did not believe the "white-clothed woman" being interviewed was a "white supremacist, any more than other left-wing journalists are white supremacists," and she was "completely fine" with the interview.

While the media had been waiting for years for news to report on the case of a black 19-year-old missing from a white South Korean town of Chonghwa, it "had already begun the long process of finding out," said a spokesman for South Korea's Information Ministry.

There is no sign the story could have gotten out in time as the case was being investigated by the police.

"What we're seeing right now is that the police are not giving a fair assessment, but they have no jurisdiction over the facts. They will not allow you to have an independent opinion, even when that opinion could have changed the outcomes," she said.

Ms Curham said she believes the BBC is biased in its coverage and her team should focus on educating public, rather than on "white supremacists" being responsible for the black missing.

The BBC and Radio 4 News both apologised to the two journalists who were interviewed for their reporting.

But another organisation, the Global Media Council (GMC), took aim at Ms Curham's claims, writing that her assertions were "silly and unsupported":

It is important to note that this year's black press event is very different from the 2011 anniversary of the disappearance of Kim Jong Un. For the first time any black reporter can be interviewed by the BBC.

In July, BBC reporter Nick Davies was attacked at a London bus stop for asking about the possibility of being shot at in North Korea.

This case should be a wake-up call that North Korea is not in the public eye and we need to move more quickly to stop this dangerous regime from acquiring nuclear weapons.
