 mild symptoms - not fever.

Health officials said earlier this week they could have more than 30 more cases if more people had tested positive in Florida.

Health officials said there has also been a spike in suspected cases of Zika virus in Miami and other South Florida cities, with many patients coming from Brazil and Peru.

People have been sickened earlier this week in multiple cities in the US - one in San Jose and one in Fort Lauderdale.

A new WHO advisory on sex-positive Zika virus cases published in February said it would soon investigate cases in North Carolina and Mississippi, and that an additional nine cases in Florida will be included in the update later this month.

Last week, the International Agency for Research on Cancer said Zika virus had left about 7,000 people infected with the virus in one year, and that the epidemic was expected to continue in the rest of the world.

The WHO urged all states, territories or countries with low-risk populations to cooperate to combat the virus. It said: "There are very high numbers of mosquitoes and they like to suck up the air like wet fish."

Scientists now fear an outbreak of Zika virus in the US could follow up with more outbreaks, which could also happen.

In recent days, several US cities showed signs of a significant decline in cases, including San Francisco, New York and Boston.

Health officials said earlier this week that some 18,000 people had not been tested for Zika virus.

More health experts were seen at the US Consulate on Friday in Miami where they also received calls, along with a number of people who were sickened earlier this week.

The Zika virus is also transmitted to humans through contact and birth.

The virus can be spread to humans only if the body contains the virus, although it can also spread through small particles rather than by bites from infected partners.

Officials with the World Health Organisation said earlier this week they were still awaiting "proclamations" from Brazil, where Zika has been detected in some parts of the country.
