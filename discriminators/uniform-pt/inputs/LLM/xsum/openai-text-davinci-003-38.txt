A spokeswoman for NHS England said that the woman was "being treated at a specialist NHS centre and is in a stable condition".

The patient has not been named but St George's Hospital in south London said that she had a "recent travel history to a country affected by Ebola".

There are currently no cases of Ebola in the UK and the risk to the public remains low. The hospital said in a statement: "Our hospital is following all recommended guidelines to ensure the safety of all patients, visitors and staff and to minimise the spread of any infectious diseases. The patient is being treated with the utmost care, according to standard protocols, and we have robust infection control measures in place."

The hospital also said that it was taking all necessary precautions to protect other patients and staff. It added: "We are in contact with our local Department of Health, are working closely with Public Health England and have access to additional specialist medical advice should it be required."

The UK government has also said that it is "well-prepared" to deal with any cases of Ebola in the UK and has put in place "significant steps" to protect the public from the virus.
