The takeover will give Severn Trent control of the company, which provides water and wastewater services to over 200,000 customers in the north west of England. Severn Trent has said that they plan to invest Â£150m over the next three years to improve their services and make them more reliable.

The takeover also includes a commitment from Severn Trent to maintain jobs at Wrexham, where the company's main office is located, and to keep the company's local management team in place. The company will also extend its apprenticeship and training programmes for employees and offer additional employee benefits.

The takeover of Wrexham Water will expand Severn Trent's operations and make them one of the biggest water companies in the UK. It will also give them access to a new area of customers and create more opportunities for growth.
