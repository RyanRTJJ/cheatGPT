The last place

The Boks had been trailing until the 33rd minute but then took the game within their reach.

They created their chance with a breakaway try in the 26th minute and when they ran out the tourists were awarded a penalty try.

But their defence denied them several opportunities.

By 33 minutes they were down 17-0 up.

In the 38th minute Matt Toomua's conversion gave Canada the lead.

They put the Boks' tails up to regain their composure before the break.

But a penalty try from Rolfe Nel triggered a spectacular try coming from a long ball.

The ball, which was recovered by the Boks, went over the line before Toomua scored and France were forced to score a try of their own.

At the break Australia had two tries and were only a point ahead, but the result was always going to take a couple of days to settle.

The Boks got one back in the 40th minute through the boot of Luke Romano, but after toying with the Canadian defence for long spells Canada took control again.

And at half-time, Australia had dropped to 14th position, only one position ahead of the Scots.

It wasn't enough for the Boks as they won 14 of the next 16 points in the game, and were unlucky to miss out on a chance to join France in the play-offs by one game.

But the loss leaves Australia seventh, six points behind Argentina.

It means that the Springboks will have to play four top-flight teams in their next three games as they bid to stay in the tournament, starting against Australia in Edinburgh next week.

It means that at the very least, they will not be able to finish fifth next week but that they will have a run in the play-off.

For the Australian fans that were
