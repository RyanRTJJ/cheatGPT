 saying that it did not believe Tokyo knew enough about trade between the two countries.

Japan's ambassador to London, Hiroaki Nakanishi, said in 2014 that he was in regular contact with Clark's department. In a sign of the high degree of awareness that Britain felt about the current situation, a senior Japanese business expert was in the country last week for talks with government officials.

A senior Japanese government official told the Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Japan Times) that there was not a single Japanese official in Australia to attend last week's AIMS meeting, meaning that no country officials were involved in the summit itself or the discussions that preceded it. According to the Japanese government, Australia's influence on the negotiations was negligible.

Japanese officials said they thought Australia had no intention of making a trade deal with Japan if the country failed to meet the two-hour target of a 10-percent tariff cut for all goods coming out of Australia and an equal 20-percent tariff cut for any goods coming into Australia.

After the meeting, Japanese industry executives have begun to talk about the possibility of a formal deal, potentially at the next AIMS meeting that begins on March 19.

Japan's industry minister, Jun Azuma, said that the government could sign a deal as early as Sunday.

Japan's foreign ministry said the meetings and discussions in Australia last Monday would "form the basis for the future negotiations between the two countries." It's understood that the two countries are in talks over a bilateral trade agreement, which could include a free-trade pact.

Australia's foreign ministry has made clear that no further agreements are in the pipeline at this point.



In the lead up to the AIMS meeting, the Japanese government has taken steps that appear likely to stymie the UK's trade negotiation efforts.

The two countries have started to negotiate an alternative to the bilateral trade pact, known as Cairns Round, to keep the two countries from signing the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement
