The government confirmed an additional £25m is set to be allocated towards the £1.5bn North Pennines rail improvements programme. The £1.5bn will fund 8.8km of electrification work, including works on the South Pennines and East Coast Main Line.

It will also allow the North East to receive £50m of additional funding for rail improvements, in the form of a Crossrail franchise or other investment.

Scottish politicians expressed disappointment at the news, calling for more investment beyond the initial 10-year programme.

Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: "North Pennines enhancements will help us make sure that the North East is a world class rail location, attracting jobs, businesses and investment which is good for residents, schools and local businesses."

Last week the UK Government committed an additional £24m towards the North Pennines electrification works.

The project will see railway passenger services linked from Reading eastwards through Lincolnshire and Teesside, via Manchester and Sheffield.

A spokeswoman for the National Railway Museum said: "We are pleased that the funding has been confirmed for electrifying and modernising the North Pennines and will do all that we can to help deliver this for the benefit of passengers and local communities."

A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice said: "The government is committed to making North Pennines a world-class rail location and the £50m will help to kick-start the work now needed. As well as supporting the Northern Powerhouse and a prosperous Northern economy, it will also support Northern train users.

"Northern Passengers Association have been asking this Government to fund electrification of the North Pennines since 2008 but with each passing week rail passenger numbers continue to decline. We have just been given £25m in funding that will allow us to improve the rail journeys people will take when they come to work, shopping, and visit family and friends.

"We have also increased our focus on the East Coast Main Line, with an additional £50 million of investment committed. This will help Northern commuters avoid gridlock on journeys between London and Birmingham and Leeds Bradford Airport.

"There is still work to do on the proposed new railway line in North Yorkshire
