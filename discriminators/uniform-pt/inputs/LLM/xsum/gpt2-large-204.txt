 great feeling, a dream come true," he said. "It was an exciting moment when I touched down at Loftus Road - I'm so grateful to be back in the side. "It means a lot to have been given my first start for my club and I hope to repay the fans with goals and assists. "I just wanted to take my game to another level this season - and now we've got some good results and good matches under our belt we need to maintain the momentum going into Christmas Eve. "It's an amazing feeling being a Liverpool player now. I've come here to take this club's club at the top and now I want to do it under Jurgen Klopp's guidance, under the guidance of our manager. That's the aim - to play in the Champions League [in 2017]. That's the main goal for me. We're just going to enjoy Christmas with the team, celebrate and enjoy each day. "There are some very good matches coming up after the international break - we know that we have quite the run-in ahead of us."

The Reds boss is hopeful the talented teenager will join him in a move to Anfield later this month.

"It's very good, even before the game he made me a present, a big box of chocolates from McDonald's. I was very pleased with that.

"He had his doubts. I can help him a lot. I'm talking about just talking for him, giving him advice - just talking about the game, I'm talking about the game!"

With Christian Benteke's contract ending this summer, Klopp has identified the striker as a player he believes can form the basis of a new partnership with Philippe Coutinho.
