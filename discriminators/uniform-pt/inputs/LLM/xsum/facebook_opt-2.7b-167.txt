 remains in custody assisting police with their inquiries into the incident.

Passengers on the bus were transferred to another vehicle while emergency services attended, and those remaining on the bus were offered food and water.

The bus, which had been on its way to Durham City University, came to a standstill on High Street, near the former Halifax store, and officers cordoned off several lanes of the road.

A male passenger told The Chronicle: “A lady was lying on the ground. We were at the other end of the bus and heard a bang.

There was blood and women were crying.

“It happened quickly. We went straight towards the window.

“Some women were crying, there was blood and women were crying.”

Another passenger said that one of the elderly people on the bus, who had been standing with the driver, suffered a cardiac arrest. The bus driver tried to administer CPR.

“Apparently the people standing with the driver were helping him CPR but there was some blood on the floor. I think it may have been the person who hit the lady,” she said.

Durham Constabulary said the road would remain closed until approximately 7.53am, but appealed for anyone who saw the incident or the black Suzuki Alto to come forward.

A spokesman said: “I can confirm that a 65-year-old woman has died after a vehicle and pedestrian crash in Darlington, early this morning. The driver of the vehicle remains in custody assisting police with their inquiries into the fatal incident.

“The road remains closed until officers are satisfied that the traffic investigation is complete as we try to establish exactly what happened to the woman.

“Anyone with information is asked to contact us at Durham Constabulary on 101 referencing incident 29 of April 12.”

A Halifax spokesperson said they would not be commenting on this on behalf of the bus operator. They also said that an inquiry has been launched into the incident.

Anyone with any information should call police on 0191 538 0123 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, anonymously, on 101
