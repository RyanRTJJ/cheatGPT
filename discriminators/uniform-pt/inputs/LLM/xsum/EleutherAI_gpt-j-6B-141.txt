 will offer a course using resources, including a course material kit, developed by edX.
It says in a press release that the new UT program would launch with two courses: Introduction to Philosophy of Science - which will run continuously for one week - and Introduction to Logic in Natural Language - which will be delivered online. These will be offered as part of edX’s “massive open online courses”.
The program will feature several courses from UT-Austin and from the University of California, Berkeley.

Harvard University (HU) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have launched a project to create massive open online courses - or MOOCs. The University of Texas System is the first outside the United States to join. EdX is currently hosting courses from over 500 universities across North America and Europe.
Harvard and MIT will use the course resources developed by ‘edX to produce new, one-week courses.’ The university system said the courses will be free to students.
The move to introduce MOOCs in the United States was first proposed last year in a report by the President’s commission on higher education. Although a number of universities have attempted to develop MOOC technology, this is the first time a project of this nature has been offered to the public.
‘We are very, very encouraged by what we’ve seen and we’re excited to expand our reach outside our border and into the English language. This is an exciting and important step that will enhance our educational experience and our student’s experience,’ said Dr Michael Shulman, Dean of UT-Austin’s College of Natural Sciences, in an interview with Wired.‘It’s pretty exciting stuff,’ said Robert Birgeneau, head of MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, in an interview with Venture Beat.
Harvard University has already set up a pilot MOOC called ‘Introduction to Philosophy of Science, ‘which is scheduled to run from November 11 to 16.
‘Our first course will be an introductory course that focuses on the basics of scientific explanation. This course will be free to students and available to the entire world without time-consuming travel. We�
