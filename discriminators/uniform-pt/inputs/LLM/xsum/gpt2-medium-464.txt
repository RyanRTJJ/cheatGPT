 the Indian Ocean, for further details of the investigation.

She said the ICC would not launch an inquiry on the complaint until a review of the case was complete and the victim agreed to participate in the proceedings. Her lawyers argued that Ms Bensouda was not acting within the mandate of the prosecutor's office in the Comoros Islands, which was established under the colonial regime of French colonial rule from 1647.

Ms Bensouda said: "The Commission has repeatedly stressed that any decision to conduct an independent investigation in relation to a complaint within the limits of its mandate is strictly the responsibility of the office concerned itself."

She added: "The Commission has therefore received reports that the complainant has agreed to participate in the investigation into the abuse of her human rights and has agreed to submit to the Commission information upon which such an investigation will be based."

An ICC spokesman said it was still considering whether to open an immediate investigation to determine whether Ms Bensouda had established a sufficient level of national criminal responsibility. That would make her responsible for the prosecution as well as the investigation, the spokesman said. Mr Cameron, the prime minister, had promised in August to support the resolution by declaring that Mr Assange's legal aid would be provided if any of the allegations were upheld.

A spokesman for Labour said that, since he was not yet PM, Mr Cameron would be making a decision later rather than in the immediate future.

The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.
