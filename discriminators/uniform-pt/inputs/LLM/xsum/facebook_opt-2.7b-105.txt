The flight, from London via Paris and Gibraltar, was an unusual journey: a trip from England to Australia via France and Gibraltar.

Before the flight, Mrs Johnson said: "I want to test my theory, which is that I can do it all by myself."

The story went on to write the record was set in July 1930 when she soloed from London to Melbourne.

The flight was part of the Women's Air Service to demonstrate the ability of women pilots.

Mrs Johnson's family announced their plans to commemorate her death in a statement: "We are very pleased to announce that following an amazing four-decade, multi-nation, and multi-national investigation, a replica of the aircraft has been created.

“The plans for the new aircraft, which was launched today in a ceremony at the Smithsonian museum in Washington, will include a museum exhibition in London.”

Mrs Johnson's husband Charles, who took part in the commemorative flight, said: "It really is very exciting.

"It has been a long four years on this road with historians, insurance companies, regulators and airlines around the world."

The first woman to fly around the world solo was Dame Laura Brown, who completed the journey in 1938.

Ms Brown died in 1977, but her son Simon continues to fight for the role of women in the airline industry.

At one point, Mr Brown asked Air New Zealand to send a female pilot to visit the museum of the Women's Air Force Museum in Long Beach, California, because he thought the "history of aviation is female".

Despite Mr Brown's efforts, the airline did not have a female pilot working at the time.

Since taking the reigns at Air New Zealand last year, chief executive Christopher Luxon has appointed at least four female pilots to its crew, but more still need to be placed across the organisation.
