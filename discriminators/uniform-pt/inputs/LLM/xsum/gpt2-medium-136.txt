 and a little higher than the 5.2% it reached in July 2012. And that is still at an all-time low.

The May-July jobs report is not the only important measure we have right now. The Consumer and Business Spending data, where we estimate actual spending in the next fortnight, gives us some indication of just what it is spending today. In an economic report today Fed Chair Janet Yellen did an interview with the Washington Post. It is in one paragraph that we learn that the Consumer spending data is much weaker, suggesting that the real economy is doing somewhat better.

We still have another two months of data that tells us something about economic growth here in the US. The jobs report is just the first of many that we will gather. But for now we can all go ahead and get on board the economy and its continued recovery. But if there is a recession, the recovery is more likely to come about when the real recovery is more robust and a healthy private sector.

I guess you are talking about the growth of the gross domestic product that is now sitting there. I am still going into the weekend. No growth at all at all.
