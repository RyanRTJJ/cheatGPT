-resident had complained about "mistreatment and intimidation by staff". This followed three complaints made to the Department for Work and Pensions. The Ministry of Justice also launched an investigation. The former resident claimed the treatment at Kendall House amounted to the crime of indecent assault, while the Ministry of Justice's review found complaints of bullying and discrimination were not the same. The government later settled a civil case brought by a man claiming Â£15,000 compensation after he was attacked by a woman at the church.

The Daily Mail reported on 24 May 2012 that a former Catholic priest, Stephen Nangle, and an ex-minister of a church-run organisation for ex-abandoned children was jailed for 12 years and four months after admitting child abuse over more than 40 years. Other abuse victims took their claims to police with a view to a criminal investigation. In the early 1980s, while living in the country, Nangle, aged 35, sexually abused two young boys, ages four and six. A judge said the former priest had been "crueler to the young victims" than the previous allegations made against him. A number of other men also lived with Nangle. Judge Peter Mearu had told the jury that they had to consider "whether this was a case of a number of evil acts over a period of 25 years or the number of evil acts over a period of ten years."

On 26 May 2012 a court in Essex ordered the family home of the Church of England's Kendall House School in Gravesend to be sold to repay thousands of pounds owed by the charity, the Church of England. It is feared that this may lead to the home being closed or sold. The school received "mixed" reports in one report, which said: "If it means selling, which is what I think will happen with this, I worry that the new owners will not be able to repair it. It is a very serious concern that the children are not in school as it will have an detrimental effect on them - physically,"
