education consortia, which co-ordinate education in Wales.

Ms Williams will also announce a new online hub of information, resources and guidance that will enable all those involved in education to access and share best practice.

The Education Reform (Wales) Bill, which was introduced to the Welsh Assembly in October, includes a range of measures aimed at improving educational standards in Wales.

It includes new funding for schools and an "academic excellence" programme to attract the brightest and best teachers and school leaders too. It also includes provision for tougher literacy and numeracy targets for all pupils and for those who are not able to reach them to have additional support. The Bill also includes changes to school inspection and accountability.

The network for excellence will work through the four regional education consortia, who will be responsible for co-ordinating the delivery of the Bill's education reforms and for disseminating best practice and resources for all those involved in the Welsh education system.

Ms Williams said: "This new network provides us with the opportunity to make sure that all those involved in the delivery of education in Wales have access to the best practice, resources and guidance they need to make sure our children get the best possible start in life.

"This new platform will also give schools, colleges, universities and the four regional education consortia a way to work together and share resources to ensure that everyone in the Welsh education system benefits from our reforms."

The network for excellence will be available online and will be accessible to all teachers, school leaders, pupils and parents. It will include guidance on assessments, teaching and learning, inspection, accountability and the Welsh curriculum.
