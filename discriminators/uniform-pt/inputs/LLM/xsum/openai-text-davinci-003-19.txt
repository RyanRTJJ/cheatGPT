Describing his wife's battle against illness, he added: "The fight Rebecca put up for us over the past four months has been remarkable and her bravery, courage and strength has inspired me.

No one could have done or gone through what she did and every single minute of it she fought until the very end. She has been gone far too soon and no day will pass or place I go without thinking of her."

He also thanked everyone for their support, writing: "The messages of support and love through social media, emails, letters and cards has had a huge impact on me and my family. The hashtag #prayforbecky will remain forever, as that's what all our family and friends did, and Becky was always aware of all the goodwill and love."
