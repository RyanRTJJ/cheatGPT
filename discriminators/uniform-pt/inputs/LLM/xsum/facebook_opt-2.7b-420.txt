 the children from the poorest parts of Britain often struggle to get into places at elite universities. There was no change for boys despite the rise in higher education in recent years. The study, The State of Opportunity, is published in the Journal of Child Development.

The analysis found that the proportion of the brightest children who attend university has fallen from 43 per cent in 1998 to 30 per cent in 2012. The analysis, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, found that the proportion of pupils in the poorest fifth of the UK population, in relation to income, who attend university - on average - has risen from 3 per cent to 14 per cent.

It found that the highest gap in educational achievement was between pupils from the most deprived fifth of the poorest families and children in the most affluent fifth of the most affluent families. Nearly 6 per cent of the brightest poorest children who do go to university do so at the most selective universities, such as Oxford or Cambridge. In comparison, about 10 per cent of brightest richer children go to such universities.

The authors said they were worried that the trend may be exacerbated by a failure to expand opportunities to all pupils with potential at school. The study found the largest declines in entry to higher education occurred for boys, with the proportion of bright pupils who go without a degree of more than 50 per cent in the East Midlands of England, London, the West Midlands of England and South Wales. Those from the poorest 20 per cent of families are most likely to have not attended university, although these results varied by age.

The authors cautioned that the results of the study could be affected by the availability of places in each university and that it was not possible to determine the impact of educational and social policy changes, such as reducing school exclusions by the young.

The authors said they were critical of social care policies which had "undermined the efforts to ensure early and sustained intervention into schools of disadvantaged children". The researchers suggested that education and social care needs to work together and
