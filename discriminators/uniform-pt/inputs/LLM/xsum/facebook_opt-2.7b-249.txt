 is still keen to appoint a new ambassador to Brazil, and added that Israel can do so if it wishes.

Niv Avrahami declined comment on whether the appointment would be accepted after Brazil's elections this month. However, he said: “We are in regular contact with the Brazilian foreign ministry and have made efforts to make clear that Argentina-Brazil relations will be fully maintained.”

According to reports, Dayan is to be appointed ambassador to Brazil. He is said to have informed some in Brazil of his arrival on Friday. Days after Dayan's appointment, a new Israeli-Argentina agreement to allow Argentine citizenship was signed in Buenos Aires. Dayan's predecessor as Argentine envoy to Israel, Liron Rozon, took over similar duties in Brazil under Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva without being appointed by the government.

Dani Dayan was born in Argentina just as Argentina was beginning a military dictatorship. He grew up near Beersheba, where his father is a well-known lawyer who has represented many Jewish and Israeli clients. He received a Jewish education and studied law and economics at the University of Buenos Aires.

Dayan was married to a Brazilian woman who had two children with him before divorcing.

He then moved to Israel where he met his wife, with whom he has a daughter, in 2001. They returned to Argentina in 2008 where he was a senior economist at a local bank for two years.

Dati Daya has published several books on family and religion. His father is a member of the Brazilian Communist Party.

“During the dictatorship [before Argentina ended democracy in 1976], members of the Jewish Diaspora were prohibited even speaking with Jews in Argentina,” he said when he spoke at a conference in New York in 2009, “only in special cases they were allowed.” He was born a refugee in Israel.

Israeli diplomats who represent Brazil had also been banned from leaving the country after the military coup of General Alfredo Stroessner's government in 1971.
