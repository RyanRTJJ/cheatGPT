The car company confirmed the crash on its official account social media account, which said it had "lost communication with the Ferrari driver who suffered minor injuries in an accident".

"The matter has now been referred to Swiss authorities to investigate the incident," it added.

Ecclestone has previously announced that he wanted to replace Senna with Niki Lauda on the 2005 F1 season.

The sport remains the world's most lucrative, with annual income of Â£9.3bn in 2013, according to Forbes.

Ferrari said on Saturday that it had suspended the driver from driving until the investigation was concluded.

The British Formula 1 team also issued a statement about the accident, saying the decision had been taken in the "interest of the driver and the team".

Senna, who was driven around by his helmet in the accident, "appeared to be shaken but otherwise uninjured".

His accident drew international attention in his home country as well as the United States and Brazil.

US-based broadcaster NBC has also reported that an F1 circuit has a safety record of 98% with a zero fault rate.

Earlier pictures taken at the scene by the BBC's Richard Conway showed a group of men in t-shirts with the name of their insurance company, and Senna's number plate.

The accident happened in the town of Coda in Switzerland on Sunday.

The official Swiss motorway company, Interlagos-Coda, said the accident had occurred at about 1:00pm (3:00 GMT) and Senna had been involved in a "heavy braking" incident.

"The driver was travelling in the right-hand lane of P2 but made a turn in front of the car driven by the driver who then lost control," the Swiss state-owned company said.

"The accident occurred after he changed lanes in front of his own car which was on the right."
