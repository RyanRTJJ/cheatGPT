 in any way blocking fuel supplies.

It seems Nepalis are right to be frustrated: Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, has cancelled a bilateral summit meeting scheduled for 26 June to discuss a variety of issues. While it cannot be called a full-scale border blockade, New Delhi has cut off almost all of the goods trade between the two countries which stands at 60 million USD.

The dispute over Nepal's new constitution, which allows for federalism and greater influence for the people over the federal government structure, is the main reason behind the ban, say the Indian media.

New Delhi has warned that Nepal's new constitution, which was brought in less than one year ago, could end its 50-year-old alliance.

"We are a union of union territories and states with a unified constitution. But the new constitution being implemented in Nepal is different," said a statement sent by Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson, Syed Akbaruddin to the Indian media.

Despite the Indian External Affairs Ministry's statement that this is purely a fuel blockade, Nepal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has described it as an "economic blockade." This, added the Ministry, has also "impeded people-to-people exchanges, including cultural ties."

India has asked Nepal to reconsider the constitution and has called for dialogue.

"India's position is clear. We do not oppose decentralisation but do not accept it. The proposed constitution, if you look at it logically, it provides for a situation where the federal government is empowered. The federal government is empowered so that it can make decisions on behalf of the people. We don't know why Nepal wants a federal government. Why would you want that?" said Akbaruddin.

Nepal is the third-leading source of foreign investment to India, which is eager to see trade with neighbouring countries grow over the years. India has invested around 10 billion USD in Nepal so far.

As a result of the border blockades, fuel supplies to Nepal have been cut off, and prices are expected to increase further.

"There will be further increase in fuel prices across the country as there are no supplies to refill the vehicles," said Yubaraj Bhattarai,
