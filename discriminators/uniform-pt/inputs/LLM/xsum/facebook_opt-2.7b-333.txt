 any funding or clinical support can be given.

"This is a temporary measure until our doctors, nurses and other health staff can be redeployed to care for patients."

It is likely that this would include helping to care for patients in their own homes, as well as at hospital wards.

It is hoped the new initiative could see additional GPs and nurse-led teams.

It will begin with four sites in the first phase, with plans in place to extend to up to 20 by the end of March.

Chief inspector of general practices Dr Clare Gerada said: "We are grateful to the Department of Health for the extra funding over the next four months and look forward to receiving the necessary patient referrals to assess the support needed."

The four new sites will be in North West Lincolnshire, Cheshire East, Luton South and Bristol.

More sites may be added "as the situation evolves" or, in the wake of the closure over winter of the hospital sites in North Devon and the Midlands, the department said.

The new approach comes as NHS England and the Department of Health attempt a new agreement for GP services. However, no dates have been set.

Meanwhile, a group of health organisations have written a letter to GPs calling on them to reject "underhanded" funding proposals for GPs.

The letter aims to challenge a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) rule on "cost savings".

The letter, sent to GPs in England, states that if GPs opt into the cost savings rule, patients may be forced into private health insurance and therefore pay more for their own health cover.

The group of 14 charities, GPs and think tanks, warns that a "small group of consultants and some middle management" in the health system are looking for cost savings, which threatens people's access to care.

In a joint letter, the group warns that while the cost-cutting targets they have agreed must be realistic, many are not affordable.

It says GPs should resist pressure to sign up to the new rule, which they say only serves to reduce access
