Sextortion is the term we’re all too familiar with. It is the idea that someone uses images of your intimate moments to coerce others for their personal gain. The person with intimate knowledge gains monetary remuneration, while you get to suffer.

The internet is full of those images, some of which are stolen through other means. Others have been downloaded by the victim. Scammers may have downloaded them, then blackmailed users to send them nude photos by threatening to release them.

The rise in sextortion cases has been met with a rise in awareness, and with technology, the number of reported cases is expected to rise too.

So what, how, and when did sextortion start?

Before the term sextortion was coined, people blackmailing others on the internet used more crude and direct means. The blackmail usually began when someone would make unwanted advances towards someone online – and not everyone was aware they were being targeted.
