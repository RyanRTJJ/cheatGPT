 tests were approved by the Iranian authorities and the Iranian military, he added.

The test was conducted under the supervision of two of the leading experts on Iranian missiles: Iran's vice president Ali Akbar Salehi and Iranian defence ministry spokesman Brigadier General Hossein Salami, he said.

He said that "a new generation of missiles with advanced technology", including missiles with range greater than 8km, were being produced but they were not yet ready for use and more tests might have to be done. "Therefore we must be prepared for any future developments in their development to better safeguard our national security," Mullin told RT.

On the issue of Iranian nuclear programme, Mullin asserted that Iran already had "sufficient nuclear fuel" but "it is not the purpose" to enrich. "When the time comes for further enrichment… it will be done," he added.

Mullin said that some sanctions had affected the Iranian economy, raising international concerns about the international isolation of Iran. "It is now going to enter uncharted waters," he said. "Our aim is to achieve progress in global arms control, and the most important point to accomplish it is international military-to-military cooperation – and I think that was one of the areas of agreement."

"We do not expect to have any breakthrough with anyone in this area… Our aim is to stop enrichment and bring Iran back to the path we have been on for the past decade," he also stated, emphasizing that "any nation with Iran's nuclear potential should not be deprived of its right to self-defence," particularly since Tehran was the largest shareholder in two of Iraq's military installations the US-operated Quds Force in Baghdad and Quds Airbase in Asclepius in Iran's south-west. The US should "reassure Iran that they don't have nothing to worry about", the head of the Foreign Office stated.
