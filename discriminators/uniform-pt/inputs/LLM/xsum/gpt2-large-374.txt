 Ryan Hoffman, who scored the only try, said: "He looked so confident, with that swagger about him and the way he played the game. To just turn up and score like that was amazing." There was a mixed reaction from the home crowd when they saw the full match footage. Some of those who watched it at home had no idea of what the All Blacks had up their sleeves but there were some who knew. "I don't know what to do," said a man who watched the game. "I watched it live, I didn't see the full stuff but I was expecting so much more."

The Warriors took time to enjoy their win, with players and coaches working hard to recover from the mental and emotional challenge. In the end they were happy to get some revenge against their last-place rivals, who ended their World Cup-winning streak by winning by 43 points in Edinburgh last weekend against the Scottish Cup side. "It's a gut wrenching feeling to lose to these guys," said Taipan captain Mervyn Smith. The Warriors got on the board inside an hour and were already looking on course for a second straight double and their first home victory in 23 Tests.


"They came out really strong in each and every phase of the game," said coach Steve Hansen. "They looked like the team to beat. They had a bit of a let down at the end of the day, but they're still a tough squad to play against and we'll just have to get on with it once they get past that." The Warriors began the week under a cloud after they were fined Â£80,000 by the International Rugby Board after a number of officials were suspended with concerns about the conduct of referees and assistants in last Saturday's defeat to France in Monte Carlo.

The penalty comes nearly three years after a similar episode saw the board reprimand the England men's rugby side for a second straight weekend.
