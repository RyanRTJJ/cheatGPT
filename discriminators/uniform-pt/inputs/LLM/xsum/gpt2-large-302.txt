14 on tourism, compared with a total of Â£34.6m spent by Visit Wales.

A spokesperson said: "Since our beginning in 1996, Visit Wales has been working hard to develop our vision for a vibrant, friendly and growing visitor experience for business, tourist and business travellers."

In its annual survey of Welsh business leaders, Visit Wales was described as the national destination of choice in North Wales, its sister city Cardiff and the Isle of Sheppey.

In the national survey, the Welsh economy was rated as the "best" in the UK, with a tourism performance of 7.9 out of 10, compared to 8.1 for the United Kingdom.

The survey also identified seven other Welsh cities that were the best "tourist destination", ranked ahead of London, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Edinburgh Airport.

The survey came out as Visit Wales unveiled new figures from Visit Britain, the UK tourism body that is trying to turn up the heat on British tourism from an austerity era.

Tourism Wales chief executive Richard Hurdsey told The Register the UK's tourism sector is "in crisis", warning that "the biggest challenge will be persuading the rest of the EU to take an interest in this sector".

He noted that Visit Ireland, Ireland's tourism industry organisation, is expecting a big drop in tourism to the country because of the new EU spending caps.

"It is time for the rest of the EU to take an interest in the English speaking and Welsh part of Europe, otherwise Wales will not have a future as an attractive travel destination," he said.

"We have already seen the impact of cuts to EU funding for tourism with fewer events going into the EU's summer tourism calendar, and fewer visiting UK holidaymakers."


He added the UK's new spending caps were also "disruptive" to Welsh tourism, because they would also "drive up the cost of travel" and create "differences in the cost of accommodation".

The number of flights leaving from major cities around the UK will see an average price jump of 12.4%, with Manchester, Leeds and Exeter predicted to see price rises of 17.4% on average and London expected to see a 16.7% increase
