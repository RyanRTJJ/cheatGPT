 of the fish did not meet safety standards for food for human consumption. The fish were brought into Hong Kong from the Chinese province of Fujian, where they were caught by fishermen. The CFS and local fishermen had planned to auction them at their annual Seafood Festival on Wednesday night, but organisers postponed the event for the time being, after officials learned of the embargo.

As early as October 21, Chinese fish producers warned they were planning to export fresh Pacific bluefin tuna, an endangered species, to Europe as far as the Mediterranean coast, citing "serious ecological and financial risk" stemming from the country's declining fishing industry.

In a recent documentary produced for state broadcaster China Central Television, the world's number one tuna importer China Fisheries Export, a Shanghai-based company, said it was not being able to import the species due to "growing safety concerns".

Although the world's tuna stocks are "unimpacted by these risks, the sustainability of the industry remains affected by these risks," the documentary said. The documentary, titled China's Fish and Ocean Resources, was released on Wednesday.

In May, Fisheries Minister Gao Zhisheng warned that international tuna fishing could end next year if global tuna production fell below 5,500 tonnes per year.

The Hong Kong tuna is not a typical bluefin tuna, but the Asian Bluefin Taskforce (ABTF) describes it as "the most endangered subspecies of bluefin tuna worldwide".

The tuna are so-called because they weigh 30 grams less than the common bluefin tuna. They can grow to more than 4.5 metres in length.

Tuna consumption is one of the main contributors to global ocean plastic pollution, according to a report published by the ABTF, which has been leading the campaign for a global ban on plastic waste in the 20th Century.

The ABTF said fishing was also putting "at risk the survival of some of the world's most critically endangered marine species".

"Tuna have become increasingly important to the global marine ecosystem, contributing to a variety of marine ecosystem services, such as pollution control, fish meal and food security, in addition to contributing to local food security."

The ABTF was launched in December 2012 and
