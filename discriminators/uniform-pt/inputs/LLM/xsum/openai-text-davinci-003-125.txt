 hand to witness the Blues beating Pep Guardiola's Premier League champions 2-1 with goals from Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud either side of Raheem Sterling's opener for City.

Arsenal and Chelsea, the only London clubs in the FA Cup semi-finals, will come together for their clash at Wembley Stadium. It will be a repeat of the 2017 final, which Arsenal won 2-1.

The Blues sealed their passage to the showpiece occasion thanks to a stunning performance at Wembley, sparked by Barkley's header after just six minutes and which was sealed off by Giroud's curled finish. The two sides now face a London derby to decide the 2020-21 showpiece, with the #RoadToWembley ending in a city near home. 

Arsenal, who reached their 21st FA Cup final, advanced after dispatching Championship side Sheffield United 2-1 on Sunday. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice to put them into the final, with David McGoldrick's late strike proving to be nothing more than a consolation. 

Arsenal are looking to win the competition for the 14th time, while Chelsea are targeting their ninth title. Whoever wins will take home the world's oldest football trophy and a place in this season's Europa League. The runner-ups will earn a place in the continent's second tier tournament, the Europa Conference League.
