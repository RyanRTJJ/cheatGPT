Scotland have shown they can compete in this year's Six Nations with an heroic victory over Ireland.

Having won the opening game of the tournament against Italy before coming up short against England, Scotland produced a stunning performance to put Ireland to the sword.

Andy Robinson's side were never behind in the game, with Mike Blair and Chris Cusiter pulling the strings as Scotland ran in some superb tries.

And with winger Joe Ansbro scoring his first Test try, Scotland showed they can be a force to be reckoned with in next year's tournament.

It was a performance that earned them deserved praise from both the media and their fans.

Captain Rory Lawson summed it up by saying: "We showed that on our day we can beat any team, whether it be at home or away from home."

Full-back Stuart Hogg, who scored two tries in the win, echoed that sentiment and said Scotland are confident they can beat any opponent in next year's competition.

He said: "We showed in this tournament that we can stick with any team and we've proved that during the previous summer tour.

"If we can put those performances in during next year's Six Nations tournament then we have a good chance of doing something special and getting our rugby back in the place it was before."

It was certainly a performance that Scotland can build on in 2013, and if they maintain the same momentum then they could be dark horses for the Six Nations crown.
