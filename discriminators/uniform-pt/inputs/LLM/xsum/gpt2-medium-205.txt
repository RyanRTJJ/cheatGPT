 police permission to conduct searches in the wake of widespread criticism of their tactics.

Detectives said the operations involved police using air bags to search cars for missing suspects. They confirmed that another 11,000 officers had been deployed to the area of Woodcote Street, Woodcote Square, Stirling Avenue and Colleycove Street, all on Saturday.

Three car keys were also recovered, possibly taken from under the wheel of an older vehicle. Police were also searching cars on Islington Road in Eglinton and a number of nearby properties. Two vehicles were searched near Clonmel Road and police are hunting for another group of individuals.
