 fine for exceeding the maximum two-car parking limit. Photograph: Andrew Medichini/AP

A lawyer who took his child on a holiday to Florida has successfully challenged an £800 fine.

Jonathan Platt, a senior partner at a large law firm in London, took his nine-year-old daughter and his wife on a trip to Disney World in April 2015.

Platt, who is based in Jersey, said he had received a notice from Isle of Wight council warning that he had been “found in breach” of the local authority’s maximum two-car parking limit.

Platt told the Guardian the fine was “ridiculous because it is clear that you need three parking spaces for two cars and we had been to a theme park within that space”.

Platt said he had received the notice just hours before he was due to fly to the US to attend a conference for his firm. But Platt said he had already paid the fine because he had been worried he might miss the flight to Florida and not be able to fly back after the conference.

Platt’s experience is believed to be the first case of its kind in the UK. “This incident has really raised awareness,” said Caroline Behan, chief executive of the consumer group Which?.

Behan pointed out that there is no UK law which prevents local authorities from fining motorists for exceeding the maximum parking limits in their areas.

Platt said he had contacted the Isle of Wight council’s head of parking. “I was told that they would appeal against the fine,” he said. Once the appeal had been rejected, his council was due to refund the money within a week or so, which was a fair deal, said Platt. A spokesman for the Isle of Wight council said it did not comment on individual cases.

The parking rules of Isle of Wight state that the maximum number of car parking spaces should be two for any type of vehicle. It also says vehicles could be parked without permission if they were parked near businesses which required permit parking between 7 and 11.30am
