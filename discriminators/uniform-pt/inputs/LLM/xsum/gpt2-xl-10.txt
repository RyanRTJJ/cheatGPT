 underway by summer 2017.

With transport issues affecting people across the country and the north, particularly in Edinburgh, it has now come to light that the Welsh Government have awarded the contract to the same consortium.

Transport for Scotland is responsible for the planning in Wales, and it has always been the intention of the department to work closely with Jacobs. Jacobs have operated in this country for nearly eight years, working as consultants under multiple administrations, including in the last administration (the Conservatives) from 2011-2015, and between 2010 and 2013, under the Liberal Democrats.

Under the terms of the contract, the Welsh Government will be responsible for the procurement process and overall administration across Wales. Jacobs will also take a £1.4m pay-out from Transport for Scotland in a further effort to improve their financial position.

Transport for Scotland will also provide Wales with a £1.9m cash grant. We are committed to improving mobility in Wales, and we want to ensure we're delivering projects with a real impact on the people we serve. We have already delivered over 200 miles of Cycle Superhighways that provide direct links between major cities, including Cardiff, Newport, Swansea City, and Liverpool.

At a time when the financial position of the Welsh Government has become less robust than usual, and as part of our commitment to help tackle the deficit in Wales, the Welsh Government have agreed to support Transport for Scotland in its spending decisions so that it has the ability to get projects of significance through the procurement process and to deliver a better deal for motorists.

This is an exciting new phase for Transport for Scotland, one in which the government has become increasingly active in delivering solutions to road congestion, promoting the use of sustainable mobility, and working with the public sector.

The Welsh Government have been highly supportive of Transport Scotland across all four measures, and they fully anticipate the strong partnership that they will establish.

We look forward to working with Transport Scotland on delivering meaningful improvements to the mobility of north Wales and beyond.
