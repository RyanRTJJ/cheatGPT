-row forward Luke Robinson also faces up to two years if successful on his appeal.

Jones has been a regular in the Lions squad and has taken 20 tries for Wasps this season. His presence saw a major improvement in the Wasps' form when Jones was released in November after spending more than 12 months at the club.

The 25-year-old Jones has spent the remainder of the season on loan at Nottingham.

The Lions will not announce the signing until a day before the start of next season, when a club website is likely to be updated.

Cricket correspondent Simon Wilkins wrote to the BBC last week about several English coaches being linked with coaching jobs and he has now been told that John Lloyd, whose coaching career has spanned more than 30 years has been linked with a move to the RFU.

Lloyd joined the RFU in 1981 and served as a player, assistant coach and head coach before he became the first coach in the post-War era in 1989.

“Lloyd is a great ambassador for our sport and a brilliant friend,” said RFU Chief Executive Tombe. “Everyone in sport, from rugby-players to coaches, knows that rugby is inextricably linked to its fans around the world - it is for them, and for them alone, that we will always champion our game.

“John has had a great career and we are pleased to have him join the RFU. We are looking forward to welcoming him into the club’s family.”

Ex-Wasps wing Luke Robinson has told BBC Radio 5 live's sportsday programme that he will apply to the British and Irish Lions while serving his ban from international rugby.

Robinson, who helped England cause a surprise upset at the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand last month, was handed a two-year ban after being convicted of possessing marijuana.

While Robinson was banned by the RFU, his club was awarded a ban for the two domestic club games played against Bristol at Ashton
