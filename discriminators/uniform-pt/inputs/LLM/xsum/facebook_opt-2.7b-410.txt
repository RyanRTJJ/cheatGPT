In 2012, the Operacion Puerto cycling scandal prompted the International Cycling Union (UCI) to implement a series of anti-doping measures.

"It's a very important step and is the result of all the hard work which the Anti-Doping Laboratory (ADL) and the Spanish cycling federations have been doing in recent years," Spanish cycling federation president Emilio Arz√∫ said on Wednesday.

"The Anti-Doping Laboratory was not able to prevent doping but made it impossible to take advantage of in-competition tests," explained the Spanish anti-doping chief, who was responsible for the Operation Puerto raids.

The revelations of Fuentes' clinic helped pave the way to another landmark case 10 years later, when Operacion Puerto helped uncover another widespread doping ring.

A Spanish anti-doping official warned riders would be investigated for suspicious patterns of blood-testing after the Operacion Puerto drugs investigation in 2011.

The warnings, which led to a number of positive tests, helped to expose a network of doping operators in several sports including football.

In February this year, former Real Madrid football star Raul Gonzalez tested positive at a pre-World Cycling Team championships event in Denmark. He denied any doping and told his former club of his innocence in August. The investigation is ongoing.

The Spanish cyclist's positive test was the latest example as to why the Operacion Puerto revelations of 10 years earlier still rank as the biggest doping scandal in cycling history.

The fallout was so severe that the UCI banned Fuentes from cycling in 2002 and the Spanish government even issued an international arrest warrant for his arrest in Spain -- an order the UCI and Spanish authorities then dismissed.

After the Operacion Puerto incident two years earlier, Fuentes was banned for life from competitions, but the Spanish government refused to extradite him. The UCI has also refused to extradite Fuentes to Spain as Fuentes fought
