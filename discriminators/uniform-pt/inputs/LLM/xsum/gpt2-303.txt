, but the software will now be available at all broadcasters across the world.

At the same time, as the broadcaster moves to remove all language in the future, its own digital assistant programme, Lulu, will be free to anyone, from just about anyone. The program will now be watched by people using the app's app store instead of by their local broadcaster.

"Online viewing is a new opportunity to introduce and share unique viewpoints," said Mr de Vries. "We know the value that broadcasters have in the digital world and we are excited about how audiences expect to see the programmes and the commentary that has been brought to their attention so far.

"The new Lulu service will give us the tools to offer viewers the choice of where their comments would be aired by using Lulu Plus within the network."

He added: "This is an important step in bringing the value of our voices to a wider audience and it is a good first step towards the creation of a digital media environment that will lead to a more vibrant and connected online experience.

"Lulu Plus users in the UK and Ireland will not only be able to browse the Lulu catalogue on their local channels, they will also be able to see an alternative broadcast.

"This is a major breakthrough from a technology standpoint and one that the Lulu Plus programme is only beginning to see impact on the world.

"More and more people will use our digital service even when they are not using other services â€“ making it both easier and less expensive for those willing to be part of the digital age, as well as more attractive to the casual listener."
