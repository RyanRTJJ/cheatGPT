 government to pay around $20,000 to cover her medical expenses.

The issue was brought to a Supreme Court for its help in the past week, but it refused to give a ruling that would overturn the earlier court decision, which said that women have a constitutional right to die.

After the Supreme Court’s refusal to rule in favor of either side, the state-run health service stopped making payments for the abortion, but the girl still has not had her baby or received a refund of the money, the court heard.

In the absence of a Supreme Court ruling, the state-run health service that has received the government money in this case must continue making payments — but the court, in its ruling, ordered the health service to give priority to children from poor families or who may be married with just one child.

A case involving a 13-year-old girl in Indonesia went to court last week. The case brought to light an issue which has been discussed globally in recent years: Do young women have a constitutional right to die if they are raped or coerced into having an abortion?

The Indonesian girl was a student attending high school in Jakarta, where the country’s president, Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, was also a student. The girl was raped by a classmate, who was 17 and had no family and no means of supporting a child.

She said that the rapist began trying to take her virginity and eventually he took her to a private clinic for an abortion — but the clinic refused her entry, saying she was underage. She became pregnant. She had four sons and is now divorced from her partner. She was forced to give birth, and the rapist, who was jailed for the crime of sexual assault, got out of jail and killed himself.

She, along with her parents, then brought the case against the Indonesian government’s health service, which was funding the abortions. The health service refused to pay and said it had no legal power to make arrangements for an abortion on someone else’s behalf. The judges ruled in favor of the government’s actions.

The Indonesian Health Ministry is now being investigated by the National Commission on Human
