 is known to be spread by humans.

Zika was first found in Brazil and Brazil is home to some of the world's biggest cities, such as Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, as well as major ports such as Luanda, and Rio, where it is spread by swine, which can make its way across the Pacific and South American oceans.

Experts said that Zika could be linked to the development of birth defects related to the virus and other sexually transmitted diseases.

While Brazil and other countries have pledged to limit its Zika virus outbreak to areas where it does not cause birth defects or reproductive problems, the virus remains highly contagious. In some parts of the world, the virus also has been responsible for serious bodily infections.

The virus can be passed from one child to another in about 12 weeks because of the long incubation times of the first person to develop the infection.

"With the onset of Zika, the first time something gets airborne in a child and someone starts to develop Zika-like symptoms, it can start a cycle of symptoms," the International Commission on Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (ICRIRD), a regional body under the UN agency, said in its statement.

The WHO called for the government to undertake a global public health campaign to eliminate all mosquito-borne diseases by 2020, and urged parents to protect their babies and children.

The Zika outbreak affected 4,621 baby lives, and a total of 7,039 infants, young children, and adults died in the first outbreak, the WHO said.

In the same report, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said: "This case suggests that this virus is a new form of birth control, particularly because of the long incubation periods in which babies develop."

The United Nations Development Programme has pledged to phase-up the use of birth control from 2002 to 2014 and expand its participation in efforts to help children and adolescents who have had birth defects after unprotected sex.

Last year, China, Russia, and Vietnam signed a plan to phase-up birth control
