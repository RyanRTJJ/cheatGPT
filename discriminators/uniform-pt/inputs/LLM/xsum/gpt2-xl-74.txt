 the pace.

"It was the first time I've driven a car like this," Hamilton said. "With the downforce it's harder to get the full lift with a turn of speed. They have a good set up because they are quick in the exit and on entry, but they're not super quick on exit. A bit of a brake on the throttle, and suddenly they've got great, fast speed. It was fun."

Both drivers also used their slower Red Bull cars in qualifying, with Vettel qualifying sixth while Hamilton was 17th.

The Australian, who said there was still room for improvement in the car, also said: "This is like the hardest I've driven an F1 car. We've had no laps in the car yet, and we need to learn more.

"The one area where I'm a little disappointed is that there's little room for error if somebody really wants to set up and push hard in qualifying. It would be nice if cars weren't that quick and we could have more opportunity to set up a little bit."
