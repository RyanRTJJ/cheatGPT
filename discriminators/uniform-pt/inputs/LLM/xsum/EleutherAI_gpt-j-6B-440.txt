 1 of June, so you might see that hashtag pop up as you tweet in the run up.

How we’re approaching it

To be clear, Brexit affects the way people at home vote in the EU referendum.

That means that we will be able to deliver a message at the correct time, ensuring that those tweeting in support of the European Union will still get their message right to the people who want to sign up. It’s the same as, say, sending an email, if you know who your audience are (and you do if you’re on Twitter!), and you try and target that right by going out to search for those people. So with Brexit, we’re going to go out to search for those people, and we’re going to be sending them a particular message.

If you’re interested in this, then feel free to get in touch – this is something that we’ve been planning since we’ve been running this campaign, and it’s in addition to our other channels of communication. On the flip side, if people are getting all of our messages on a time, in whatever channel, then it means that our messages will have less relevance than before.

You never know about the European commission’s own hashtags, so that might be something to bear in mind, but it’s not a huge concern for us – the hashtags you’ll need to be aware of are the ones from the UK government.

A different approach from the “Brexit” campaign

The idea is to get tweets that are talking about it, but not coming to a real conclusion. These tweets are often
