 of the FA," he said. "We've got some issues in the way of leadership, but most of it is about managing the clubs. The system and structure has been outmoded the past two years." The FA has since expanded its umbrella from 40 member clubs to more than 40 including Premier League sides and Football League rivals.

The FA chairman, Andy Burnham said: "We must recognise there is no one fixed place in football. We will seek alternatives which will enable us to continue to grow." The new umbrella is still in place but the FA "will no longer be as dependent on three different owners, for the best opportunity for the players to succeed in the Premier League," he added.

But Burnham said it could be better to use his time to expand the organisation, which was expected to reach $100 billion with a global headquarters and the right to make changes to take away any owners who want to run it.

A former England international who retired aged 58 last June, he insisted the FA could not provide "the long term security required by the present system". "We don't have the time to set things up. We can provide all the facts, which we cannot do in a 24 hour period, which is a lot of work."
