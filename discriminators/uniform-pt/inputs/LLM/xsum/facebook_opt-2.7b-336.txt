The number of under-fives dying in African countries has fallen 70% since 1990, UNICEF says.

The data, by country and year, also revealed that the number of under-five deaths has declined in 94% of countries but has stagnated in 24% of countries.

According to the data, the share of under-fives dying was highest in sub-Saharan Africa—40% in 2011—when it was three times higher than average across the globe. Overall the figure was less than half the 1990 level.

"What we are getting is a major global achievement, but no one is saying that it is complete," Anthony Lake, UNICEF executive director, told AFP.

"This achievement does not mean that every child lives in a happy, fulfilled society, where every child can go to school, where every child has a shot at life. That's why we say 'wipe out by 2016.' The 2016 target was very ambitious," added Lake.

UNICEF also said it was concerned about a decline in immunisation rates affecting both children under one year old and over one year of age.

The number of children under one year old contracting polio, measles and rubella (German measles) fell from an estimated two million children in 2009 to zero in 2011.

However, it said, the decline in mortality rates for these diseases was "a fragile achievement" and urged governments to invest more in surveillance and immunisation.
