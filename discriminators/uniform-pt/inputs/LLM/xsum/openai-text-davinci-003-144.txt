 and Clyde's deputy director of nursing, Fiona McQueen, said: "We have identified a gap in our cleaning standards and, although there is no evidence that this has compromised patient safety, we take this matter extremely seriously.

"As a result we have immediately taken steps to ensure that the affected area is cleaned to the highest standards. We are carrying out a thorough investigation to understand the reasons for this incident and to identify any wider issues that need to be addressed. 

We will ensure any learning is shared across the organisation and take appropriate action to address any issues that are found. Patient safety is of paramount importance to us and so we are committed to ensuring that our hospitals are clean and safe environments for care."
