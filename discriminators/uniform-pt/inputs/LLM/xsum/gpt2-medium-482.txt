 developer summit earlier this year. The company said it wanted to make the phone so that its components could be used without the risk of damaging them.

The company will be available on Android 6.0 Marshmallow.

The phone comes with a 3.0-inch (960 x 540 pixels) touchscreen display with Corning Gorilla Glass 4, and it charges via USB rechargeable, one port, and includes WiFi dongle for pairing with the phone. Google introduced some connectivity options for the phone, with dual-band 802.11n Wi-Fi 2.4 and dual-band 3.5GHz Wi-Fi 2.0 providing cellular connectivity.

The camera on the phone does support shooting videos in 1080p at 120 frames per second, if users want to take pictures in 1080p, with 1080p video resolution. Users will need to set up two cameras with 4K recording and take the photo, but that technology hasn't been confirmed by Google. The handset is powered by 1GB of RAM, 3G (with speeds of up to 600Mbps), and will allow users to use it on three major networks: AT&T, T-Mobile USA, and Verizon Wireless.

Google said this is Google's first time building a consumer smartphone, and with its existing Android operating system, the company is able to take advantage of what it has learned and refine that system to improve a lot of things along the way. It also said that the company was able to improve battery life as it had to be careful with the components because the phone needs to be updated every two years.

Android 6.0 Marshmallow launched alongside the Galaxy S6 Edge+ that has already had the Google Nexus phone, and a new generation of the Moto X (4.4-inch, 6.3-megapixel, 3280 mAh), which Google opened with Google I/O.
