 an undefeated 70.

Australia had earlier posted a score of 200 for eight in their fourth innings, having batted for an aggregate of 1,000 runs in their first three ODIs as part of the tour.

They will play in the play-off tournament in Bengaluru today after beating New Zealand just before 5 o'clock, and have two wins from two matches to their name but still cannot match England's overall record, and will require another win in the ODI series to top the rankings. That will be achieved if they beat New Zealand in the two-match T20 Series in the Caribbean.

Ahead of the two international fixtures the Black Caps will have to contend with a high-level selection dispute for the opening three games.

"All four of the Tests have been scheduled to avoid the issue of the World Cup qualifying tournament, which New Zealand did not attend due to the demands of their cricket in the West Indies to secure qualifying for the 2017 World Cup," said NZ Cricket.

"Since the Black Caps played the home series against the West Indies at the WACA stadium, the ICC has given NZ Cricket a letter of assurance and the games will be played as scheduled. NZ Cricket will be given further information in the likelyhood of staging in future to enable better governance."

NZ Cricket also played down the chance of an agreement with Cricket Australia given the recent issues with their touring teams.

"Any concerns about the level of competition as seen by Australian teams are also not relevant to NZ Cricket's position nor are there any plans to take NZ-ALO games away from Test cricket," the NZ Cricket statement said. "The games will be played as scheduled pending this situation."

Meanwhile, South Africa's World Cup squad were named earlier today by the International Cricket Council, with Kagiso Rabada, AB de Villiers and Dean Elgar all named in the 23-man squad that will represent their country at the world cup in June.
