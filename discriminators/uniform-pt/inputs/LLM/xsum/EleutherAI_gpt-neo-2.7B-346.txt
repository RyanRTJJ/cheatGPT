 insists that his side are still confident.

And he says they are still optimistic that they can lift the Liga title at the Santiago Bernabeu next Monday as they look to continue a strong start to the season.

And Neville believes that the squad he's assembled this season is better than the one he had last, with new signings such as James Milner and Jack Rodwell coming into the side as the transfer window opens in Spain.

"If you think about who has been involved, the players we have in our squad are doing very well," he said.

"They're all in their mid-20s, they're all really exciting players, really fit.

"We're looking forward to playing them and to seeing if they can carry on the way they are now.

"[The players] who are under the radar to a certain extent are getting on and the new players coming in will definitely come through the team.

"You would like more consistency from them all. That's the most important thing now - trying to have a good run of games and getting consistent goals.

"I don't think we've got the consistency from anything so far, though. I just think the result doesn't seem to be with us, at least in the league that we're having a go at."

Despite a midweek win over Barcelona, with Gerard Pique hitting the post with an acrobatic header, the result was overshadowed by poor defending from the champions, with a string of goals in the second half.

"The first 40 minutes were fine but the second half against a team that was very solid in terms of defending, I saw that [the visitors] were a better side, very strong," he said.

"At the moment it's our second gear where the chances are being created in the final third, particularly with me playing, and we're able to get those chances.

"We've been in our second gear for a while now and with that being the case we're not getting them, not for me."
