bn, to £2.8 trillion (at the official exchange rate of 4.5%) - a rise of nearly £10,000 a year from £2.7 trillion. These are estimates by excluding the impact of tax changes and includes more generous allowances of pension benefits, although these could be affected by the tax rise.

The deficit has been narrowed from £17.9 trillion in 2008 to £14.8 trillion (excluding the impact of tax changes). Excluding the impact of tax changes, excluding VAT changes, and excluding further increases in pensions and tax credits the deficit is now forecast to fall from £20.8 trillion in 2008 to £15 trillion in 2014 before falling back gradually. This forecast was based on data from the mid- to late-2008 period.

This growth was driven by a gain of 9,300 working in the NHS and 557,200 in education.

The most visible change over 2008 was in the public sector. Public sector employment rose by 30,300 to 6.2 million for the period. This was driven by a gain of 1.7 million public servants working in the civil service and 828,200 in the Department for Work and Pensions. The ONS estimates this result is likely to be close to the real rise in the public sector because the
