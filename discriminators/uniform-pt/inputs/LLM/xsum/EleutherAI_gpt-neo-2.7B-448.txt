But as recently as 2015, Australia said there were "no figures" available to confirm the death toll.

The Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton last month said up to 150 people had died while trying to reach Australia by boat since the start of last year.

The number includes migrants attempting to reach Australia by land, and also those who died during attempts at sea.

'We're in the endgame'

Last night, the Department of Immigration said it was aware of the number on the deaths but refused to confirm it.

Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said he was "concerned" about the increase in deaths, saying: "I'm a little bit taken aback by it."

He said the government was working on a plan to deal with the issue.

"We just want to know how and why it (the deaths) happened and we're in the endgame there for sure,'' Mr Joyce said.

"We're working on this issue and the challenge for our immigration department and government, first and foremost, is to do the right thing and not be a complacent party in this regard.''

One of the deaths was in late 2014, according to the DIA.

A series of new boats, known as rescue vessels, arrived at Australia's northern port in Gladstone in January.

The government said the boats would only be used to rescue migrants who are "in trouble".

In the wake of the deaths, there have been numerous reports of migrants being held at sea, and the boat people have made some high-profile court cases in the last week.
