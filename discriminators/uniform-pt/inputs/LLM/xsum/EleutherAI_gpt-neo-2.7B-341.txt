 jobs, including those to be created in the British Army, and a £2.5bn programme to build two new aircraft carriers. In total, GD plans to generate £5.4bn from the new investment.

Worker recruitment will also triple in the new year as the firm expands its existing UK facility.

GD’s chief executive, David Purvis, said: “We remain very confident about the future of the business and are pleased with the business plans we have been able to develop in 2019.

“This is a significant acquisition for the Group and highlights our confidence in the future of our business – which continues to grow and create value for our shareholders.”

The decision follows a long wait for the final deal with the owners of the factory – Visteon. The company, which makes air-conditioners, had held talks over the acquisition for the past five years. The British company and the US automaker signed the agreement at the beginning of July.

Visteon also had to delay construction of a £6.3bn car factory in Coventry so as to meet deadlines, adding a further six months to an earlier £2.7bn investment. Visteon remains committed to the deal with GD, but it has said the delay could affect its position, and could lead to “unacceptable” prices.

But both Visteon and GD are optimistic about the future of the business, which is continuing to expand, with GD moving to expand its manufacturing and maintenance operations and with it taking on an additional 18,500 workers worldwide.

One of GD’s partners, German car giant Daimler, told reporters the company expected the new factory to begin production in 2024. The manufacturing plan is three years earlier than previously expected, Daimler said, and the work could not begin until mid-2023 or 2024 because of a legal dispute with the company to secure its investment.
