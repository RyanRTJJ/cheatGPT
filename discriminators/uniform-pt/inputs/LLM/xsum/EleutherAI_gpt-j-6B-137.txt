 staff at the airport had removed her passport from an airport bag.

McGarry, an MP who has campaigned for an independent inquiry into alleged killings and abuses by British forces in Iraq, posted the incident on her Twitter site and said she was now "terrified" of her movements.

The security staff, carrying her property, "were rude and not very thorough", her lawyer Sean Gallagher, from the law firm Hetherington Stewart, told The Telegraph, and "took her passport". "They did not actually want to remove it off her but they were told to do so by airport staff."

There had been no warning and no reason given for the intrusion, Gallagher said, adding that it was "not something I have ever experienced in my time in the UK legal profession".

The MP spent several hours in an airport detention cell before being held for nine hours while the airport, which refused to comment on the incident, processed the passport issue, he said.

McGarry said on Twitter: "Today airport security held me, took passport off my bag, & I spent six hours in a detention cell. I'm devastated, shaken & terrified."

She added: "They held me while they checked my whole bag & didn't say why. In spite of their rudeness they were thorough.

They took one bag of mine, I had just come from a court hearing & I took a lot of legal stuff - passport, ID, a copy of my birth certificate etc."

At the airport on Thursday, a security official told her there would be no answers, only questions, she said. "I could see their interest in the fact that I was an MP. That was a bit worrying. It was a very intimidating experience."McGarry, a solicitor, had been on a conference in Luxembourg with several other parliamentarians. She was travelling by car from the airport.

The incident comes at a time when civil liberties supporters are increasingly worried over how public authorities are monitoring travel, and whether MPs or the public are treated unfairly
