Investigators used a fake Facebook profile to lure potential customers to a tattoo parlour, then set up a sting operation. Some clients were brought undercover into parlours, where undercover officers posed as underage customers looking to get their first tattoo.

The investigators found another 10 shops offering discounted prices for tattoos, but many others were not licensed.

Police are now hoping to find parents to conduct undercover stings to catch more illegal shops.

The NSW Police Service said it had received "numerous" complaints from concerned parents in relation to unlicensed
