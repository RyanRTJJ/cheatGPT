Residents have said they fear for their lives. Some have left their homes without shoes.

Kyodo quoted a man telling news agency TV, "We have so much damage and we will be gone. At least we shall be dead".

At least 2,000 people have been reported to have died through lack of food and water.

The number of people forced to take shelter was reported to rise by two thirds due to the flooding over the past few days â€“ the Kyodo reported earlier this month.

Japan has yet to respond to requests for help or any kind of assistance from the United States and Europe.

Officials will decide on whether to hold a summit on Thursday to discuss the crisis or to continue the international effort to find and help survivors.

Kazawa said the government would meet with both Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Foreign Minister John Kerry in Helsinki.

Abe will also meet with UN member-states to determine how to respond to the disaster.

Meanwhile, Japan's foreign minister, Yoshihide Suga, called for an independent and more direct role in the relief efforts.

At a news conference on Tuesday, Suga also addressed the news conference in the Tokyo suburb of Sendai.

The ministry said it was investigating the situation in Japan in connection with possible looting, rape and rape incidents.

Officials have said all of those being searched by police, but there has not been a single call to police from women and children.
