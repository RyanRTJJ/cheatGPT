Ang Ilbo on Aug. 23.

The Note 7 was Samsung’s fourth-best selling phone in its most recent quarter. It was pulled from the market in August for weeks after Samsung was advised to recall the device.

Samsung shares slipped as much as 1.7 percent on Tuesday. In morning trade, South Korea’s benchmark Kospi was down 0.7 percent. The stock had lost 8 percent since the phone was recalled on Sept. 2. The electronics company has lost half its market value since then.

“Samsung may be the weakest of the major smartphone makers right now,” said Nam Tae-hyun, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities in Seoul. “The industry needs the company as it is the leader in the global smartphone market.”

Samsung is set to release its quarterly earnings on Sept. 11. Its competitors led by Apple Inc. will report next week.

Samsung makes two thirds of its profits from mobile phones and TV sets. Profit fell 30 percent last year as spending on costly new factories failed to keep pace with booming demand for smartphones.

The company slashed its sales forecast for this year’s quarter to 1.5 trillion won ($1.26 billion) from 1.7 trillion won, citing weak consumer spending at the end of South Korea’s traditional shopping season.

Samsung warned that its sales could decline for the rest of the year as other electronics firms like Apple and Amazon.com Inc. cut back on spending.

The company is also bracing for Apple’s iPhone X. While several companies have unveiled smart speaker devices like Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, Samsung had not introduced a voice assistant with a screen that would work with the Note 7.

“They had to rush last week to prepare [for it, and] they were scrambling to fix all this,” said Lee Jong-won, an analyst at IBK Financial Investment Co. in Seoul.

The Note 7 was released the same week as Apple released its own voice-controlled speaker, the HomePod.

“People were waiting and trying to understand, because Apple didn’t really introduce anything,” Mr. Lee
