Mr McPherson said: "If our company had gone into administration and we were paying it off it would have been very difficult to do things or change the company's procedures. "This is a clear example of how much people believe in their jobs."

After a similar incident six months ago, The Guardian reported that a company in the UK, where employees were forced to work from 7am to 3am in a public street to ensure employees were paid as much as possible, had warned a company of being forced to cut benefits.

On Wednesday, The Independent published allegations by an internal investigation into the firm's management.

The company, which has 1.3m jobs, is owned by two major clients, the Ailes & Co (AWC) group, and the BSE and FTSE 25 companies list firm Fidelity Investments. The FTSE 25 companies list the firm as an indirect subsidiary of Fidelity, although it is not registered in the UK.

Last year, Iain Duncan Smith apologised for advising the government of a private company he felt was under threat of losing its Â£2bn-worth of assets. There have been claims that this decision, under pressure from a number of government-run businesses, was given by the business secretary, David Blunkett, at Cabinet level.

The company employs 160 people in the UK.

Mr McPherson called for "extraordinary action" against the company over the scandal, saying his staff were in a situation where "the whole situation could have been avoided". He added he had been "councer to the government on the business and financial situation in Scotland for 10 years".

A spokeswoman for Mr McPherson said: "If anything is to be done to improve job security in Scotland it is the right decision for the company.

"The government's decision to increase recruitment costs for this company to cover redundancies after a year of no pay, particularly following the recent scandal, reflects a Government that has made its best efforts to minimise the impact on job security in Scotland."
