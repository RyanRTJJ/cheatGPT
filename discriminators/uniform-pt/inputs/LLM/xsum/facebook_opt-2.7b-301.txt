 visible on the street."
Shelter House staff decided to use the money to buy one-way bus passes for their street outreach workers and to help offset some of the costs associated with the program.
"We know where everyone is at, what their needs, and how to support them whether it's with housing, food, clothing, shelter, or harm reduction," said shelter house co-ordinator Mark Anderson. "The grant allowed us to provide them with safe, clean spaces where they can get out of the cold and be warm, safe, and fed."
The bus passes helped to pay for bus rides to and from shelters and to drop off bus tickets at shelters in surrounding communities.
A team of five community navigators work to help connect clients to services that will support them in staying off the streets. The program offers a safe shelter site, food, clothing, shelter, and support services for individuals experiencing homelessness and at risk of transiting to the street or being trafficked, sexually exploited, or forced.
They are also able to provide clients with resources that can help avoid problems that could result in jail or prison time.
Counselling services, detox facilities, financial support and outreach for resources such as housing, health care, and employment are also available.
"I wish I could give them all a hug. They are amazing and so brave," Anderson said about the people who use the service and the support from donors such as the man who made the large donation.
The Shelter House has only provided services in Thunder Bay for about five years and has now connected with other agencies in other areas of northern Ontario to become a 247 resource, Anderson said.
Shelter House is now looking for donors to help out in 2017. The money raised will go to support their next grant application to the Northern Housing Foundation, Anderson said.
Funding received must be spent or applied for within one year.
If donors contribute to the Shelter House's 2017 fund appeal, they can be assured that their contribution goes for services that will be used immediately and will not be tied up
