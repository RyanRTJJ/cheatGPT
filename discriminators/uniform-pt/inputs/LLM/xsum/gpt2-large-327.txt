 Andrew Witty, 14 months in prison for his role in the scheme.

Witty was reportedly paid over six figures by GSK and other companies involved in the payments over a period of 18 months and has been sentenced to more than 3Â½ years.

The bribes were paid in order to have their products promoted when they were not approved by the FDA. "The bribes paid by GSK to physicians in China and elsewhere led directly to the approval and the use of the products for clinical uses," Judge Robert Sweet wrote in his ruling

Witty was arrested alongside two other GSK executives, Peter Coviello and Steve Wacholder, in July and faces a maximum maximum term of 20 years in prison.

However, Sweet's decision is unlikely to deter medical companies from using bribes to get their products approved, which have been linked to deaths and serious side effects.

"That's exactly what the pharmaceutical industry wishes to happen," said Eric Weissman, senior staff attorney with the Drug Policy Alliance.

"These cases highlight the continuing conflict between the FDA and the industry," she added. In the past, Weissman said, drug regulators have been reluctant "to go after the big pharma companies and their top officials."
