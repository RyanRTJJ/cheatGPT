 could no longer deliver treatment. The news came after a letter from Ofsted, the education inspectorate, said there was "no suggestion of a breach of any rules" regarding the treatment of children at the care home.

A spokesman said: "The trust has asked Ofsted to reconsider the initial decision to withdraw support and will consider their request.

"We have now completed two annual inspection reports for the trust and found the trust's practice has improved significantly over time, and no breaches have been identified to date."

The charity Children in Need said the findings will only reinforce the importance of having a family planning and sexual health service in the UK. They said the care home was "a real case study" of the lack of a safe and appropriate abortion service in the UK.

"It highlights the need to have an independent public service offering services to protect girls from unwanted pregnancy and also to facilitate informed sexual and reproductive health education."

Ruth Hunt, the charity's chief executive, said it was possible, although difficult, for a teenager to make sure they had a birth control method of her choice before she came of age.

"In Britain, there are no abortion services for girls aged 16 and under. The only legal abortion options available are those through specialist clinics. The only health care service for girls aged 16 and under in the UK now is in the Caribbean island of Jamaica – and their service is poorly funded."

Hunt said it is likely to be difficult for the care home to attract staff. "The current care home offers home visits. It is difficult to draw on a single provider in the South East English region and a very short journey to London."

In 2011, the government proposed a bill that gave women in the UK access to "safe and legal" abortion services in England within 18 months of obtaining a legal termination. However – despite a substantial lobbying effort from reproductive rights groups – the bill was defeated
