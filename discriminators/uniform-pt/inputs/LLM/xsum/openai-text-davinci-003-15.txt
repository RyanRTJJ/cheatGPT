vative" way of producing electricity using the power of the river.

The project, which is being developed by a consortium of private companies, is expected to start generating up to 4 megawatts of "green" electricity by 2017. It will involve the construction of a river turbine and a weir, as well as the installation of fish passes, to enable fish to pass up and down the river.

The project team, who are working with Scottish Water and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), are currently in the final stages of the planning process before they can apply for full permission to construct the generators and operate them.

The project is expected to cost around Â£14 million, and the team is planning to create a fund that will benefit the local community. They believe the hydro-electric generators will bring both economic and environmental benefits, as the energy produced will help to reduce Scotland's dependence on fossil fuels.

The hydro-electric generators are not expected to impact on the Gala Water itself - the water flow will remain unaffected as the river continues to flow down to the River Tweed.

The project is not without its critics, however. A local environmental campaign group has argued that any noise and construction work associated with the project could have a detrimental effect on nearby wildlife.

The team behind the project are hoping to allay any fears by conducting a thorough environmental impact assessment prior to the start of the project.
