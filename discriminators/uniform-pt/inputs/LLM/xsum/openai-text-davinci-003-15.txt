But his fate was sealed after a run of one win in nine matches that left the Gorgie club four points adrift at the bottom of the Scottish Premiership.

Cowell's head of recruitment Alex Smith revealed in his own statement that results weren't the reason due to the performance level of the team.

"Craig and I have been discussing the teams' performance since our arrival 15 months ago and although the results weren't what we had aspired to, we both have agreed that we have seen progress and a real improvement in our team and style of play," Smith said.

"Maintaining our Premiership status was always our main aim and we firmly believed that under Craig's leadership, this could have been achieved.

"It was with great regret that we heard of Craig's departure and we wish the club every success in their future endeavours."

Responding to news of his departure, Cowell said in a statement: "I'm absolutely gutted to be leaving Hearts after such a short period of time but I'm very proud of what we achieved here in the past year and a half.

"I want to thank the players for their hard work and dedication and the staff who have been incredibly supportive.

"I wish all the very best to the club and their supporters, I have loved every second of my time here."
