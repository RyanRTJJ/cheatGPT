-year-old still has not reached 100% and is not expected to survive the operation, she alleged.

"If she wants to run she needs to get the help of a doctor," said his mother, Fazio Olimpa. "In those cases doctors give her blood instead of an anaesthetic because it makes it easier."

Hospital staff will soon be making stops to check the young woman's condition and will not have access to her doctor to check for brain damage. But Olimpa's daughter is already running away, with her boyfriend and two other friends staying in the area.

This is not the first time young girls have been affected by the roadside roadblocks they encounter while leaving Athens, but in this case there is no indication that the road will be closed in this case, nor at this time do parents or grandparents know about the roadside roadblocks.

Greek officials have repeatedly denied the allegations against them, claiming the road is unsafe.

Meanwhile, the country is moving gradually to make more efficient use of its scarce resources, particularly as cash flows rise. The government will spend more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to buy new gas for trucks at the new stations, including a new facility in the Greek capital, Athens, that will double efficiency this year and will be used to deliver electricity instead of diesel.

If the road is closed, Athens will use 6 billion euros in new electricity every 10 to 15 months to power its roads by 2020. Such a plan, which will also help pave the way for more trains and buses, will eventually cover 100% of road traffic in the city.

And a more serious problem, according to one of the girls' friends, is that there is a growing awareness that roadside closures are potentially causing more tragedies in rural areas and the wider European Union.

But the family is already getting desperate calls from family in Germany to come to Athens for support.

"We are desperate," said
