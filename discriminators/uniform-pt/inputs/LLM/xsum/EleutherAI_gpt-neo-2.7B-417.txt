 trial on corruption charges since Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled in 1989 and sent to Leopold Bonvoisin's infamous Securitate prison.

"The court is convinced that (Ponta) is being investigated for his personal role in two cases: in the case of the Carpathian steel plant in Transdniestria in 2012, and in the case of the Romanian engineering conglomerate Aurelius-Kiril and its subsidiary Arzant. These two cases are in particular the most important and they demand special respect in a country like Romania," reads the court's decision read.

Ponta has repeatedly denied involvement in both cases, calling them politically motivated and blaming the Romanian media for overstating them.

In November, Ponta's chief of staff, Dorin Cocoş, was sentenced to four years in jail for "cooperating in a criminal association for the purpose of abuse of authority" on corruption charges connected with the Aurelius-Kiril case.

He denied any involvement in it in July: "I have no hand in this matter. I have not been informed about this matter," he said at the time.

The sentence was upheld by two different appeals courts on Monday: one for the first time for "cooperation in a criminal association" for corruption, and another for the second time for the same crime.

Ponta's attorney, Radu Vîlceanu, on Monday said he is not surprised by the sentence, because he is going to appeal the sentence to the Romanian Supreme Court, which did not rule on the charges.

A former director of Aurelius, Alin Ciprian Dascăl, was convicted of fraud and money-laundering for his alleged involvement in the Aurelius-Kiril's money laundering case. The conviction was handed down by an appeals court, and the Romanian Supreme Court refused to reopen the case on Tuesday.
