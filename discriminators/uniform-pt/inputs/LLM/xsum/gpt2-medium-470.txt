 Ms Walsh's "violent behaviour".

After being banned from campus she has been involved in street protests. In May she walked out at the annual anti-racism protest by chanting "there are no Asians here".

Ms Walsh said: "At the same time I did this for a living, I felt unsafe living in a white community - I felt I'd been made to feel ashamed of my ethnicity."

She said she didn't want the incident to take place.

"At first I said I wouldn't take offense and that I had no idea what's going on," she said. "I also didn't want to be judged on the day. I wasn't trying to scare anybody.

"No. I was trying to take a stand for myself, trying to raise that issue of racism on Scotland's campuses."

A Glasgow-based businesswoman, who couldn't be named for legal reasons, told The Independent: "We're appalled that Ms Walsh has breached this principle. What she's done is despicable."

"This was not a school, but instead an adult club and I am appalled that somebody who should be celebrating the coming of winter as such, could so blatantly disregard any decency that has been put in place.

"In any case, it is our opinion that people who are on an ethnic basis should have a certain level of respect and dignity and that can be breached without offending anyone.

"On the Scottish Independence debate I'm sure she's made very good use of her platform for that cause and she may be on her way to becoming a celebrity within the wider community in the wake of her incident."

A Glasgow-based student of Ms Walsh said: "It's very clear that the main purpose of this demonstration was to make someone feel uncomfortable."

Some of the supporters who have flocked to support her have started a rally in opposition to what they claim has created a "racist" environment.

Maegan O'Brien from Strathclyde University Students' Union claims Ms Walsh's actions breached the Equality Act, which she claims places unfair obstacles in "the path of individual students trying to come forward as a minority in their own right" and further stigmatises people from a particular skin colour.
