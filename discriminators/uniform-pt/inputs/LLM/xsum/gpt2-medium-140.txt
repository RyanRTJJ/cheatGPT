's aunt, who is also a former Police Scotland officer, says she was told: "What you're reporting is completely false."

The mother-of-four, who lives in Dundee, says "no comment" and says she doesn't care what Ms Bell does with her computer, phone or laptop. "As long as she gets the full story out, I'd accept nothing," said Ms Bell to The Herald. "I wouldn't have said anything to her if she was talking about a police officer – it can't be right,"

She says: "He was in a grey blazer and white cotton trousers and was in the back seat doing nothing." The man, who was known to Ms Bell by his girlfriend in Edinburgh during his time with the Scotland Yard, came into Ms Bell's home around 11.30am and she later found out he was her boyfriend, the mother said.

Ms Bell, aged 42, from Aberdeen, Scotland, says the incident took place two weeks ago. "After I've seen my mother in the house about 10 or 11 times, some random girl said hello to me. And she said 'Oh my God', and he was smiling at me.

"She turned to me, 'Is this one of yours?' and I was just just absolutely stunned. He had a long blonde t-shirt on, brown shoes, brown top and black suit with dark grey cuffs – it looked like he was working out in Scotland in style – and his girlfriend was in her late 20s. She turned and saw me with him and it was just an eye-opener.

"She said 'Oh my God. There he is. What happened with his daughter?' and I told her I'd never seen a guy in his 30s, 35 –
