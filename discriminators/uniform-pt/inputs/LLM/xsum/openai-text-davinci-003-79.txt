The cycling community were deeply saddened by the tragic death of Robin Chard at the Oxfordshire Classic Sportive.

Robin had been a keen cyclist and decided to take part in Sunday's event for a challenge. Sadly, after about 25 miles he suffered a cardiac arrest and died soon afterwards in hospital.

His family, friends, and fellow cyclists are devastated by the loss of such an energetic and enthusiastic person.

We would like to offer our heartfelt condolences to Robin's family, friends and everyone who knew him during this difficult time.
