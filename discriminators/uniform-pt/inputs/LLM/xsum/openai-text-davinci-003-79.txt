 taken five-wicket hauls in five of his last six Test matches and is confident of making an immediate impact in the four-day game.

He said: “I am looking forward to my first spell at Hampshire.

“I have heard many great things about the Ageas Bowl and its’ people, so I am excited to make my debut for the county.

“I hope I will be able to contribute some success to the team and make a good impression on my fans.”

Yasir is the latest in a long line of Pakistan greats to play county cricket, including the likes of Imran Khan, Saeed Anwar, Abdul Qadir, Mushtaq Mohammad and Wasim Akram.

And Hampshire director of cricket Giles White believes he can help raise the profile of the club.

He said: “Bringing a proven world-class spinner to the club is a real statement of intent.

“Yasir is highly-esteemed and respected by everyone in world cricket and his tenacity, control and overs span will no-doubt prove invaluable.

“The international draw can therefore surely help to lift the profile of our club and I am sure he will be warmly welcomed in the local area.”

Yasir made his international debut in 2011 and has gone on to claim over 200 wickets in all formats of the game.

He was also named the ICC’s T20I Bowler of the Year in 2013 and is currently ranked fourth in the ICC ODI bowlers rankings.
