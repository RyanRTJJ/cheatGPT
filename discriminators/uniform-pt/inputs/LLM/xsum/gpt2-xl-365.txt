Despite being a member of the Conservative Party since he was elected in 2008, Key is viewed by most New Zealanders as an independent-minded and progressive leader who values equality above all else.

"I am a New Zealander and I believe in New Zealand," he said in a statement on Monday. "The only parties that I've ever been a member of are the New Zealand Labour Party and the Green Party, and there's no reason why my Government cannot be one of those."

The new law will come into effect on December 15, New Labour said in a statement.

"The Labour Party has an absolute policy on the equal treatment of all parties - the Labour Party will respect and work for same-sex couples."
