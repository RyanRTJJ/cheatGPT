 plan would be put into operation and the company's website does not list a current date for construction.

The FAA said airlines must submit plans within one year to "eliminate or reduce to a reasonable extent the safety-sensitive components of a proposed project".

Boeing said the project would "provide a robust design basis for a new aircraft structure, as we do annually with all of our products and services". In a statement, it said it received the FAA permit because it would not "create new flight rules or certification restrictions, and would not introduce new design risks".

Boeing is also working on an engine to replace the CFM56 engine made by CFM International. On Tuesday, the FAA said the engine must be certified to meet the same safety standards as the current CFM56.

The FAA's approval follows years of lobbying by the American-Italian firm, whose technology has been used on dozens of passenger jets and military aircraft but not Boeing's C-17 transport aircraft.

"While we are very disappointed with this decision, this is the result of two very different approaches by the FAA," said John B. Rogers, CFM's chairman.

"The Feds initially insisted that the engine have the same performance as its competitor on the civilian market, the CFM56... but Boeing refused to agree to that, and the Feds finally had to say what would happen if the engine has some performance advantage," said Rogers, the former US Air Force deputy chief of staff.

"That gives us an agreement about how the engine will be tested," he added.

Boeing and Italy's Finmeccanica said Monday that they were close to finalising a letter of intent with an option to build the next generation of military aircraft in the north of the country, near the border with Switzerland.

The two sides have been negotiating since October over the terms of the deal, expected to be worth up to $5 billion, that they say would increase the Italian aerospace exporter's presence and provide jobs as aircraft
