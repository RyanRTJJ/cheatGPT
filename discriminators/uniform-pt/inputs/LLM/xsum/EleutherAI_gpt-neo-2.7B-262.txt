At the 2017 Billboard Music Awards on Sunday, Billboard revealed the Top Social Artist of the Year, with Halsey winning the honor, beating out Cardi B from The Carters, Alessia Cara from The Chainsmokers, Cardi B and 2 Chainz. As for Halsey, she's also earned multiple GRAMMY nominations for her debut album.

Halsey's success has made her an attractive target for cyberstalkers, who sometimes use her videos, photographs and quotes from her to go after their enemies. In February she was suspended from her role at Amazon for a year after an employee told her he didn't like her being so active on social media.
