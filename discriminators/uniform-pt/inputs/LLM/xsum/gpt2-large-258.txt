 teams in 2016, after the International Cricket Council expanded it to 19 in 1994.

Two-way tournaments will not begin until the Australian and South African groups are finalised. "We expect all of the participating teams to be given the go-ahead by the governing body," said Sanzaar, when asked if any changes were anticipated when the tour team is finalised.

Australia had already sent 13 players to Fiji for the 2019 World Cup, including Mitchell Starc, who is set to make his Test debut against Sri Lanka in Brisbane on January 2. Starc made his first-class debut for NSW in 2011-12 and has played three consecutive Tests at No. 7 for NSW State, where he was born and which is the oldest suburb in Sydney. Starc's name is on the books of Waratahs. He is not eligible for Super Rugby but is likely to be called up by the Australian selectors to contest the World Cup in 2019. While Starc is not likely to be sent to South Africa next season, he could be named to the Australian squad to defend its Six Nations title against England at Twickenham on February 6, 2019 if he remains on tour.

"Mitchell is a long way from New Zealand at this stage in his career," a former Australia coach said of Starc. Starc's inclusion on the back of the team will "give his management, his agents, a massive platform to raise as many offers as possible during the next few months so they can get his best and brightest playing for Australia with the biggest possible impact on his stock." In addition, Starc will be in the squad despite his lack of Test experience.

The former West Indies captain played eight Tests as captain and was part of the squad that won a Rugby Championship in 2011 in Cardiff and then won the World Cup.

Sanzaar confirmed it was not a priority to call-up any of the players to play for Australia for the World Cup in 2019, when it has won back-to-back Ashes series.
