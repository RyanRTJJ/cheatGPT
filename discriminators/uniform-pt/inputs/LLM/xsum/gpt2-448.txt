A statement from the Italian foreign ministry said the figures showed migrants already "had been waiting in the jails or detention centres for over 4 months".

Almunia said the numbers "underline the need for action under EU rule." "We have to start looking at some of these people before they go [into Italy] or their family members will go to the police and that's why we are taking action."

The UN Refugee Agency said in May that 10,500 African migrants have drowned in the Mediterranean in their attempts to cross the Mediterranean Sea. Some 895 died in Europe last year, and the number has climbed to 10,450 in 2016, UNHCR said.

The UN was set to issue its new report at the end of the month, which
