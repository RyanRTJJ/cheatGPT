4 million in 2015 – a figure that was almost triple the 972,906 registrations in 2014.

Since its launch in 1998, the registration service has seen three successive years of steady growth, rising 26 percent in 2016 and 36 percent in 2017.

The figures show UK registrations reaching their highest number since the service began, at 2.56 million – a leap of 10 percent on last year. Most of the increase has been in the categories of professional, trade and commercial services, where registrations increased by 14 percent, 17 percent and 20 percent, respectively.

It isn't even the first year in which registrations have grown strongly – but that number was set a decade ago. The number of new registrations grew by 10 percent in 2000, while registrations rose by a further 12 percent the following years.

Britain had just five trade union (TUC) unions last year, compared to seven today. But since the service launched in January 1998, this number has risen to 27. It had 17 trade unions in 2008 but has just nine in 2014 and no union at all in 2017. But if you take into account registration in registered charity groups, the figures can be even more stark.

In October, registration for the TUC's 'National Union of Students' (UKTU) was 943,000, with the UKTU a new rank. Just over 600,000 registered as members, up by 4.7 percent, as TUC membership had reached one million members.

The UKTU has gone far from being a national interest, however. UKTU membership increased ten folds from just under 10 million in 1983 to almost 17 million in 2004, and then was down fourfold since 2010. However, UKTU membership has remained at around 250,000. The membership of the European Labour Congress (EMC) has fallen by one-fifth in recent years.

More generally, membership of the UKTU and other unions is at the point of no return: the membership of the
