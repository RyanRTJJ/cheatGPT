The former Wigan pair have been in contention for games since October but now they are the focus of the match fitness issues.

Preston boss Simon Grayson has called for a change and has named the same starting line-up that played in the win over West Bromwich Albion in early December.

Preston have won just one of their past 12 fixtures against the other four clubs they play in League 2, but this game is their only one in the division since last season.

The Blackpool duo suffered thigh injuries during the 3-2 loss at the KC Stadium last weekend, and neither have played this season.

Preston have six league games in hand on the sides with a home game against Cardiff City and one against Huddersfield at the beginning of a busy run of eight games for both sides.

Blackpool, who won their first three league games of the season to extend their unbeaten run in all competitions to 26 games, had a bye to begin their league campaign but did not visit the KC Stadium.

Preston have struggled with injury problems this season, picking up four injuries to their defence since the start of September.

It was revealed last week that goalkeeper David Button had picked up medial ligament damage in his ankle, but could hope to return to action within five weeks.

Defender Lewis Olsson was injured shortly before this weekend's match against Blackpool and has not been fit for over a month.

Midfielder Matt Grimes has also missed most of the campaign, while striker Chris Maguire has returned to the fitness levels achieved towards the end of November.

Midfield Chris Martin was also absent due to illness and only played under new manager Karl Robinson during the 2-1 win at Wakefield.

The only other change at Head Coach was the signing of ex-Wigan man Ben Marshall from Derby County for Â£2m.

Marshall returns on a free transfer after four-years at the DW Stadium.
