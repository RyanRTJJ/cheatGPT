 35 points from 34 games this season, two more than Los Blancos, who sit in fifth place with 30. This weekend's clash, at Camp Nou, is their best chance since late February.

"We know this is a derby and that the supporters are going to be behind us," added Lilla, but added his "full focus" was on trying to beat Malaga. "What we've seen over the last two weeks is that we are trying to build an extra level of intensity.

"We know we want to win and we want the games to be difficult. And we also know that we have to give anything possible to achieve that goal. We've had chances before and we can't take them."

The defeat leaves Barcelona only two points ahead of Real Madrid, who travel to Alaves this weekend on the back of last weekend's 1-0 win over Deportivo La Coruna. A defeat for Malaga has the Barca staff desperate for a positive result in this fixture. Manager Gerardo Martino has said he would be pleased to get back in the Champions League and is considering returning to Europe to take charge of the Liga side, who have been relegated for 11th time since 1972.

"We will try to win," Martino added. "This is a good chance for us to win against Malaga. We've had many chances in the past and the fans are getting more and more energetic, so I think we should get the three points."

Atletico Madrid, who are also hoping to reach the Champions League quarter-finals, continue as the fifth team in La Liga, with only Sporting Gijon, Valencia, Betis and Malaga having more. The draw has been postponed and will happen on Monday.

Atletico Madrid (4-1-2): Vicente Guaita - Gabi (C), Miranda, Juanfran, Miranda, Raul Garcia.

Real Madrid (4-1-2-2): Khedira, Benzema (Sergio Ramos, Arda Turan), Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale (Karim Benzema, Joaqu√≠n Tuculet).
