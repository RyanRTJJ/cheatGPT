,000 of its customers.

The analysis also showed that at least one-third of energy companies' customers were "out of pocket".

One of the problems had been a failure to tackle billing errors. The analysis showed that between 2003 and 2004, the proportion of customers who were hit by bills that overcharged them rose from 23% to nearly half (46%) - putting energy consumers in one of the most vulnerable groups in the country.

The report recommended that an independent regulator should be set up to deal with complaints about the energy supply sector, to investigate firms who do not improve customer service.

Another of its recommendations included changes to how companies sell electricity and gas.

For example, the report called for "fair and transparent" price cap on standard variable tariffs (SVT) that would be "sufficient to keep prices down".

Ofgem is currently working on proposals for consumer-friendly plans. Last year, about a third of electricity suppliers were ordered to reduce variable tariffs after Ofgem found that they were typically above the so-called limit price cap.

The report said energy ministers had made "significant improvements" to competition in the market but it needed to be more "pro-active" in dealing with complaints.

The report's deputy editor, Kate Barker, said: "Energy companies are going to have to up their game. It's up to them to sort their behaviour out with customers if they want to be taken seriously by Government."

Energy minister Mark Hoban rejected the conclusions of the report, saying:"Ofgem's price control proposal is designed to take the politics out of price caps, and does not propose to limit the market in any way.

"What we want to do is have an open and competitive market, where you can choose from a wide range of providers on the basis of your needs."

'Exaggerated'

Angus Hodge, from the consumer group Which?, called the report "worrying" and said it showed there was a huge need for the government to get involved in regulating the market even further.

He said: "It is absolutely astonishing that, after six years of the biggest energy price hikes, customers continue to be let down by their energy
