 of returning to action he was still in touch with the player but his future remained uncertain.

"I'd say it's up to him; he has to play," said Carlisle head coach Carl Ikeme. "He's just playing, doing his job, whatever he wants to do. He's a good professional and would do anything for his team.

"Rio Ferdinand had to leave us because he was getting too used to the playing position."


It's believed that Fulham's interest is related to the possibility of a three-match ban to be handed out if the 30-year-old is found guilty of assaulting the referee and the player's former team-mate, Adebayor.

Swansea's summer signing Fernando Llorente has scored six times in his first three League games and his fellow Nigerian, Togamisel (knee) and Lassana Diarra are both back out of the line-up with injury after leaving the Swans against Queens Park Rangers on Saturday night.

Aborah said he looked forward to returning to training but a return could only take us so far: "It seems like nothing can be done. I'm not sure what's next, this could be it but, if not… it's impossible. So, if nothing really happens in July, it's only two months until I've to be ready. I really want to return but I'm stuck at work – I'm tired of all the preparation."

Carlisle manager Ikeme: "It'd be a pity if he had to leave today. It is only 20 minutes of the week, which is not the time for a player to go to training, and it's difficult to explain what's going on within, not to mention, to the players. It has never been an easy job for a player like Alberto, but he's a good professional and is committed to the club, so everything's in the right and will change in time for us."
