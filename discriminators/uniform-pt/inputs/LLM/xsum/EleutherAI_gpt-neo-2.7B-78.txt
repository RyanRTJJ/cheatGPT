Former IRA prisoner, Gerry Adams, said it was'sad' to know his sister had died in the 'dark ages'

In the wake of her death, Adams has said he was 'heartbroken' after learning her secret would not be revealed for 90 years.

The IRA has denied responsibility, but has now admitted it gave Ms McConville's remains to the Catholic Community of Ireland in the 1990s after she died.

The community then placed her remains in a glass coffin and in 1994 received it to become a permanent monument in St Anne's church in Belfast.

Sinn Féin has previously said the bodies of all eight of the Northern Ireland hunger strikers, who were shot dead in 1981, were taken to the church and interned, while being kept under wraps in caskets for more than twenty years.

Now the IRA has admitted to providing Ms McConville's body to the community in 1995 after she killed herself, something which Sinn Féin will argue is 'an act of war'.

Adams said there was a 'lot of sadness' to learn his sister is the only one of the twelve IRA hunger strikers that had yet to be buried.

He added: 'Sinn Féin have always said that from the ashes of the IRA comes renewal and a renewed sense of political purpose. But there are still unresolved issues on both sides of the border - what is the best way of doing this, a political solution or just peace?

Ms McConville's mother, mother-in-law and three sisters all agreed to
