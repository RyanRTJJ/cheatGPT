 recommendation on the daily amount of physical activity. About 27% of women and about 19% of men meet the recommended threshold of 150 minutes a week. This is slightly higher than in other comparable countries, however, the differences are much larger than those that exist within particular countries or in geographical areas. This fact, along with the high percentage of people who do not meet the recommended daily physical activity recommendation, creates a problem of public health significance not adequately faced and discussed (WHO, Global Observatory on physical activity, 2014).

In the last 20 years, several large-scale studies have attempted to ascertain whether there are any adverse health effects linked to excess sedentary lifestyle and physical inactivity. On the contrary, several studies have linked physical activity to reduced risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes and obesity. As a result, there are now more and more recommendations such as increasing physical activity to increase weight loss, better health and the general well being of society through the reduction of risks such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes, and certain types of cancer. This, despite the substantial physical inactivity present in most of the world, and even in much of Europe, especially the UK, has become a subject of significant concern in the last 20 years.

Physical activity is defined in one of two ways: physical activity or physical fitness. Physical fitness refers to the degree to which a person is able to perform certain activities in a healthy way for his or her current performance level (1). This fitness level may be associated with a healthier body weight and a lower cardiovascular risk (2). It has been proposed that physical fitness not only contributes to a healthy life style in general, but also to a healthier cardiovascular status in adulthood (3). This means that greater physical fitness during young adulthood and before
