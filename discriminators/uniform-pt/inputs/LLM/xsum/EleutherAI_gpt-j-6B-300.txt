 of juice, and is used to create more stable frozen dessert products like milk shakes and ice creams.

In this article, Dr. Srinath Narayanan at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, together with other researchers from the University of Minnesota, University of Alabama at Birmingham and University of Maine, talks about the creation of these slippery bottles and its relevance for a number of applications.

“We used a coating process to incorporate hydrophobic nanoparticles, which are small carbon-based nanoparticles, in bottle plastic. They are highly stable, highly conductive and can be made to carry a significant current,” explains Dr. Narayanan. “Hydrophobic means that water droplet does not sit on the surface of the substrate. Therefore, they do not attract water. So, when you apply the bottle to water, they don’t get wet.”

Since such nanoparticles can also be made to carry a significant current, the researchers have developed the potential to use them as electrical wires. “One of the ways that we could put this together is that you have a material that can be made into a conductive film or layer for a bottle. So, it could be a layer that carries the voltage or current for the bottle,” adds Dr. Narayanan. “What we did was we coated one side of the bottle using this hydrophobic process. Then, we covered the coat with another hydrophilic solution.”

The coated bottle acts as a very slippery coat. With the coated bottle placed upside down in water, it becomes slippery. Thus, it becomes easier to squeeze out the liquid, even under low pressure, from the bottle. When the bottle is placed upright to the water surface, it takes less time for the water to rise along the grooves of the coating, reducing the resistance. This results in more flow of water from the bottle.

The water from the bottle can be used to wash fruits and vegetables. “It can be done by
