" now belongs to Theresa May, and it is her government that must deliver on her vision.

The first thing she can do is fire her ministers responsible for the government's botched handling of the transition period, which is over on March 29.

To get the best Brexit for the rest of the UK, we must leave the EU without any kind of deal. That means no agreement on a transitional deal, because if the UK leaves the customs union without doing so, there will be no free trade agreement (although the UK may be able to agree to a trade deal in parts).

We know exactly what will happen if we crash out of the customs union. UK cars could suddenly be more expensive, with a 40 per cent tariff, which, even without tariffs on services, would be a huge hit to the UK economy, and to our ability to maintain a competitive edge in global markets.

We would also end up paying more for all kind of other imports, which would hit our business exports. So, from a trading perspective, even leaving the customs union is not good for the UK in the long term.

That's why businesses are calling for a Canada-style free trade agreement (FTA), which would remove tariffs and quotas and keep us out of customs checks.

But the Conservatives and their ideological allies – Brexit Party Leader Nigel Farage and US White House adviser Steve Bannon, for example – want no part of a deal like this.

What they want is an extreme type of Brexit, with no deal with the EU – and the kind of Brexit the Government has been promising for years. They are putting at risk free trade, jobs, and all of the economic gains that have come from Britain's membership of the single market and customs union since the 1992 referendum.

Even the World Bank has warned that it would cost billions of pounds to negotiate this kind of Brexit – and our future prosperity as a global trading nation would be in jeopardy.

The Government has repeatedly promised to leave
