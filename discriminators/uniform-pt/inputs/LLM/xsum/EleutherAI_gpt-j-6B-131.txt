, seen in the CCTV footage above, was caused by the ignition of an electrical spark between two overhead wiring cables.

On the left you can see the scene of the plant's explosion and fire, in the right picture you can see the smoke rising after the explosion.

A third body has been found in the wreckage and firefighters say there is every chance there will be more, meaning the death toll from the incident may rise. Rescue services are now starting to withdraw and search the plant for the missing man who has yet to be found.

One of the three men that was recovered has now been declared deceased.

Emergency services had been sent to the plant at 2.30pm on Saturday in response to reports of an electrical fault and a gas leakage. The flames were spotted by drivers and staff shortly after they arrived and by 7.30pm four hours after the initial spark, the two-storey plant was on fire.

Around 50 firefighters have been brought in, along with 20 fire engines, more than a dozen rescue helicopters and support vehicles to tackle the blaze. Police are now treating the incident as a "major incident", which means that everyone living nearby should be warned of the emergency and those living nearby must be evacuated if given suitable notice.

According to BBC News, a local source told the BBC that workers were told that the plant was being treated to stop mould developing. The source said the site has had "years" of problems. The workers involved are unlikely to be paid for the time worked due to the loss of the plant.

Around 80 firefighters had arrived at the scene as part of the North West Joint Fire and Rescue Service. Many of those were drafted in from other forces including Merseyside and Greater Manchester
