 turmoil since it was taken over by private equity in 2012, appointed Dave Whelan to replace him.

"Since he took over, Mr Whelan has been taking ENO in a different direction from me, and that has led to us growing apart," said Evans. "That is something a co-founder would have to do in order to create a fresh start. After a difficult year, I want to move on. The ENO is now on a good footing, and Mr Whelan has the vision required for its next stage."

Evans was chairman of the ENO until 2014. He launched it in the mid-1970s, building it into a major festival with global reach. He stepped down from that role when he was hired last year by private equity firm KKR.

KKR helped rescue the ENO two years ago from "deep water", amid concern about the company's future.

Evans has been on leave since February, but his departure and the resignation of the company's chief executive, Julian Daley, come at a particularly difficult time for the company.

Daley's departure follows the resignation of two non executive directors and the departure of executive producer Peter Crampton this week. The ENO has also been called in by the city regulator, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

Daley was brought in last year to steer the company through a difficult period involving a decline in sponsorship and the arrival of the US festival Superfly, owned by promoter Larry Ellison.

But the ENO has also recently been hit by criticism of its approach to disability in its festival programme, as well as a row over the organisation's finances. Daley was also at pains to emphasise that the company was still run by Evans's successor Whelan, in a speech in April.

Evans will be replaced as chairman of the ENO by Daley and Whelan, who has served as chairman of several major British festivals including Glastonbury and Isle of Wight. The former director of the Royal Albert Hall has also been appointed as a non executive director.
