 by telling CGTN he wants "to play a positive role in the development of this region and contribute to the international community on sustainable issues."

"We have always been against government manipulation, be it ideological or in any other form," said Mr Ren, whose father founded Huawei more than 40 years ago. He has served as a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a largely rubber stamp advisory body for Chinese leadership decisions. Mr Ren remains one of the largest shareholders of the tech giant, which claims to have a market value of $150bn (Â£112bn).

Huawei's push into Africa has coincided with a US trade dispute with China, which the US claims has unfairly benefited Chinese firms by way of cheap loans and state interference. Huawei has denied the accusations, but Mr Ren emphasised the company's independence, saying it "is not bound by any foreign government". "This company is an independent organisation operating under the government's policy, we do not have a formal business relationship with the government," he said.

Mr Ren also sought to refute accusations his company is "worryingly close" to the Chinese military, an allegation fuelled by US President Donald Trump. "There's no justification [for the allegations]," he said. "We are a large firm, and we work in many different markets, including Europe and the US." Mr Ren rejected the notion that Huawei was beholden to Beijing. "We are not a state-owned company," he said. "We are a private entity, with a private owner."

Huawei's push into Africa dates back to 2012, but it has expanded its presence since then. It plans to build out its mobile-telecoms networks throughout the continent, and will launch a data centre in Kenya, although neither project is yet online. Its 5G network, which it insists will be available everywhere by 2025, will be rolled out in about 10 countries, Mr Ren said, promising that these would be African nations.
