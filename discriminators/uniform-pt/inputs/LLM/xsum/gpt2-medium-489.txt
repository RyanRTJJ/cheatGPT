 with a knee injury.

The Irishman spent his first year in charge in December 2013 as he finished fourth in the Premiership with a 14-7-7 record, despite playing just one Premiership season. While there were reports that he might leave the club, there was nothing further to confirm the news

But he is expected to continue working with his coaching team to ensure his career takes off.

The 33-year-old has scored 14 goals this season - the most by an Irish player in a single season since Barry's 19 during a three-year spell in 1998-99 - while also scoring 11 against the All Blacks and 10 against Warrington.

In his first year, the former Leicester Blues player won the Premiership title with Toulouse, but since then, he has gone on to win three French Clasico titles and three Champions Cup trophies.

Umaga is expected to begin his coaching career in Germany, and was expected to leave Irish Rugby league to join former assistant Peter Horwood's squad when the latter stepped down from his role at North Tipperary in late January.

But it has now been reported that Umaga will resume his position as assistant coach for the 2017/18 Premiership season against Munster on 29 September in the Guinness Pro12, with a date yet to be confirmed.

There are no official updates on the Irish situation at Thomond Park, with a statement from the club's media office saying: "The Irish Rugby Football Union continues to work with both club and player, and we can say at this stage, as we have throughout the years, that the key players are available for selection in the Rugby League World Cup.

"With two days to go before the World Cup we remain upbeat that everything is on track and we shall be in touch further as the season unfolds."

'Funnily enough, I'm here now'
