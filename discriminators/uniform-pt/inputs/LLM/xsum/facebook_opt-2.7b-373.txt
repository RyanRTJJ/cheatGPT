"I'm pretty disappointed," said the 25-year-old McColgan.

"It was my first 10,000m of the summer season and coming up against such world class competition. Almaz is such an inspiration for women in sports and I don't think I did enough.

"It's still pretty disappointing but it's the first and a learning experience and I hope I can improve on that in the future."

McColgan, who set a national indoor record of 30 minutes 36.92 seconds in the 5000m in 2013, had started brightly, getting involved in a breakaway group early on.

"The start was good," she added. "I started to lose my rhythm a bit but I just had to stick to my own pacing and not get upset.

"The next three laps were a bit choppy because of the conditions but I was just focusing on my own race."

McColgan is hoping to have a busy next two months as she tries to pick up the pieces after missing this year's world championships.

"The world championships were really disappointing and I didn't think I would get a wild card, so I want to come back and prove that I'm at the worlds and to win them," she said.

"I still have the 5000m coming up and the Commonwealths so I hope I get the chance to come back and show myself.

"I hope to get into the 10,000m trials."

Olympic silver medallist Sharon van Rouburg's attempt at a Diamond League double in New York ended when she finished fourth in a race won by world champion Caster Semenya.

The South African started strongly and was leading for the first two laps before finishing in a time of 31 minutes 40.20 seconds to go clear of Ethiopian Tsegaye Kebede and Britain's Gemma Spofforth.

Van Rouburg has an extensive winter schedule and has been busy securing qualification for the London 2012 Olympics.
