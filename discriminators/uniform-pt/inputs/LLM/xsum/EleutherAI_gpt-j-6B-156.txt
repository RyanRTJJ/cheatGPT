 £400,000 mortgage in April 2014 and not have to find a tenant in their lifetime if they didn't sell their property.

The Government has announced the limit will be reduced to £220,000 from April 2014.

The increase in limit, from £125,000 to £175,000 last year, was criticised by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) as an "attack on the house-buying habit".

The building societies also warned interest rates could rise, although the bank of England has said it would not act to stop rates of base interest rising.

Andrew Sentance from the trade body IFA's said: "The Government has failed in its attempt to get housebuilding on to a sustainable footing.

"They need to realise that the only way to get sustainable housebuilding off the ground is to lower the costs of borrowing and reduce uncertainty with regard to future rates. Housebuilders don't build unless there is a market and they need to see sustainable returns for their business to invest and grow."

The UK is in the midst of a long-term housing shortage - with 1.1 million people looking for a home in the UK, up 12% on a year ago.

The figures showed that house building rose by 15.8% in April - much higher than the 6.3% rate seen in March.

"What's encouraging is that the figure for May shows the strength of the recovery," said Mark Harris, deputy chief executive of the housing charity Shelter.

But he warned that the figures were still below pre-credit crunch levels.

Mr Harris said: "The pace of activity over the last 12 months is still far too slow compared to the previous boom, and we would need to see a marked improvement in the coming months to get the supply and demand situation back on a sustainable footing."

Martin Ward, founder of online estate agent Rightmove said he had not seen much change over the past two years on the housing front.

"We do expect to see a more active market in the coming months however," he said.

Homebuyers need to take action, or face seeing property values drop
