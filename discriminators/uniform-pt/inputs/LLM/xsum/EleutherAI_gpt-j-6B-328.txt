The ITC, which is chaired by Baron John Gummer, former cabinet minister, calls for radical changes to Britain's transport system and says it will be delivered between now and 2014.

A total investment of at least 2.3 trn pounds will be needed to tackle the problems identified in its report, which says that Â£2.2 trn has already been spent on transport, and that more is needed. But the ITC is less strident about what those investments should look like.

"That approach does not suit other people's needs but neither
