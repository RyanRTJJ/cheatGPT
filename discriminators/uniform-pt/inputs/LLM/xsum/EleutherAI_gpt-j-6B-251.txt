Experts are struggling to identify the creatures, but believe them to be ‘Jellyfish’. Jellyfish are a wide variety of cnidarian animal that can be dangerous due a variety of creatures.

It may be some sort of stinging cnidarian, I’m not sure.” said Dr Michael Wong, from the Centre for Health Protection, a part of the Department of Health. The government body claims it has also notified the relevant departments and has dispatched their inspectors to see if there are any further sightings in different parts of China.

But if I take time to look at it through the microscope, it’s a little more serious, because if it becomes an invasive species and starts to affect the local ecosystem, that’s a serious health safety risk.” he told AP.

Last year, the Hong Kong based Centre for Food Safety (CFS) announced an embargo on the sea creatures, warning people not to eat them.

In 2015, Hong Kong banned jellyfish from entering the territory’s territory after it caused several stings which resulted in one fatality, according to Bloomberg.

This family of jellyfish has been blamed for at least eight deaths in Asia over the past five years. In 2011, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the jellyfish killed 30-50 people annually in Japan, Taiwan, China and the Philippines.

“The problem is that if this jellyfish turns out to be invasive, it’s not a small problem. When we inspect and do laboratory tests with this jellyfish, this is a jellyfish that is highly invasive to marine environments, so
