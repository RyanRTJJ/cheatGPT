 Analysts said strong sales by rivals including Amazon, Apple, Walmart and Target showed that consumers were more willing to pay for brands that look and feel new and authentic.

The survey also found that UK retailers are more optimistic about the state of stores and are more likely to see sales increasing over the summer, after spending more on decorations and displays.

"It looks like UK shoppers are still quite willing to pay for new-design, better-looking, more premium products on the market," said Jana Koop-Sieber, the chairman of KPMG UK Retail, who presented the survey to an audience in London last week. "Clearly many brands have not yet got the response they would want to bring the business back to life. We have seen a bit of a revival in UK retail in the past few years, but for what it's worth, we still think there are some problems to fix."

KPMG's survey was carried out among more than 13,000 consumers who spend at least an average of £4.75 a week in UK stores. This data was collected at the end of March.

Although sales were soft compared with last year, and the number of people shopping more in the first half of 2015 has fallen, the KPMG survey found that the share of Britons spending more on products is still improving. In 2015, 56% of the population spent a total of more than £7.60 on goods or services, compared with 68% who purchased this amount in 2014.

Overall, the number of people who paid more for services in the first half of 2015 increased by 1% to 58%, and by 0.7% compared with the same period in 2014.

On sales, the KPMG survey found that UK shoppers had increased spending by 5.1% compared with the same period last year.

KPMG analysts said the survey revealed Britain's changing shopping culture and "high cost" environment. The British government announced plans to allow all retailers to sell goods cheaper than the UK's cheapest online rivals, Amazon and eBay, from July.
