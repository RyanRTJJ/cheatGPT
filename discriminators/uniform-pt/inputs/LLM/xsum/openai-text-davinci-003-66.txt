 Ireland school whilst Knocknagin is a Roman Catholic school.

Two consent forms will need to be issued, one for the Church of Ireland and one for the Roman Catholic Church. These should outline the proposed merger, its objectives, and the joint management plan. It is important for both Churches to clearly state that they agree to the proposed merger, so both consent forms should establish this in writing.

Once the consent forms are signed, they can be presented to the local Board of Governors who must approve the merger and the joint management plan. If the Board of Governors approves, they will present the forms to the Education Authority (EA) who will have the final say in whether or not the merger takes place. If the EA approves, the merger will be implemented. 

Finally, the EA must coordinate with other relevant bodies in order to ensure that the merger is implemented successfully. This will include notifying staff, parents, and the relevant Churches. The EA should also ensure that the joint management plan is continuously reviewed and updated in order to ensure that the merger remains successful and beneficial.
