 and police investigations were ongoing.

Victoria, 53, was found dead at the home on the 3107 block of Ota Road, off Erskine Highway at 10pm on Wednesday.

Paul, 49 of Newcastle, was arrested and will appear in court on Thursday.

Paul said his family were trying to get his attention at the time. He said he did not intend to hurt Miss Burke or to leave witnesses.

"I just went for a walk and when I came back I saw the door was locked.

"We were chatting and I said "Are your windows opened?" and she said no, and then I said, 'Well if you don't let the front door open I'm going to knock on the back door.

"I knocked on the window, and she opened the door."

Paul said she was intoxicated at the time they argued, was shaking and kept knocking on the window.

He said he then went away and she locked the door but he then unlocked the door, unlocked it again, pushed her aside, entered the house and hit her.

"I didn't touch her, I mean I couldn't see what I was doing.

"It was a blur. I'm only sorry for her family.

"I was just trying to defend myself. I could see her getting hurt so I just defended myself but she hit me first.

"I had to be aggressive.

"I don't hold grudges, I don't know how it happened.

"I had told the police I didn't touch her and I had told the court the same thing.

"Every police officer that came out was shocked I even told them, 'Victoria's dead, somebody's killed her.'"

His bail was denied and he remains behind bars on suspicion of causing death and grievous bodily harm.
