 underway by summer 2017. A spokesman said: "A partnership between Tourism Scotland and the UK's Government is at the heart of our vision for London. Our main priority will be to ensure Londonites can enjoy our outstanding transport options on the best and most value-add in the UK - it is our main aim to create a sustainable and comprehensive network across the city using the best technologies and best business practices to offer travellers the best of both worlds - both physical and virtual!"

The scheme is part of a £3bn "Green Belt" package under-funding which is now fully funded. A total of £4.5bn will be spent from 2017 onwards, to focus on the north east, which will form a key part of the scheme.

Transport Scotland's Transport Policy Committee will have its meeting in the Royal Courts of Justice in July this year.

It will report back in May on whether the scheme makes a difference to London's relationship with Wales.

Transport Minister Greg Clark said: "The government's 'Green Belt' scheme will enable passengers from the north-east of England and Wales - who will most likely spend a lot of time in London - to escape into Europe more easily, and also drive less traffic.

"However, that will cost money, and travel will be worse in parts of the country where London is already highly congested, and where tourism tourism and travel services are relatively scarce."
