Striker Diafra Sakho: "The first goal was something new for them; when you score a goal against a top team like that you have to be disappointed.

"I didn't want to stop the crowd from coming, we couldn't score and yet we won. I think the crowd are the best fans in football and I'm sure they have been crying in my dressing room all game. So if they can continue to do that then they need to be proud of us."

Former Nottingham Forest striker Ian Taylor: "It's the only game where I've been a regular member of the crowd and I've always wanted to see us win, so hopefully it's the beginning of a new era in West Ham."

Liam Bridcutt: "The difference between West Ham United and Sheffield United is that they have a very, very passionate and supportive fans and that's been evident at Saturday's match. I knew the fans were going to give everything to support them.

"It's a shame that I couldn't score my hat-trick because it would have been a great moment and something special for me. Hopefully I'll still be playing this week for England, and hopefully I'll still have a few more opportunities to score but I'd love to."

"There's more to come for us - it's a massive win and we're all looking forward to it. I think we showed our class. The fans have been amazing. We got the goal early but were frustrated at their resilience that we were able to score.

"We'll look forwards and look towards next round but we're all disappointed and there's nothing worse than a 0-0 draw."
