In 2013 the European Union’s European Court of Justice said the EU could not ban tobacco advertising.

It noted that the European Convention of Human Rights guaranteed freedom of expression under Article 10. But the EU was allowed to regulate in relation to public health if it was necessary for this purpose, the court said.

The EU argued that banning all forms of tobacco advertising and packaging was necessary because many adults who smoke tobacco use it to try to give themselves a sense of anonymity or disguise unhealthy habits.

Campaigners argue that tobacco advertising has a “deceptive appeal” to children and that it is easier for adult smokers to quit on their own than to give up cigarettes if they see cigarette brands as part of a lifestyle they associate with the youth.

The EU court noted that it was a violation of people’s right to respect private life and freedom of expression to ban such advertising because it is not directed to children but adults. “Adults who engage in such communication with children have no reasonable expectation of privacy, nor do they have a legitimate interest in hiding their identities,” the judgement said.

Ireland holds a referendum each time the EU adopts a new treaty. Last year, 71.4 per cent of voters rejected a back-to-back referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, fearing that the draft legislation to implement that treaty could give Ireland less control over EU policy.

The Lisbon agreement has been adopted and signed by the 27 EU countries, but has not yet been put to the referendum required by Irish law. The government has agreed to hold the referendum in the autumn of 2014.

France, Sweden and others have already voted to reject the compact, which will have more powers for the EU to control budgets. The 27 countries must adopt the compact by the end of 2013 by unanimous
