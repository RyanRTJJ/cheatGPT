 26, Tom Curran for 18, Jack White for 22, Matt Chittenden for 4, and Steve O'Driscoll, and Adam Houghton, for 19 each.

But West Indians made only 8 before lunch and fell to 137 but were on 187 for 5 just when they were on the cusp of victory. When the wicket of Jonny Bairstow gave them the lead again they were 63 for 10 at 44 runs from a single over.

In the second innings, West Indies reduced India to 48 for 1 with 12 overs left. O'Driscoll, who hit 33 in his last Test against West Indies, added two wickets to the hosts' two-wicket lead off 48 balls.

WICB commentator Steve Harmison said: "There was a lot of frustration in the West Indies side. There's a long-standing issue in the Caribbean, and unfortunately there's a long-standing issue in India."

The West Indies' bowling attack, which features three bowlers in the top 10, struggled to get moving.

"You know the story where everybody wants to bowl a no-ball. And he (West Indies coach Darren Sammy) didn't even put the bails in. And he has a no-ball policy which we didn't have. And that's probably the reason we could not take any wickets.

"I don't think the wickets that we lost were even close to the performance we had against Sri Lanka in the second innings; and I'm pretty sure that if we were to get the win that we should have got, I'd have been happy.

"We've lost some wickets in a good way - and the one we did lose was one that we should probably have taken - but it's important that we build the game and get a positive start."
