Police allege two of the women - identified as 18-year-old Anisa Nemlova, of Argyle Street, and 17-year-old Mariya Khusiev, of Wurundjeri Way - took the girls to the corner of Church Road and Argyle Street, where Mr Wilson's articulated truck was waiting. The men left the girls at a nearby bus station. The other girls were recovered from the Princes Highway, near Rundle, around 4am. Loading The boys returned at 8am to find two more lorries waiting. They also made it back to St Anne's College before the police arrived.

"All three boys walked back to the college and have expressed remorse about their actions," Detective Senior Sergeant Stuart McBeth said. "They have been described to us in the past as good students. "Anisa Nemlova is very frightened and is still under psychiatric care, while Mariya Khusiev is understood to have suffered moderate trauma." The women's ages and injuries are not known. Loading On Saturday, detectives visited the property where Mr Wilson died. The vehicle had been covered in a tarp. A vehicle similar to the one the girls were in was found nearby, with its doors open, abandoned. Loading Loading Officers also raided the Wurundjeri Way property linked to the brothers. Loading Loading At the scene, Detective Senior Sergeant McBeth said, it was difficult to identify what was left of Mr Wilson's body, because of the tarp on top of it. Loading "I don't know if it's a head or just a skeletal part. There's a couple of pieces that aren't intact, but there's nothing that would stop me from saying the body was that of Andrew Wilson in the vehicle," he said. Loading Loading The boys were arrested at 3.45pm yesterday.
