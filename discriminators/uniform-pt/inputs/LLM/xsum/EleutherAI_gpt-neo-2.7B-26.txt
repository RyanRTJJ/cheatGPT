 Jalal, gifted the visitors an insurance goal five minutes before the break.

Mills did not get the better of his opposite number at Tranmere. Indeed, on 13 July, Mills could only come close to opening his account for the season when he was the last man, following the last change, to reach his century of runs in the Football League in a 1-0 home win over Rochdale. He was only in goal when the game was under goalless.

'I must have been playing poorly because I thought I was losing,' Mills said afterwards. 'The first touch in goal was a world away from what the last five seconds saw. I was lucky to come back as soon as I did. On the other hand, it's only when you lose you learn. The more you win, the more you'll learn about yourself. I learned that my whole life is just trying to win.'

Mills' career would take a dramatic turn after he finally made his Football League debut on 16 October. He had not been required at Brentford, and in the next few weeks he was out of favour at Bristol City, then out of favour again when he signed for Burnley in January 1966. He had made a name for himself when he turned out for the youth team at Burnley under Jack Reynolds, the man who had turned his career around when he was a youngster, so it seemed right that a young man of his ability from the east coast should make a name for himself. With 20 caps for Scotland under-21 at the age of nineteen, Mills' career may not have taken off, but he had certainly blossomed. Burnley manager Tony Waddington was so impressed with the midfielder, he signed him up the next day in a deal that also brought Gary Stevens on loan from Manchester United. Mills would play a total of sixty-six times for Burnley across all competitions before being released in May
