's husband has also sent an SMS to the family.

An investigation was launched on Tuesday to determine what happened.

A Highland Council spokesman said: "The police had met with the mother and the father over the weekend and are aware of all the information on this front.

"It is hoped that the father may be able to help with the police investigation."

The family said they had to go on their own, as their house, which is in a different area, had been searched before.

A spokeswoman for Highland Council said: "The family were at an earlier point and are not being informed until it is time to move out."

An inquiry has been launched.

SUSPECTED

The mother contacted police immediately after the incident. The father did not do so until Wednesday evening, when he called his wife on her mobile phone.

"An officer knocked on her door and asked if she knew where her friend, Lola Campbell, was," a police spokesman said.

"If the mother did not know then the officer said another officer knocked on the door to ask: 'Are you concerned for her wellbeing?' The father subsequently called his partner over, who arrived at the house immediately and identified Lola as her daughter."

Lola is being interviewed over the incident which took place in the early hours of yesterday.

The spokeswoman added: "An initial search failed to locate Campbell," while detectives have searched Ms Bell's school and searched her parents' home on Sunday.

The mother has received a "verbal message" from Police Scotland to apologise for what happened.

Speaking this evening, Police Scotland spokeswoman Detective Inspector Laura McLeish said: "We have spoken to the mother, father and the victim, and we're in constant contact with them to ensure we are aware of developments as they occur.

"We were in touch with them yesterday. No further details at this time."
