sis, her parents had to take her 700 miles round-trip to London to see a specialist.

Molly’s story highlights how challenging it can be to access appropriate care for rare medical conditions, particularly when there are no formal diagnosis codes.

Molly’s parents, having exhausted the resources available to them in their local Newcastle hospital, did their own research to identify the sought-after specialist who, after many tests and scans, correctly diagnosed an intestinal motility disorder.

Following the diagnosis, Molly’s parents, with the help of the specialist, were able to create a personalized care plan for Molly’s condition, including changes in the size of her tube, medications, diet and lifestyle changes.

The National Health Service (NHS) has a long-standing commitment to providing excellent care for those with rare, chronic and life-limiting conditions — often at the expense of those with more common complaints.

Molly’s parents’ story is an example of how people can and do access healthcare in the UK despite their unmet needs.

The NHS has responded to the growing challenge of providing adequate and timely care for rare conditions by increasing its investment in specialist units, expanding its network of regional care centers and creating regional health systems dedicated to delivering personalized care for rare diseases.

Through the expansion of these services and for Molly and her parents, the NHS has created an improved response to rare conditions and improved access to essential healthcare for all those with unmet needs.
