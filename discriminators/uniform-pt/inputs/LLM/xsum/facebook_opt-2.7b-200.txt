 country's major ISPs asking for a detailed inventory of websites offering pirated Bollywood videos.

The Bollywood film industry has been struggling to control the piracy of their films for many years, and in this latest move, a government agency has asked ISPs across India in regards to websites that are hosting pirated Bollywood content.

The email from the Government of India's Department of Telecommunication to eight major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) outlines how they should be reporting to the government regarding the pirating of their content and how they can be used as tools to combat piracy.

In the email, ISPs are asked to provide a full list of websites in their control that are providing pirated copies of Bollywood films to Indian Internet users. The email points out that if ISPs "fail" to comply with this list, then the Department of Telecom will take disciplinary action against those ISPs. This means that ISPs could face penalties and even loss of their right to do business with the government.

The panel also proposed that online piracy services, such as the pirate site The Pirate Bay, be shut down as soon as possible. The country's telecom department has now made clear its stance on online piracy by urging ISPs to report any infringing content they find.
