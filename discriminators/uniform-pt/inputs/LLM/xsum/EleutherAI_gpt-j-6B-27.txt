 with fan body SPFL Fans For FairPlay.

The decision to follow the example set by the Scotland Under-21 side was announced after a series of fan votes.

The voting process, which was promoted with the slogan 'We want to change the colour of our national team's shirt' - after a poll on Sportscotland's website revealed just over a third of fans wanted the national team to remain in red - was overseen by a two-man panel made up of MSP Jackie Baillie and MSP Andrew Murray and chaired by SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster.

The poll also proved to the first step towards deciding which other clubs would be invited to join the SPFL's 12-member Fan Council.

In addition the voting process led to the launch of the 'Make It Blue' campaign, which promotes blue as the new home colour of the Scottish sport.

The decision is another example of the sport's increasing focus on fan engagement, with fans invited to take part in the voting process that will influence the decision to change or keep the jersey the same colour.

SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said: "Change is never easy and never comfortable, but our new club by club Fan Council will help us to make this decision an even process on behalf of the whole football community and we believe that the Scottish public are overwhelmingly happy with this decision.

"And if there's an issue or a discussion point not covered well enough in the Fan Council's process and the process with fans in each club, we will open it up to the public and engage with as many people as we can."

The SPFL Fan Council will remain in place for the next two seasons - through until the end of 2014-15 - and will be chaired by MSP Jackie Baillie and MSP Andrew Murray.

They will consult with the clubs on issues concerning fans and their relationship with the SPFL, as well as engaging with the public on areas such as the design element
