The picture is even more staggering, with 4.7 million pupils in the south achieving five of the six Good GCSEs, compared to 4.5 million pupils in the North.

The figure is a huge bump from figures that showed 8.2 million pupils in the south attained five GPs.

The figures from the National Institute of Education show that from 2006 onwards, pupils in north east Scotland were getting two-thirds more than south east people, while from 2006 onwards, pupils in north west Scotland were getting two-thirds more than south east people.

There were four consecutive months when that number had reached 4 million students in North Wales, just as the Northlands were getting two-thirds more than the South Wales.

It is expected to increase slightly in the year to August. Figures presented by the Department for Education last September showed that 774 out of 770 schools in south east Scotland had an increase in pupils in May – down from 551 in the same time a year earlier.

As a result, the number, estimated by the Department for Education, has increased 10.5 percent and the number of children in North Wales is expected to rise 14 percent.

Ministers have admitted that many pupils in northern areas were able to succeed because they had a school curriculum which worked, including a better understanding of English. The Department for Education, a key campaign arm for the school reform campaigns, has highlighted a "school
