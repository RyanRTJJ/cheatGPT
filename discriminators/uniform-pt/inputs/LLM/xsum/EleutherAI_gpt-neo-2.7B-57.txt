ance to some that cause injury to others and that this is particularly concerning to those in the area who live and work on site while participating in events."

Stewart is a city councillor in Newmarket and said he often uses the downtown area during the holiday season.

He added people of all ages, from infants to seniors, were not well-travelled and were not safe.

"I don't believe that people who participate in events like this are looking at themselves in the mirror for the rest of their lives," he said.

"I've heard a lot of complaints from people who have to clean up after events. There is something wrong somewhere."

Coun. Steve Pailloux said there is enough space at the event to move the vehicles.

"It is in fact a very short distance from the event to the side yards and grass areas which are available for people parking on the public street," he said. "It seems to me that you could certainly make some modifications if you have an issue with parking and could use some help."

Police were still considering the possibility of charges but are not ready to make any decisions.

They did say they will provide more patrols around the event.

"At this point we are encouraging people to be aware, especially during this holiday season, to be responsible and think about the safety of their guests and of themselves and their staff," said Const. John Sidwell.

The council will discuss this during a December meeting.

I have to say it was pretty amazing seeing all the cars on that hill with all the signs that said people could bring their cars to make a few bucks.

The council also agreed to a request for the site's parking, which is $2.99 a day, which is much cheaper than the regular municipal lot on the other side of town.

As for the bonfire site, Coun. Mike Solic said there was a lot of interest in the location and "an amazing turnout."

He said the city of Winnipeg is working on its own parking policy. "People have this sense that we are a free-for-all, a free-for-all. When you build something, people think it is free," Solic said
