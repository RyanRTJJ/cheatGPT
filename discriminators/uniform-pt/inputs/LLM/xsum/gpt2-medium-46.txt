 my mind is not in my training because I have not heard anything yet because of the weekend but I shall report once they tell me it has happened," Shevchenko said.

"My intention is to compete but for this to happen, she had better be quick. I don't know what could happen. She has already been denied to any match. She will do well in the tournament and will play for Russia again next year."

Majdan Krabiakov, the Russian's coach, said he believed that Shevchenko and the rest of the squad should have had that day off.

Krabiakov said the decision would have been better left to the authorities, rather than the WADA commission, had his country not failed the test. "I do not see Hervchenko playing in a tournament like the one in Russia next year," Krabiakov said.

On the eve of Saturday's match, the Ukraine's president, Leonid Tibonyush, said the ban would not have a "positive impact on our national culture". "We are not against the sport, we're with sportspeople," Tibonyush said.

He said he believed the rules intended to prevent the doping of other people, and would apply to all athletes. "I feel like the rule protects the anti-doping authorities but also allows the individual anti-doping officers to decide who can compete, who can not," Tibonyush said. He also said any other rules in the rule book were up to the federation's member federations to follow.

The commission, which in practice is an executive committee comprised of representatives of several federations - including Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkey - has said it is prepared to change the rules, but not without debate.

Czech president Milo≈° Zeman and the Russian, Aleksey Kovtun, both said in an interview with Kommersant TV station on Friday that they did not intend to introduce any new test, and they did not find the current form of doping to be a sufficient measure.
