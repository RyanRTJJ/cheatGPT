 Analysts for the BRC told CNBC the year-over-year gains were due largely to weaker currency and lower oil prices.

The overall sales were higher than predicted by analysts. However, analyst estimates put the figures as high as 30 billion lira, or $4.8 billion, above the BRC's forecast, while the BRC said the sales would rise by 7% in the first quarter, rising to 32 billion lira.

On average, the sales rose 5.4% year-over-year.

U.S. shale gas production, driven partly by hydraulic fracturing, a process used to break rock, boomed during the oil boom. There are signs U.S. shale production could pick up again in 2015 and 2018, with production rising 1.1% in 2014; 2.7% in 2013; and 6.4% in 2012.

However demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) will likely continue to rise in 2014, with the BRC forecasting 1.4% higher production and 3.9% higher output growth this year, with growth accelerated to 4% and 10% in 2014 and 2015 respectively. While the boom may accelerate, more production growth can mean higher prices for foreign consumers, and the supply of imported natural gas to the U.S. could be constrained to meet growing domestic demand for home gas, which will rise in 2014, according to the BRC.

In an interview following the report, John Taylor, an analyst at Jefferies in Santa Cruz, CA, said the U.S. natural gas market had been "flattened" last year due to the fracking boom and that in the third quarter, energy prices rose 6.3%, on which the BRC said rising prices offset declining gas demand from oil and gas projects.

The BRC said U.S. natural gas demand increased 2.8% in October from September, and 1.3% in August. Both figures are consistent with the first quarter numbers, though the figures for the September figures are adjusted by the change in accounting for natural gas storage.
