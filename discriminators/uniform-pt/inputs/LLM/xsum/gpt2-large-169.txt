 mild symptoms in adults, only a temporary blindness in some cases, and no birth defect.

The World Health Organisation issued new recommendations on 23 October saying that Zika could be spread at home within three months if female mosquitoes carrying the virus are in a warm-air-conditioned environment, since the virus is not transmitted from person to person but mainly by female Aedes mosquitoes.

The new guidelines say: "It is prudent to avoid mosquito-transmitted Zika virus infection. The virus does not cause any serious symptoms and should not be associated with a serious event, including: heart disease, skin lesions, seizures, or severe vision loss."

The WHO said any travellers with symptoms of the virus should attend a medical appointment. "If symptoms start six weeks after they have arrived in the country and continue for 12 weeks, you should seek medical attention and see your GP," the WHO recommended.

WHO has called for the entire world to follow its advice.

In a report, the agency said health officials had not yet been able to identify any other countries whose transmission of Zika virus seemed to increase if people had close contact with infected mosquitoes.

One in four people in south-east Asia and the Pacific region were infected by Zika virus, and two in five are believed to be infected in the United States, the report said.

In the Americas and Asia, Zika is expected to be the dominant virus the next few years. The mosquitoes that spread the virus mostly have the capacity to fly, not spread the virus.

While some countries are reducing reliance on imported pesticides for control and are adding mosquito nets to public buildings, others are doing little to tackle the problem.

A report released by the World Environment Group, a London-based environmental NGO, on Thursday revealed that more than half of countries that have introduced measures to fight Zika are not doing enough to help the populations that benefit the most.

"If you're trying to fight these mosquitoes, how can you not see that there's an awful lot of people affected?" said John O'Malley of the WHO.

The WHO's own risk assessment on the mosquito-spread outbreak of dengue and Chikungunya virus shows just how difficult the mosquito control effort has been: in
