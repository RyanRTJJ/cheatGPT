'Lack of progress'

On Thursday, the Organisation of American States recommended Venezuela suspend talks with opposition leaders in Washington and accused it of undermining democracy in the crisis-hit South American country.

The group is due to meet later on Friday to consider possible measures against the Maduro government, which has refused to recognise its legitimacy.

Opposition politicians and analysts have speculated about the opposition's reaction and, in a sign of how tense things have got, some protesters have been looting supermarkets.

The crisis has been deepening for months but the opposition saw little chance of victory in Sunday's vote.

But the opposition's confidence collapsed on Monday, after Mr Maduro said the referendum would be "legally binding".

Brazil's secretary of state for Latin America says Venezuelan officials must not "use legal procedures" against election observers "and put democracy in the country at risk".

Venezuela's constitution enshrines the president as "immune" from any kind of recall referendum.

The opposition launched a boycott of parliament in protest at Mr Maduro's announcement on Sunday. They are demanding he call fresh elections, hold a dialogue with the opposition and "face down that dictator", the speaker of the lower house, Diosdado Cabello.

Opposition activist Maria Corina Machado had been detained since the vote and faces charges of conspiracy, rebellion and inciting violence.
