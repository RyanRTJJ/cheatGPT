 a two-times British national time trial champion.

The organiser of the event, Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research, said: "It is very shocking information and clearly an extremely sad day for the whole team."

He added: "The RAC is currently assisting the emergency services with our on-site doctors and equipment to provide any medical support that the ambulance and the RAC require to support the emergency services.

"In the meantime, our thoughts and sympathies are with Rene, his family, colleagues and friends at the moment."

Mr Chard's team manager Richard Jones said: "The cycling community is in shock. It's always difficult losing someone like Renato. We are going to miss him and he'll be in our thoughts."

It is thought that on Sunday evening as his team set off he suffered a heart attack.

He had no family or children, his girlfriend was by his side and his teammates and friends are also grieving.

Mr Chard was an Olympic silver medallist and three-time Tour de France rider, winning the prologue in 2002 and 2004 and the stage 12 mountains classification in 2003. He was the first Briton to wear the yellow jersey on the Tour in 2003.

Renesburgh's chief executive, Simon Beale, said: "Renato was a great guy, a great rider, a great team mate and a kind-hearted, generous person. He always made people smile. What a great character he was."

He said: "Rene was truly loved by all of Renesburgh Cycling. He will be missed so much."

The company - based in the village of Rennesburgh near Bicester - ran three races a year from October to March with riders from the company.

The last event was held on 18 March and was won by David Millar.

Cyclists wear shorts and a single-breasted, long-sleeved jersey during races. After the Giro d'Italia in mid-June, there will be no British riders in that race, which starts two weeks before the Tour
