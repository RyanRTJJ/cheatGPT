 were sold across Scotland during this time, and the average selling price of £145,611 made it the best quarter of 2017.

In total, 11,542 properties changed hands for £5m or more with Edinburgh recording the most expensive average sales price since 2010 with £425,942 sold on average. Glasgow was the second most expensive with £391,637 sold, followed by Perthshire (£379,988), Lothian (£367,831) and Fife (£344,962).

Sale prices rose on an average of 7.7% across Scotland in 2017, and 1.1% in Glasgow. Aberdeen and Edinburgh achieved the highest average price growth in Scotland's regional markets (8.7%).

Average house prices have now climbed for eight consecutive months and the RoS expects house prices to continue rising through the first four months of 2018 before levelling out of late spring 2018.

While new buyers accounted for 31.6% of sales, buyers aged between 45 and 54 accounted for 43.4%. Young first time buyers accounted for an additional 21.0%.

Scotland’s first sales of 2018 were expectedly slow with only 1066 properties bought in the first three months of the year. Average prices are up on 2017 (1.1%) on the back of rising interest rates, with average sellers now enjoying an average return of 5.9% (up from 2.4% in the last quarter of 2016).

While the general economic environment in Scotland remains robust across the board, Scotland’s regions are all seeing some of the highest selling prices on record.

Edinburgh

Edinburgh is the top destination for 2018 so far. The Scottish capital has enjoyed some of the highest growth outstripping most of the other regional markets, rising 7.7% for the last 12 months. Over the first three months of this year, Edinburgh is up by 8.5%, and the market is continuing to build over winter with a further 7.5% up on December.

Average prices are now £425,942 in the city, a new all time high for the city. Over the last decade, average prices of £350,000 have been the highest price.
