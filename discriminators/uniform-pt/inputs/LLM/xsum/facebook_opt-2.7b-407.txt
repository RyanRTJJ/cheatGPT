 sometime between 1500 and 1950, but they may not be able to pinpoint his life, occupation or religious faith. The University of Oxford's Institute of Archaeology said the discovery was "hugely exciting" and could open new opportunities for the study of medieval England, even those who had assumed St John's College had little of such importance.

Dr Tim Aikin, Director of the University's Research Laboratory at St John's College, said: "The idea that the foundations of a medieval collegiate religious house may also have housed a man whose significance far outweighs any other remains is hugely exciting.

"Our long-term plan is to sequence his genome to understand his medical condition and see what he's got in terms of genetic material."

Archaeologists hope that genetic and chemical analysis of the bones within Context 958 has not been lost by the centuries' long journey from the church to the excavations in South-East London.

While one set of bones discovered in the church's crypt may have had a purpose other than burial, experts believe Context 958 was once a home to an older person, who is likely to have died at some point after the 1500s and before the mid 20th century. The skeletons were found largely intact in four coffins and they are believed to be those of two men.

Excavations started in April and finished in July, when ground was disturbed to reveal the remains and enable them to be carefully preserved.

The church was built in the late 12th Century for the benefactor Hugh De Lacy and was subsequently handed over to St John's College.

After centuries of neglect, the church was restored in 2014 and its medieval core, which dates back to the 12th Century, was demolished. Underneath the tower and crypt, four coffins were discovered.

A team of archaeologists led by Mr Aikin, who is also a Fellow of the College and Professor of Early Christian Architecture, has spent the past six years reconstructing St John's church alongside structural and historical experts.

The archaeology of St John's church is part of a much larger project to understand
