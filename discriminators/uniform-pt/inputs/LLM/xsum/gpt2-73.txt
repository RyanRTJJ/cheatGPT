 that pedestrians at Times Square have pushed out of the city's sidewalks. "We have had numerous complaints because people have taken more personal actions around Times Square than ever," councilwoman Liz Johnson said in a statement. "I'm deeply disappointed by what is happening on New York's streets but hope this has a solution to the issues of pedestrian plazas."

Possible Trump-induced escalator delays, after the mayor proposed a 2-D maze to make Manhattan more crowded

City council members on Monday made a final push to revive a controversial MTA parking subsidy, with the goal of making public transit more accessible. The proposal would cut the subsidy from an estimated 40 million dollars to 15 billion dollars over five years and add up to $6 billion at the end of 2017-18. Several lawmakers have suggested using it up to $10 billion in 2018.

That does not take into account any increases in fares after 2018 until that year.

If passed, the vote would allow New York Rail Transportation Authority (NYRTA) to reauthorize its program that allows trains to ride on the city's elevated platform and into public transit as part of the $9 billion MTA plan that expires in 2021. Those proposals would go to President Donald Trump's desk.

The funding would be provided by the Federal Transit Administration, which would control the authority's planning.

The proposal comes in response to a question about an estimated $17 million in budget cut that Metrolinx would be holding back as a result of a planned $15 billion maintenance upgrade of Metrorail New York, which could take six years.
