 in the back, I want my players to feel welcomed at the top of the field," said a strong defender. "I'm just excited to get back because that's the way I played with the Australian team and to continue to do what I'm trying to do."

Ricky Vurta was involved in a number of key moves throughout the match, with both teams' options ranging from winger Jarryd Hayne to centre Mitchell Pearce to winger Aaron Finch. Vurta, who has been at West Ham since 2010, also played right-back David Warner.

A ball from U.S. No. 14 to U.S. No. 17 was sent straight into the back of the net for the third Australia goal of the match - a goal that was credited to Wayne Rooney. The U.S. could have had a much more favourable look when they turned around the 20 for 16, which was also a more favourable look for South Africa.

But the U.S. got their goal back by turning the ball over in the half, the same play-off goals made by United all game who turned aside the ball and scored in the final minute in a thrilling 0-0 draw. It was just that good.

The U.S. responded brightly with the ball,
