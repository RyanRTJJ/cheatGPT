 if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her physical or mental health.

The Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended since January 2017, leaving the government unable to pass new legislation on the matter. As a result, the UK Government has been in talks with politicians in Northern Ireland in order to secure a new abortion law. However, various proposals have not resulted in any tangible changes and the UK Government is now ultimately responsible for ensuring that the law is compliant with human rights law.

The UK Government has stated that it is committed to meeting its responsibility for human rights compliance in Northern Ireland and will be engaging with the Northern Ireland Executive in order to ensure that the law is brought into compliance with human rights. It has also established a new cross-departmental team to ensure that this work is done effectively and quickly in order to ensure a prompt resolution to the issue.

In addition, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May has said that she is “personally committed” to ensuring women in Northern Ireland are granted abortion rights, and that her government is working on a “timely and sensitive” solution.

The UK Government is aware that it must take swift and decisive action to ensure that the law in Northern Ireland complies with human rights law, in order to protect the rights of women. It has already taken some steps in this direction, but it is clear that more needs to be done to ensure that women’s rights in Northern Ireland are not violated.
