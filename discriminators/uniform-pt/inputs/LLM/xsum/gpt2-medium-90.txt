 to provide special software to allow them to be plugged into a battery charger for up to 18 hours, while those with the 2.0L engine would need to receive an updated car battery that can accommodate either charger.

He added: "Although the use of electronic devices may increase convenience, a significant issue will be overuse of the electronic devices and whether the batteries are fully charged and ready for delivery. We will also work with the UK Government and third parties to ensure any devices are properly fitted on cars before they are delivered."

As the car companies and Nissan and Renault are likely to be keen to avoid any suggestion of a widespread installation of electric chargers, and have sought additional assurances from the Environment Agency that the systems will survive as the fuel supply goes offline, the project has been set up to minimise disruption to people's lives and to avoid further environmental damage.

The plan to put electric chargers on cars will start with the introduction of the Nissan Leaf in the UK under a scheme which has raised â‚¬300m. By 2020, Nissan hopes to introduce 20 electric vehicles, with the total number being up to 50% more powerful than petrol cars. Nissan also plans a fleet of petrol and diesel vehicles under the 1.8L variant.

The UK government has granted Nissan a licence which allows the introduction of EVs in 30 of its national fleet of up to 100 EVs. The carmaker will supply the car fuel for the next six years and will provide an electric starter when the next vehicle enters production.

A spokeswoman for the EPA confirmed that: "In total, there are a total of 33 countries which have passed legislation or regulations that allow consumers to switch to EV fuels of their choice."

Nissan said that it, too, has begun to investigate the possibility of installing the same amount of lithium-ion battery charging stations each time a new electric car is fitted with any of its electric models. However, when it comes to
