The first two Davis Cup ties have gone against Croatia and Britain are already three matches down, but Smith is confident his side can make an example of the side coached by two-time European champions Ivan Ljubicic and won titles in 2005 and 2008.

"But we are confident and we feel we have done a little bit with the preparation we have done. It is now about putting it into practise."

Smith is set to face Croatian former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic tomorrow, and was reluctant to say whether the match would be a battle for his own fitness.

"We'll see what the conditions are like in the match," said Smith. "I know what I need to be fresh for, but it's the conditions that I will be under-prepared for.

"Playing a match when it is overcast and with the wind will be very different to when it is drizzly and with no wind."

The 31-year-old former top-10 player has played in the fourth round at four Grand Slam tournaments in the last six months, with a tie against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga having been the standout result, before losing to Robin Soderling in five sets.

Smith feels he has taken the bad times out of his game and hopes to turn them into positives by moving forward at Wimbledon.

"I think this year I have played the best tennis of my life," he said.

"If I think back to last year, I was on the verge of a deep run at a Grand Slam, losing in Australia to a big-serving player.

"Last year, I played one bad match in the fourth round of Wimbledon and that was a massive turning point for me.

"I didn't lose the match, but I played terrible and didn't have confidence. This year I've been able to turn it around and been a lot more consistent and played the best tennis of my life this year."

He added: "
