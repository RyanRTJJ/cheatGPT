 children.

The children have had to cope with severe behavioural problems with their mum and dad.

Marianne D’Arcy from Mid Fermanagh Council explained: “We will be supporting the families until the Easter recess because we are looking after these children. “We are providing social care and we are looking at developing a way of them getting back to work.”

She has also urged people to make sure they have enough food and fuel in their homes. A number of families are now staying together because of the crisis.

She emphasised: “People can go to a fuel point, there are one or two in this area. “People can get free food parcels, there are a number of collection points throughout this area. There is a small shop called McAlinden’s (a market shop in Castlewellan which the council is supporting). “People can call us – Mid Fermanagh Careline – and we will offer advice to people.”

The children cannot attend school and the school’s headteacher in Castlewellan, Brendan McManus, explained: “They have been having severe behavioural problems.”
