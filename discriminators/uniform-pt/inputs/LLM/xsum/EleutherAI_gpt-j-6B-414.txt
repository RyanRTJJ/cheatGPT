The World Health Organization said the disease is linked to cases of microcephaly -- a brain disorder marked by a small head size that can be life-threatening -- and other neural complications in babies.

The number of cases of microcephaly rose from 33 in January and February to 79, officials said. Brazil said another 11 children had died from Zika-linked birth defects between Feb. 1 and Monday, nearly double the previous toll.

"The increasing incidence of Zika-associated microcephaly indicates that the time to act is now," WHO's director general, Dr. Margaret Chan, said at a press conference. "We are deeply concerned that Zika virus infection may impact public health and the economy in an enormous way in many of the countries most affected."

Chan said some of the worst-affected areas, such as French Polynesia, Mexico and Brazil, needed to begin "immediate" work on preventing the spread of the virus and reducing transmission. About 200 cases of Zika have been recorded around the world, according to the WHO.

But Brazil has the most significant outbreak.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell urged all Americans traveling outside the country to be aware of the virus risks and to consult state and local health authorities on the potential health threats.

"We will do everything within our power to protect travelers and U.S. citizens from Zika," Burwell said.

Brazil has asked the WHO to assess the situation and provide recommendations by the end of March.

"The fact that this is the first time this virus has been present for this long in the Americas is very surprising," WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan told reporters in Geneva. "I think we are at a time of testing. We are entering the new phase and we have to learn quickly, but we
