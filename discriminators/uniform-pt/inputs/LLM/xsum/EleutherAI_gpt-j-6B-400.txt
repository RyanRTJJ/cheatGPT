ager Katey Taylor, from Birtley, won third place for her thriller A Strange Christmas, which is set in the remote Scottish highlands.

The awards follow the success of last year’s debut fiction writing course, run by writers Emma Henderson and Pauline McLean, which has already helped seven writers to find publishers and launch new books.

Emma told The Courier: “It was very successful last year. A number of writers took the course and we have already had books published as a result. So this win shows the quality of writing that it has created across a range of genres and the variety of techniques.”

Emma said the course has been extended due to its success. “Two to start with next year and five in total.”

As well as the writing course, Emma and Pauline run a year-long writing intensive, called New Pages, for emerging writers.
