 say this structure could eventually extend across much of the solar system, including Earth and weirder worlds beyond Pluto's orbit."

The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope will be making what has been touted as its biggest solar observatory so far, when it launches in 2017 for the next phase of its mission to find Earth's home in the universe.

The telescope will also gather a spectacular view of the giant planets Jupiter and Uranus.

It will also look for the tiny moon Charon and the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

The New Radio Telescope will be used to scan our Universe for more than 700 other objects with which Earth and other cosmic beasts share most of the mass we can detect.

"They're just the beginning of the list," said Phil Crider of the radio astronomy research group of the Smithsonian National Observatory in Alexandria, Virginia.

"Our next step will be to make an international search for all of them, from stars and galaxies to stars and planets themselves."

He added: "The search for every one of these planets is just beginning. In five years' time, we'll probably know where they are because the sky will have cleared, so we'll know if they are habitable."

The New Radio Telescope will receive funding from Nasa, and will run four years from now - three years later than planned.

"New observations will likely make the New Radio Telescope a useful instrument for our understanding of all the objects in the universe but more important for studying the very early universe," explained the telescope's chief designer, Dr Alan McQuaid.
