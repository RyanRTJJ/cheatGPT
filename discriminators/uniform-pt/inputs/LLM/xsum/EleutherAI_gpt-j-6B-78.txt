 and is facing charges in the Supreme Court for denying the alleged involvement by the IRA.

The party leader had been on bail for several months, and the trial could begin within two months, in October.

The Sinn Féin president's lawyer, Fionnuala Ní Aoine, insisted the "charges are not politically motivated" and that Adams "has not been singled out and treated differently from others".

Adams, who was the IRA's chief of staff during the 1970s, has always insisted he did not know where Mrs McConville's remains were buried.

The remains of a woman who vanished as she went out of the kitchen door of her home 37 years ago and was never seen alive again have been found and re-united with her family.

The body of Mary Loughrane, 46, who vanished while walking to the shops in 1975, has been found at a site in Dungloe, Co Donegal, and has now been handed over to her parents in Armagh, Northern Ireland.

After a tense three day search that involved a number of Gardaí and the National police force divers in several locations around Lough Gowna, near Ballyshannon, last week, the body of Mary was discovered in a lake. She had been shot with a number of times around the head and chest. Mary, the eldest of the four Loughrane children, is believed to have been abducted as a reprisal for her father and brother Joe's fatal murder by an outlawed loyalist gang in 1975.

Gardai believe Mary was a volunteer worker with the Northern Trust, which supplied goods for the Republican movement, when she disappeared.

Dessie McCaughey (46), a friend of her brother Joe's, was shot twice in the early hours of 24 February 1977 as a reprisal for several IRA members having been killed in reprisal attacks in west Belfast.
