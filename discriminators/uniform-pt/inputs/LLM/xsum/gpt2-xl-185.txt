"That's not the point, it's a question of timing," May told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show on June 26. "If you ask me the question will that be sufficient for people to know what they have to vote for? I think you need to look at the bigger picture. The bigger picture is that I think Britain will succeed once we leave the European Union."

She added: "I do think we have to do this in a way which is properly co-ordinated and that's why I have set up a cross-party committee to work with this business department and with the Treasury on what an exit deal looks like."

She declined to state what options the government would pursue once that process has been defined.

She told ITV: "There will be no point in having a system where people take a route to access other countries for purely political reasons. That undermines people who are already here, we've got to be able to offer a route for people to keep the benefits they're entitled to in that other country."

She said she did not think anyone could challenge the right of EU citizens to apply for citizenship while they were still in the country.

She has said she supports some form of free movement but is committed to a system in which Britain continues to make full use of its benefits system.

May's reluctance to set out a full policy on immigration has drawn criticism from some other EU member states who fear it could lead to a decline in cross-border co-operation with the UK.
