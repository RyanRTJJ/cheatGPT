It is unclear if Sprint will offer Sprint Unlimited (the deal-breaking unlimited data option) again

Sprint's decision to remove the unlimited option in the app shows that it is looking at all of their options and moving toward a model that puts customers first. We have seen similar moves from T-Mobile, Sprint, and Verizon but the Sprint Unlimited removal is the first where the customer was the one to make the decision.

To be clear, the move isn't being done because customers are unhappy but due to security reasons. While the company has never admitted to compromising customer data, it has historically made exceptions for situations that involve special circumstances. With unlimited data gone, you have to wonder whether that is being followed for the unlimited plan.

It's important to note that Sprint isn't the only carrier that has made a change recently to remove the unlimited option. Verizon also has a limited number of high speed unlimited plans, with the rest offering high data limits. The other carriers might still offer unlimited plans.

It's interesting that both T-Mobile and Verizon have a limited number of unlimited plans. Perhaps they are trying to limit the potential problems that come with offering unlimited plans or may have been trying to protect a certain business model.

The good news is that Sprint has some good alternatives it can offer besides an unlimited plan. All new customers will be able to get a limited use discount when they bring their old phone to a Sprint store so there is still something available to attract new customers. These discounted plans can be found here.

As of today Sprint's unlimited option still isn't available outside of the US at no additional charge. However, this does change soon.

Do you think that AT&T or Verizon should follow Sprint's lead and offer unlimited plans again? Is this just an anomaly that will not be repeated?
