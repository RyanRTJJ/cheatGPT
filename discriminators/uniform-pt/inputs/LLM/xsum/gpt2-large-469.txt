 believe capital punishment is the only penalty he or she wishes would remain on the books, down from about seven-in-ten in 1996, after the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty for some prisoners.

"That number is down a few percentage points over a period of 40 years or so," Pew says. "The decline in support reflects a general shift toward less negative attitudes toward the death penalty in recent years."

Other studies have looked at attitudes towards capital punishment and found a similar pattern, though on a broader scope of topics; the only difference is that these studies were conducted before the death penalty went back on the national agenda.

According to the Center.

There has been a steady decline in the percentage of Americans who say that they think police should use deadly force when responding to a domestic dispute involving a physical altercation, and from 43% in 1990 to 29% in 2011. In addition, the percentage of Americans who say that police use excessive force when responding to a physical altercation has dropped from 54% in 1990 to 43% in 2011.

Just over half (52%) of Americans favor the death penalty for some nonviolent drug offenders, while 40% say that such a punishment is too harsh. Fifty-nine percent also favor the execution of four men who killed two people and wounded two others in New England by firing squad in 1979; support for the practice has surged since 1999.

Support for capital punishment has been falling in every state, although it has been declining since the late 1990s in the most conservative states of West Virginia, Michigan and Pennsylvania and rising in the most liberal states of New Mexico, Arizona, Louisiana, and Vermont.

Overall, 43% of Americans say that they oppose the death penalty, and 22% say they favor it. About four-in-ten Americans support capital punishment for crimes involving one of six violent offenses, which includes murder and rape.

The survey was conducted from April 19 to May 18 among 2,012 adults nationwide; margin of error is +/- 2%.
