 brought to Belfast Sheriff court, and then taken into care in a rented cabin on 23 December 2003.

According to the BBC, Mr Fitzgerald was convicted of the crime when police questioned him about a suspicious package he was carrying.

A statement from the Sinn Fein executive, Sinn FÃ©in and the NUI and Defence Executive said: "Despite the acquittal and conviction, the Government has expressed hope that the case will finally be resolved as the decision is made by the Northern Ireland Prison Service.

"A new set of facts could allow us to clarify both what occurred whilst it is now being questioned and how long Mr Fitzgerald had been serving.

"There is no doubt that when the case was being brought before the Court of Appeal it could have been very, very difficult for the NUI and other senior bodies to work together to make sure that as many people as possible were found to be capable of being trusted and of being given the justice they deserve.

"The investigation into the disappearance of Mr Fitzgerald has been well underway. The results of that investigation have yielded a statement from the SIS. Although it has not been fully revealed how Mr Fitzgerald was placed in the care of the SIS officers during that period, it is understood he had been receiving care from the SIS a number of times over the following years, including within the last six months.

"The SIS has been unable to comment on any possible future matters.

"If they are aware of this, they will be making such a statement."

On 30 February 2004 Mr Fitzgerald and the rest of his three young sons were led to his apartment by the man known only as Agent Frank (also known as Jack or Fenton) in an unmarked car which was parked outside the Ballymun House estate in Derry.

Mr Fitzgerald said the car involved in the car chase and shooting had been stolen.
