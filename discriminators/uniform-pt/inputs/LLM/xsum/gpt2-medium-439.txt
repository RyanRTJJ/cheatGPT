 can find along the sea route, from Eritrea to Macedonia, by the end of the day Thursday. Many of the migrants who were arrested along the sea route were not from Syria, officials said, citing the UNHCR's recent decision to put down the issue of safe zones in Libya, which it says has become "a haven for smugglers." The migrants detained in Mytilene "will now be repatriated to Greece," Frontex said in a news release. There are around 1,600 people still waiting to be turned back to Libya. Greek coastguards, in accordance with the country's protocol, have been deploying ships in the Aegean Sea for more than a month to search for migrants stranded there. The Greek coastguard's vessels rescued 17 migrants from the sea route in January alone, while the Aegean also saw five attempts to reach Crete. On Tuesday, the head of the international Organization for Migration, Jose Manuel Barroso, said that the EU will allow Greece and Turkey to take 1,000 migrants off board so that more can land on Greek islands. According to the International Organization for Migration's latest figures, Greece is the third most likely destination for migrants heading to Europe. Another 7,500 people had sought and accepted refuge in Europe by November 9, down from 12,700 the previous week, as the world's attention turned toward migrant and refugee crises in countries across the Mediterranean, with Italy reporting that more migrants arrived on its northern shores on Tuesday alone. In late September, more than 1,100 African migrants were abandoned and abandoned by their traffickers after coming across the Aegean after crossing back to Greece, according to UN figures. However, most of them came to Greek islands. Many Greek officials, including those in charge of dealing with the migrants, said, however, that they were concerned by their ability to deal with the issue of asylum seekers.
