 media and in newspapers across the UK as a major embarrassment for Ms May. Mr Turner said that he had been referring to her attempts to reduce the value of the pound during her first cabinet meeting as the government's Brexit transition team, according to a BBC report. He was quoted as saying: "We are going to go very far in our exit negotiations by reducing the value of all the currencies in the world." A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: "The British government is committed to staying in the EU and wants to maintain an open, free and orderly trade relationship with Europe." But Brexit was still a major issue at Sunday's Conservative Party conference. Baroness Williams, the shadow home secretary, said Ms May's plan to cap the value of Brexit-related assets was "a disastrous idea with grave implications". She said: "No-one is going to be worse off, no one." Labour's Emily Thornberry described this as "outrageous" and said there would be a "fundamental economic problem", while the Tory MP Diane Abbott said: "Brexit is one of the greatest risks we might face for decades to come, and Theresa May is wrong to think the pound can be spared in this process." Nick Timothy, the MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, claimed that the announcement would encourage investors to pile into sterling because of "the price impact it could have across the economy". He said: "This is a disastrous announcement and one that can only hurt the economy." He told BBC Breakfast that "withholding from the pound means banks and other non-emergency payments would be frozen". Ms May's comments came after her Conservative party's Brexit spokesman made a series of high profile statements about the EU, including that Ms May is convinced Britain will fail to win the divorce negotiations.
