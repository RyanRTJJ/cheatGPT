 the driver, her two children and the father-of-the-bride.

The two were pronounced dead at the scene shortly afterwards. Two injured patients were taken to hospital where their condition is described as serious. A third victim was pronounced dead at the scene, gardai confirmed. A man and a woman, aged in their forties, had been taken to Beaumont Hospital in a serious condition. Another man, also aged in his forties, was treated for a suspected broken leg at Tallaght Hospital.

Earlier on Saturday morning, gardai had closed down the road which is close to the Dublin Airport, and they resumed their work around the scene around noon. Gardai asked people not to approach the scene, but instead to contact local Garda stations.

“The family and Gardaí are shocked and are being supported by gardaí,” a garda spokesman said, adding, “We are carrying out a number of investigations as our inquiries continue.”

A spokeswoman for HSE East Region said two ambulances, a rapid response vehicle and a number of healthcare colleagues attended the scene shortly after 10am and made the two patients a priority. The victims were treated at the scene by the HSE ambulance team.

They were met outside the grounds by paramedics, who were taken to both the Mater Hospital and Temple Street Children’s Hospital in Dublin for treatment. A female family member suffered a suspected broken leg. The cause of the crash remains under investigation.

A spokeswoman for the Irish Nurses & Midwives Organisation condemned the road crash, calling for safer routes to travel and for more road signs to be installed.

“There is nothing more important that we can do, in light of current road safety concerns, than ensure safer routes are built and signposted and that the most vulnerable road users are protected from harm,” the spokeswoman added.
