Facebook said the service is only available in select cities.

While Facebook doesn't officially sell the privacy policy, its founders have said they don't have any intention to share it publicly.

That hasn't stopped Internet privacy groups, which want similar plans, from raising money behind them. Last month, a group called Open Technology Institute raised more than $2 million directly from investors after it announced plans to get a law passed to require Facebook to unlock its database in order to gain access.

In its latest round of funding, the Open Technology Institute said it is considering raising $20 million to "build a new open source community" that would help Facebook develop more consumer-friendly options for its users.

The privacy debate is still in its early stages, said Open Technology Institute president Rick Falkvinge. The group's goal, he said, is to help Facebook "get the technical capabilities right, build the community which would help that happen."

Privacy advocates and tech companies continue to fight.

In July, the U.S. government ordered Facebook to turn data in more than 60 million of its users' contacts between its own users. The government alleged that Facebook has "misused" the personal information for advertising or selling it or selling it to other Facebook users. Facebook has repeatedly said it has a policy against sharing users' contact records.

If he did decide to vote for president, Zuckerberg may feel more obligated than most people have to take issue with the government's proposals.

With his wealth, privacy fears, and popularity, Zuckerberg would be well placed to know that his views are at odds with popular opinion on issues of
