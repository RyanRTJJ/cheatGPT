 China's cyber espionage operation was at the heart of a recent US Senate report on China's military.

After the hacking in mid-December, a senior US official said it was believed "at least 10 cyber espionage actors" were working from China's Xinjiang region to steal details about US military equipment.

President Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning that he has spoken to his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and congratulated him on his re-election victory, adding that "I greatly appreciate your tough efforts to protect the lives of the American people." Xi, who has been in China for more than a month, had already been planning to visit Washington before the latest incidents in the United States.

Speaking at the White House later on Wednesday, Trump said he was disappointed by the recent attacks and the US retaliation. But he also told Xi he had done a "good job" and hoped the US could resume "the very strong relationship we have always had."

This has been a busy week. Just over a month after he left office, President Trump sat down with Xi at a G20 summit in China. As part of that trip, Trump was due to go to the Singapore summit with North Korea and, later on Wednesday, held a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump's first major meeting with a foreign leader on his first trip since he took executive action on immigration last year was with Putin, but his meeting with Xi might have been more revealing.

The two men met one hour before Trump's meeting with the president of another Chinese-American businessman and his son, whose business has been a major focus of US government investment in China as part of its efforts to open up the nation's financial markets.

Xi's trip to the United States is likely to have been overshadowed by reports that China has launched sweeping cyberattacks on American businesses and institutions in retaliation for Trump's decision to impose tariffs on $34
