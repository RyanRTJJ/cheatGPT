 unchanged from the day of the original experiments in 1640, in what was the earliest known case of what is now known as a placebo effect.

In fact, they found that the actual effect was almost exactly the same as placebo treatment. They conclude from their research with the "discoveries in medicine and science" of the 1700s to present day that even "simple herbal remedies should not be ignored".

How to prevent the placebo effect

In order to counter the placebo effect, one should, as a first line of attack, try to isolate the real causal factor in any experimental variable. There will always be cases where placebo effects are real and some or all of these events are the result of some kind of real interaction. In this regard, the placebo effect has become a bit of a 'black box' which is why it is so difficult to pinpoint exactly what causes it.

However, to avoid the placebo effect in your practice there are some simple things you can do.

Make sure your training is properly controlled

Any training program with heavy weights or repetitive action should be monitored and balanced in order to prevent any unintended negative side-effects.

Get regular feedback in order to make a distinction between training and fatigue and develop healthy eating habits

While I know that this is an important idea, most of us simply don't eat regularly. What is important for the performance of the exercises you are undertaking cannot be quantified in a spreadsheet and a pre-workout shake because there are simply too many variables involved to be able to do a proper analysis.

Avoid using heavy weights on your legs and butt

The effect of using heavy weights on legs and butt is much more easily measurable in the exercise itself. A well-controlled, controlled exercise program like Squat Workout works better than a heavy load variation, especially one that is not properly balanced.

Train light weights with a wide grip for muscle development

Many people don't realise the benefits of light weights on the lower
