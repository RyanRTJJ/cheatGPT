 that he came down with influenza and spent three days confined to a room and bed.


He said the patient was an autistic boy, aged three or four, with limited mobility.

The man had been there for four days. He had been in constant fear of being taken away by ambulance but this did not happen.

He said he was kept in solitary confinement for five months, but eventually managed to escape when he was about 12. The man remained there, with some help, three years after the event.

He has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar illness and alcohol psychosis, and has suffered from depression, memory loss and behavioural delay. He has received treatment at the same site at the Hospital of the North Oxford, with assistance from a team of people who provide free mental health care.

He described himself as being lucky to be alive.

He told me: "I have been in solitary confinement for three solid years. It is the biggest horror story I ever have.

"The guards always say the main problem is people don't want to talk. And for me, what I thought from the beginning was that it would only get worse because now I was not around. We got some treatment in the hospital which is much better than I was doing.

"There was no room at St Francis any more. It was very hard because nobody helped me and I was alone. I just had nothing to cling onto."

His mother, Diane, said she is suffering with depression and fears of losing out on the care of her autistic son, although she believes the case is "much tougher". "He has my child's best interests at heart, as we always say," she told me. "But it doesn't leave you feeling any better afterwards."

I asked him about the experience. "It is hard," he said. "Sometimes you lose belief in whatever is around."

If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. I hope that we have a better understanding
