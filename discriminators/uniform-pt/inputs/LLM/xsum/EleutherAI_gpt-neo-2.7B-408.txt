ia Dugdale said she had no problem with the group, adding it was doing its best.

A Scottish Labour spokesperson said it would support either coalition with the Tories or independence depending on the wishes of the voters.

Meanwhile, Ian Blackford, editor of the Scottish Daily Record, called on the group to hold a referendum on independence if they were to become a new party.

He told the press, which is backing the party, which voted in favour of the referendum on devo max, in February.

The Scottish National party says it does not support the decision.

Mr Blackford said people's views had changed on the campaign by a "thousand miles" and he called on Labour to stand for the "democratic choice" on Scottish issues.

The editor said he agreed with the arguments of the SNP on Scotland's currency and fiscal issues, but disagreed on the "constitutional integrity" or the "legally binding nature of the treaties" which will govern the currency.

In other news, Scottish Labour also said they plan to go into the EU to lobby for Scottish independence.

Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said the group would lobby ministers over Brexit, telling STV's Sunday Politics Scotland a key part of their plan is to travel to Brussels, London and Brussels again.

Meanwhile, former leader of Scottish Labour John Swinney said voters would want to know why the party did not support independence this time round.

He told STV: "The voters were not prepared to let the Scottish Labour Party become a vehicle for a minority administration of this country.

"In this referendum it was not a good deal and it was not a good outcome for Scotland - it was an absolute disaster.

"A disaster is a matter of public perception. I am not here to defend the failure of our electoral system."

Mr Swinney added Labour lost the referendum because the "Labour right wing had got it"
