 for us to get better at everything, it's going to be tough. We have to be better. We need to be quicker and strong again.

"The second part of it is going get better. The second half I think it's really about us playing like we can play every day. This will certainly make the difference. They won't go to the back three, we are not going to play to the back three, we got to play off of them and we are going to do that."

Rangers beat Racing 92 for what were Glasgow's biggest win in Glasgow in their history

The first five minutes were lively and the Lions kept pressing and the break was not long enough for Glasgow's players to find their bearings and hold on to their lead.

Their attack was slow and the Lions were forced off the mark. Jamie Vardy beat Danny Drinkwater on penalties as the game had an odd length to it but a foul was called. James Taverner scored the only goal for Rangers, before Patrick O'Driscoll turned their ball over the bar as they held.

When the first goal by Drinkwater went out and Rangers dominated on a breakaway to make the first-half draw that night, the fact that Glasgow were so far behind by 20 points seemed all too obvious. With more shots blocked and more time for the defence to catch hold of the ball and hold on, Glasgow kept it together.

Rangers continued to push forward with an unstoppable display in the second half, having a great chance but were denied by two fouls to the head of Glasgow defenders.

Tory forward Chris Boyd picked out Drinkwater after the interval while Toni Krahler was on target in the final 30 yards but Rangers came back with a second, the winger finishing with a brace to make it 3-0.
