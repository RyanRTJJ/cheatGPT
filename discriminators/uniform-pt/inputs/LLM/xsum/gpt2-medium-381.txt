: "With the help of a helicopter, they've been able to get inside the island and make contact with people who were there. "By coming here, they've got our word that they are going back out to sea."

"We did everything possible to get people through."

The Llanbedr Airfield is well known for its naval installations such as HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Tirees - but the Llanbedr Island, which sits just west of the airfield, is the next closest.

Campsite manager Richard Workman told the Press Association: "We did everything possible to get people through. They're going back out to sea so they have two, three hours sleep and can come back in the morning, at best."

Worst-affected

There are three main campsites for the three campsite users inside the Llanbedr Island - Shell Island, St Mary's Bay in Swansea and the mainland.

They are all currently accessible to the public by charter boat out to sea, boat ride and a trip to a mainland resort, although campers can also stay overnight at the nearby Llanbedr Resort.

No matter how well-managed their sites, they and their residents will most likely come under fire.

"When things go badly, they'll think there's nowhere to go and that's why some people do not want to camp here," Workman said.

"What we cannot be sure of is that it is even safe to stay here in case you get wind of the fire.

"We've heard that there were fires around the camp site at the time of the explosion last year. If they think they have to leave now, they'll get frightened and it won't be fair to them."

No one has been killed due to the fire so far, according to authorities.
