 on his relationship with the club and also work with assistant manager John Barnes – Jenkins says he has done enough in his two years at the club. “This club is a special club. There is no doubt about that,” he says. “The difference in quality between this club and what we had just a few years ago is just remarkable. We have great supporters. We are in a position to play Champions League football.” However, with the club currently facing a four-point deduction due to the ‘financial irregularities’ which has seen them fined in excess of £70m, Jenkins’ position at the club – now he is an automatic member.

However, he wants to “leave it in the hands of the directors”. It is believed in the short term, when the club has the money to survive, Guidolin will stay on as head
