Borough is in the Newham area.

"We're not sure how these people were allowed to get in there," said a source.

Borough is also the former home of the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, who hanged himself in his apartment there in January after he killed himself while filming the film The Hunger Games on the set.

The actors, believed to be US actors in their 40s from the US, had been told to wait and were later escorted outside from their cars.

The incident happened on Friday night. As with all shootings, no-one was hurt except for the two police officers who were responding to the call.

A police spokesman said there was "no evidence to suggest that any other individuals have been injured".

The source said there were no further incidents or arrests.

"An officer was hurt," the source said. "He came out of the building with glass in his face."

The shooting follows a slew of police shootings of black men over the past couple of months across the US.

In the last 24 hours, there have been a number of shootings of black men on the streets of Tulsa, Oklahoma, an incident at a gas station in Florida, and a shooting of two black men in a car in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on August 7.

The NYPD and Mayor Bill de Blasio condemned the "appalling" shooting.

"I join my fellow New York Cityers in praying for the speedy recovery of our police officers who were on duty protecting the public and the homecoming celebration that evening. Such acts of violence are not tolerated."
