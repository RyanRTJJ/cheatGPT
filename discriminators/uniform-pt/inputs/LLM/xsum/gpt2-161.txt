 showing his hand in a picture of a "white woman who is a slave to the black man."

"The black girl — I have a white woman and I have a white master," he said while taking a photograph of the man before taking the picture. "All in all, my own opinion… I would never have considered something like that."

As for the slave owners who built mansions in the North, the artist who took the picture is taking shots of the black slave owners, who are seen in his portrait as little children, with their white and African-American counterparts facing down a new slave, his hand on their hips.

According to the New York News, the scene was "watched all over the town," but the local NAACP, which is involved in both protest and violence, has said it will hold its first protest this weekend against the new master. A vigil is set for Saturday from 4 to 6 p.m. at the Jefferson Parish Library.

The photographer who pulled the photo is credited with "trying to capture the moment" of white women in slave-gaining, white-owned white mansions that are built using slavery-era white techniques and "couples slaves, masters and slaves, and white people who used the most despicable tactics to create a situation where we have no rights," the story notes.

A few days later, a series of black male slaves with the intent of making white women enslaved, like the one in the photo, was seen as white men standing in front of white women.

The photo was snapped by the owner of a South Carolina mansion for the New York Public Library, Richard Cisneros, who also has a museum on the plantation. Cisneros described the photo as "pretty incredible," adding, "I'm talking about the people who built their mansions on these very white property as well for such a short time."
