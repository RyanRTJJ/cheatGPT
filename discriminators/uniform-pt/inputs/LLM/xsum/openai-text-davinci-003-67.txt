ega CEO Ernst Kohler said: "We can confirm that there were attempts to fraudulently acquire sensitive medical data of Michael Schumacher from the Rega base in Cambridge. We take privacy and data security of our patients very seriously and have robust measures in place to guard against such attempts. We have asked the Swiss prosecutor to investigate this case and hope that all those involved can soon be identified and brought to justice."

Kohler added: "We are grateful that, to the best of our knowledge, no medical data has been compromised. Our staff were not involved in any way in this attack and we have full confidence in their integrity."
