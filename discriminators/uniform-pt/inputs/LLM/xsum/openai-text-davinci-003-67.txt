s taking the action

to challenge the recommendations of a Consultative Group issued in January 2019 to take forward the legacy of the conflict.

They are asking for leave for a judicial review of amendments made to the Stormont House agreement by the British government, arguing that the changes from the original agreement were legally flawed.

The group believes that the changes exclude victims of state violence and those injured by non-state actors from having meaningful access to the truth. They are also challenging the lack of independently monitored investigations and the failure to provide a new financial package to enable victims to access the services they need and deserve.

The judicial review application is for leave to apply for a judicial review as to whether the government has acted unlawfully through its decision to make the changes. In particular, the challenge is concerned with whether the government acted unlawfully in acting without a basis in law, by acting in a procedurally unfair way, and whether the changes breached the rights of victims under Articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

If successful, the review would also consider whether the government acted unlawfully in taking out of context recommendations made by the Consultative Group, thereby overreaching and bypassing the legitimate consultation process to which it had previously agreed. In other words, the action is seeking to hold the British Government to account to its legal obligations and to correct what is perceived as a fundamental departure from the original terms and conditions of the Stormont House agreement.
