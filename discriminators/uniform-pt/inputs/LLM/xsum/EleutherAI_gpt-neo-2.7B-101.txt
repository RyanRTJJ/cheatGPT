 just 14 thanks to Glenn Turner, Graham Napier and Jeff Hammond who played some exquisite bowling during Essex's only half-decent innings.

Chelmsford could not chase as well and eventually had to score just nine to win.

The next afternoon was Essex's most successful performance and they beat the visiting Lancashire champions by eight wickets, Donald scoring 50 and Napier taking 6-49.

Skipper Johnson, the county's best batsman, scored 68 before he was caught by James Foster off Jeff Stollmeyer.

The county's hopes got a huge boost when Turner returned with another century and then Napier played some sublime shots that drew a fourth-wicket stand of 157 to leave Essex needing eight runs for victory.

There seemed no way for Chelsford to chase victory, though, and they ended the day on 145-7.

The final day began well for Chelmsford, but they only scored a couple more before a rain ceasefire ended proceedings at 7.45pm. A total of just five runs was required and it was Chelsford that had the upper hand as they made 114-9 in their second innings.

But Essex bowled even better that afternoon and took the visitors to only 10-2 before Turner struck the decisive blow, picking up four wickets for just 36 runs.

Donald had top-scored with 45 and Napier was the more reliable performer with 14 wickets and a superb match figures of 14-41.

Eton Road was Essex's home ground for most of the season and they did their best work there, scoring 50 in the first innings and then 75 in the second.

The rain held up play in the first and second innings leaving the visitors to score just 26 and 32.

Then, though, a glorious breakthrough saw Essex win by nine wickets with Turner taking 6-39.

Chelmsford had little to offer the visitors and they finished with 12-7
