e Welsh Government Final Budget has been approved.

The core duties of WRA are to collect and manage the tax revenues of Wales. It will also provide customer services to Welsh taxpayers, produce guidance and support for Welsh taxpayers, and manage the compliance of Welsh taxpayers with their requirements.

The WRA will be supported by three main teams; Technical & Policy, Customer Services and Operations. 

Technical & Policy – This team will be responsible for assessing and recommending the taxes, rates and reliefs to be introduced in Wales. It will also be responsible for providing policy analysis and guidance on legislative matters, and dealing with customer queries around the Welsh tax system. 

Customer Services – This team will be responsible for providing advice and assistance to Welsh taxpayers. They will also be responsible for delivering effective customer service, including processing refunds and payment requests.

Operations – This team will be responsible for overall compliance of the Welsh taxpayer so that the WRA can achieve its core duty of collecting and managing the Welsh revenues. It will also be responsible for the enforcement, investigation, and audit activities undertaken by the WRA. 

In undertaking its duties, the WRA will be subject to the same rigour, transparency and accountability expected of any Government body. It will be accountable to the Welsh Government, which will provide overall oversight and direction, and to the National Assembly for Wales for its operations, performance and budget.
