 unable to explain it.

Rosberg said after practice that the team's problems were down to a lack of focus.

"It's not been a lot of a focused effort to understand what the problems are," he said. "It's really difficult to say what is wrong. It was a very simple weekend."

Williams driver Felipe Massa believes a failure to gain track position in the first race, and not the qualifying performance of Lewis Hamilton, was to blame for the Mercedes domination.

"The reason we lose out is because we're not fast enough there," he said. "It was very simple.

"The first race was a failure to put in all the work to gain the track position we didn't have early on. It was our fault in the first race."

It came as a result of a lack of experience in the final sector in front of the pit wall when the car hits the wall, as Williams used a two-stop strategy and did not know it was possible to have a third stop.

Massa added: "'It's easier said than done. We're not going to stop in the middle of a corner. So let's wait, let's wait, let's wait and then in the last sector maybe they will come out, maybe they won't."

The new qualifying system introduced for the season also meant that drivers needed a perfect, unbroken race to qualify.

"The grid positions were just not in the right order, the grid is very complicated in Hungary and this is my first weekend there," said Massa.

"And then a lot of the points come from the race position, so for sure there are mistakes but for sure it's a difficult weekend."

Vettel won in Hungary earlier this year

Mercedes' new partner Toyota's Nico Hulkenberg said the new qualifying format for the Hungaroring had left the team with "very positive" impressions after three days in Hungary.

"The pace is very good," he added. "The car feels strong. They are doing a lot of work.

"It's been quite a short time, but I think so far we are quite satisfied."
