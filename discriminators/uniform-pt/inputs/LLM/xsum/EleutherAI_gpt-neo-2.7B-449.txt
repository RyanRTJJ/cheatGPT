 optional class for students who are willing to pay from free to Â£100 as well as give course credit for students who register for the free version.

What exactly is this course?

The course is run in Oxford and involves reading and writing in Greek. The book is written by a single author, who is usually referred to only by a first name, so even if you complete the course, you can't necessarily know who wrote the book. The writing is pretty simple- and even the most ardent scholar should be able to do it. This has a great advantage: the syllabus is published and there is always someone around who can help you if anything doesn't sound right. There are no quizzes or other forms of assessment, so there is no pressure to do each class, no right and wrong answers, and no points systems. The course only has you cover material in the course book and only if you do all the reading and write down everything you read. One thing that it does do is create an online culture of writing and publishing Greek. There is a blog on the course that contains essays and a series of articles that you can read about how people have published from the course. This is more a part of the course culture than a core part.

We will soon post a couple of open enrolment dates in June and Sept. It seems to be the only course outside Oxford that has more than 1,000 people studying the Greek.

Why do it?

There is no one answer that makes anyone happier. Personally, I think all of this is for the greater good of those students who are willing to pay a bit more. The course seems to be popular among people who have little Greek fluency and want a high-level introduction. It is also free for students who are paying for a course at other universities, though you may receive course credit towards your next course fee. While the course is free, the materials will be expensive because this is Oxford's Mooc.
