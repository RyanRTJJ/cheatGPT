Some 42% of UK households have a holiday home overseas, new research shows.

The survey was carried out by the UK Housing Survey in 2014 for Land Registry, which is developing a national database of home ownership and ownership transactions across the UK.

A total of 8.5 million UK homes are now owned by individuals and households who have no registered owner, up by 0.3% since 2013.

The survey of 10,000 households in 2014/15, which found only 12% having a holiday home, found 15% of UK households would look to buy overseas, up from 16% the previous year.

The research found that more than half (61%) of new homeowners would look to buy overseas, the highest share since the research started in 2004/05. The number who said they had bought a holiday home to live in fell to 19% from 21% and those who wanted to purchase a home in the near future fell to 40% from 43%.

Those wishing to buy overseas were more likely to be in their 40s, while those looking domestically were much younger.

“The overall trend which we observed was for more of us in the UK to own our own home and a good proportion of that was overseas,” said Matt Hewitt, the director for housing economics at Land Registry.

“The rate of overseas buyers was driven by an expansion of the number of foreign owners who bought their own home, whereas domestic house-hunting was driven by a small proportion of homeowners in their 40s in part looking for a second home.

“Homeowners in their 40s were also more likely to have purchased abroad to live rather than as a holiday home, compared with owners who were already retired,” he added.

Income is another factor that influences the amount of a household’s income which it can spend on overseas buying property, it is suggested.

The survey found that 39% of UK households who did not own a holiday home spent all or part of the yearly income for that year on buying it.
