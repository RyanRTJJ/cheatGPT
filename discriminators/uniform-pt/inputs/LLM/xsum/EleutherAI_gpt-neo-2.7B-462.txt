The company said one worker was suffering from pneumoconiosis. In 2006, a lawyer for a widow who took her ex-husband's case against Samsung said: "This is really a corporate poison."

It was a busy month for the South Korean firm, which said on Tuesday that Samsung Television America's cable network had completed a live TV broadcast in the US.

The group is known as MBC, a subsidiary of the South Korean conglomerate, Samsung Group.

Analysts have said Samsung has been increasingly aggressive in its attempts to make its brands known. Last year it reported an increase in profits of 40% and a further boost of 24% in profit for 2015 as the effect of an earlier corporate restructuring had seen a substantial increase in earnings from operating activities.

"Samsung is known for its aggressive advertising and promotion in Asia and the Far East, but in this case, it has taken a new and unique approach that is designed to directly and visually connect Samsung with American consumers who are looking for a positive brand experience," said Matthew Oltmanns, analyst at Ovum.
