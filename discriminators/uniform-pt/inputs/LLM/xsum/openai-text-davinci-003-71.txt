 deadly night shifts, while workers of both sexes should try to maintain normal sleeping patterns.

The report is based on a study of 194 women living in France and Sweden. The scientists monitored lifestyle factors such as exercise and smoking, as well as the amount of time spent working night shifts. They found women who regularly worked three or more night shifts per month over a 10-year period had significantly higher breast cancer risk than those who never worked nights.

The study also suggested that night workers who involve in particular chemical-intensive industries, such as chemical plants and oil refineries, may be particularly susceptible to the risk.

While further studies are needed to confirm these findings, the authors of the report suggest employers should provide support for night workers and make sure that adequate health and safety measures are in place. Employers should also encourage appropriate napping time and other activities that can help combat fatigue, they said.

With the prevalence of shift work increasing, the report also comes at a time when scientists are warning of a need for greater public awareness of the health risks of night-shift work.

“Given the health implications, it is important to understand the risks associated with shift work and take measures to mitigate these where possible,” lead researcher Sophie Triche said. “We hope our findings will contribute to the development of improved workplace policies for shift workers.”
