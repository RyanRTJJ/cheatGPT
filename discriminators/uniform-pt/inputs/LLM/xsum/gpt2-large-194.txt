 now called the St Nicholas Estate - to be complete and habitable within 4½ years or so.

St Paul's House, The St Paul's Museum, and other key buildings would not be demolished, only the façade and contents of St Paul's Church and the grounds would be altered. The rehouse is a new, residential community on the site, designed as a co-working space/hackerspace.

"The St Paul's House community will play a major role in creating the space for the St Nicholas Estate to be developed and live on," says Ben.

The scheme has received wide support from local and national policy makers including London Mayor Boris Johnson, and City University's Design Research Centre, on its ability 'to foster creative, urban and sustainable learning environments'.

The St Nicholas community was established by the Mayor of London as a non-profit charitable organisation with the aim to provide sustainable and innovative learning environments for adults, youth, young people and students.

"We're pleased that this innovative scheme, which is being carried out by the UK's largest private sector architecture company in the UK, has been chosen for the redevelopment," says Ben, who has been working on this "very different" project for almost 4 years.

Stonston House will be built near the existing St Paul's House, with a proposal for a new community housing development.

With over a million residents and thousands of visitors each year, the St Paul's Chapel area of Southwark is home to historic buildings that are not up to scratch and, more importantly to local residents, have not received proper maintenance and attention over decades.

The scheme aims to regenerate St Paul's and the surrounding streets, and provide a place where local people can easily access affordable housing, and where those who work in the area can better access the area and its nearby amenities.

The community will be designed as a co-working platform, with support from the local Chamber of Commerce.
