 right" to know who ministers were profiting from taxpayers' money.

Lord Foulkes warned in December that senior officials were working in "the most extraordinary way" to protect their own interests and that "a state of permanent conflict" had developed in Downing Street that affected government decision-making.

Lord Foulkes said: "The key fact to emerge from all these revelations is the extent of corruption and misconduct at the heart of the New Labour government. It is a scandal that the Blair government has lost the trust of the British people.

"The Tories have failed to provide them with the strong and stable leadership demanded."

But the Prime Minister said the allegations were "fantasy and fiction".

He described the Labour peer - and one-time government minister - as a "dissident with an axe to grind."

Lord Foulkes' allegations stem from a meeting on 7 December with officials, including the Cabinet Secretary Lord Falconeria, when he was asked about a list of ministers' personal investment properties. There is no suggestion senior officials acted improperly at the meeting.

But at his inquiry into the MPs' expenses scandal, the House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee heard that Lord Foulkes then sent a memo to officials, including the Cabinet Secretary, about three pages long.

Lord Foulkes claimed he sent the note and memo after "staging a personal protest" over the incident.

On Friday the Cabinet Secretary told the Commons that "in the light of the inquiry in the Lords, the Cabinet Secretary had made a decision to have the Cabinet Secretary's independent and experienced officers carry out further inquiries into the matters raised".

Mr Falconeria has now told a committee of MPs that "there is no evidence that any such memo was sent". He has described the claims as "preposterous", adding: "It is not clear what Lord Foulkes' motive was."

In a statement, Mr Falconeria said: "I have conducted a thorough investigation into the matter, which confirms that no classified memo or other document of any kind was sent, or was intended to be sent."

The Cabinet Secretary said Lord Foulkes "repeatedly tried to interfere" in the Cabinet Secretary's role,
