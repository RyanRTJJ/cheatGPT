 all their pool games, face Fiji in Tuesday's bronze medal match.

There were mixed emotions among Canada's players, as only two players were in both the 2011 Rugby World Cup and the 2014 campaign.

"Our guys have played really well over the last two weeks," head coach Kingsley Jones said. "As a team we just didn't quite get over the line this time. I've spoken to a number of our players afterwards and congratulated Fiji on their achievement.

"I have absolutely no complaints with the way the team have performed for the last two weeks.

"I know the players and coaches feel extremely hard done-by after not being selected for the World Cup."

Canada's semi-final defeat by Fiji was the third time they failed to reach the final of a major multi-nations tournament.

They will meet the Fijian side in the final for the first time since 2007.
