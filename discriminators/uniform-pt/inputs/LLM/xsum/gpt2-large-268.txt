 the BBC's Sunday Politics programme.

In her interview in the Daily Telegraph, she said her party's position on RHI – which offers lower rates than the government's subsidy for green energy – was clear.

She said: "I'm absolutely clear we are against the subsidy, and there will be no RHI again in Northern Ireland in the next 20 years.

"The key thing is that it is totally wrong for the money we are providing to be spent on the heat rather than on the poor to benefit the poor.

"We are completely opposed to the subsidy. Why make any contribution at all to the heating of the country when you are going to have an absolute free market?

"So it needs to be made clear that there will be absolutely no RHI in the North in the next 20 years."

The DUP says it would support any government plan to change the tax status of green energy. But it has been accused of acting as a mouthpiece for the UK Government.

Green MEPs say the party should get its spending out of the RHI debate and focus on other issues, such as fighting climate change, education and skills.

The DUP's economic strategy is based on the assumption the UK Government will give Northern Ireland a free pass to pursue its own interests, including on economic matters.

The party has taken the extraordinary step of taking a pledge that it will vote against the Tories in the forthcoming Budget if they do not scrap the fuel duty threshold.

The MP for Lisburn was not asked by the Sunday Politics programme if she had changed her mind.

"I am quite happy to be asked what is my position on a number of issue but not on RHI," she said.

A spokesman said: "Like all parties in the devolved administrations, Northern Ireland was elected following a fair majority in favour of its independence.
