 that Cuba said will end the war once and for all.

President Barack Obama acknowledged that Washington's relationship with Cuba was strained in the past, but he said the U.S. would keep its distance, saying Washington would continue diplomatic pressure.

"Since the end of the Cold War, Washington and Havana have enjoyed a cooperative relationship, and we see a path to normalcy that is both mutually beneficial," he said.

The presidents will hold a joint news conference for the second time, the first being in November 2015, in a trip that will feature the American president.

The meeting is seen as part of a U.S. effort to show the world that Washington still stands behind its new, liberal, liberal Cuban economy, as well as support the nation's rights. In December 2010, Obama visited Havana with other world leaders and brokered the Cuban-American agreement with Obama that gave the island its independence in 1959.

During their talks Cuban leader Raul Castro described U.S. policies as "rude, aggressive and hostile" but said they should be changed "as soon as we can."

The president-Cuban spokesman later said some aspects of the U.S. embargo were being relaxed, though it was not officially done, while others were still illegal.

It was not clear if a more detailed statement from Obama planned ahead of the signing took the shape of an opening letter, the White House said.

In an apparent dig at President Donald Trump, Cuban state media have repeated the message that the two sides reached accord, and in recent days, anti-U.S. Cubans in the capital have taken to street demonstrations.
