 trading system before they are offered jobs.

But the move is likely to complicate an already complex issue, as the Whitehall department of culture, media and sport (CMS) is set to have an additional 10 people in the top job on March 1st, alongside seven senior officials from the foreign office and the economy ministry, according to insiders.

The new structure would include:

•A senior civil servant in both Whitehall and the foreign office, who would oversee Brexit negotiations

•A civil servant in the Treasury

•A senior economic adviser in the Office for Budget Responsibility

•An adviser to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in the Foreign Office and a foreign affairs consultant (not just for the Treasury)

•A special adviser working with the Department for Business to help shape a position

•A senior adviser to the Chancellor

A ministerial spokesman said: "This new arrangement is the outcome of two years of detailed work and negotiations by both sides on policy which has led to a position that we can announce today. This is the first step in our plan to ensure that we provide a level playing field across the sector as we work to secure UK business for British trade."

The department, which is being spun off from departments including trade, the Treasury and foreign affairs, has promised to ensure that staff working on the policy of withdrawal are given an equal education.

It follows an offer from the EU to compensate UK officials working on the Brexit programme who may find themselves out of work or leave the country, in return for their knowledge of the EU-based global business and trade system. Negotiations are understood to have been going on over the past year for about 100 staffers for the post of special adviser to the Chancellor.
