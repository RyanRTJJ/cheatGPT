Students must register online between May 2 and May 12 and will get in touch with an Oxford marketing chief, David Clark, and a professor. A MOOC team and other external funding will provide resources and help set the schedule.

To be eligible to take the online course, a student must be at least 18 years of age and a member of a UK university. It will be broadcast by YouTube, YouTube Learning, the BBC, YouTube, Redtube, Udacity.

David Clark, co-founder of the Oxford Internet Institute, said: "Like many universities, Oxford believes that this type of technology will help us learn more. This is a hugely significant moment in the evolution of Oxford's digital learning project and also in the wider world of online learning. We want to give students a chance to learn more, while ensuring that their learning is authentic."

The project will make online course materials available from universities around the UK with the aim of ensuring they have the highest standards and offering best-in-class access to them.

The online course is the world's first complete course around the history of the Internet â€“ one that students can view online (or watch on BBC iPlayer) and a video version will be available on BBC iPlayer, Redtube and YouTube shortly.

Dr Tom Taylor, a course co-author who worked with Clark on the history of the web, said: "The launch of Oxford's first ever professional MOOC is a fantastic launch of an important new development in online education and a major leap forward for this area as the technology and skills that are making our world possible grow ever more accessible.

"The MOOC is sure to transform the way that academics think, learn and research around the world, and, importantly, it provides an opportunity for universities, industry and those who take courses to explore more deeply the history of the internet. The online course team is eager to see this take off in a timely and impactful way, and it's great to be able to share the opportunity and lead this project together."
