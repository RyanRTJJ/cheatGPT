Police believe he was high on drugs, and did not drive according to Highway Traffic Act specifications, but it is still an impaired driving investigation.

The man and woman were in their 50s and they lived together. The woman worked night shifts for her father at the hospital but lived alone on the main floor of a detached six-storey house on Dartmouth Road, at approximately 1 a.m. on Sunday.

The officer believed the woman appeared to be under the influence of drugs and did not have the presence of mind to provide a breath sample to a police officer.

After the officers left she died in the care of a family friend.
