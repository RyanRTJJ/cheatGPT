 "It's about time the police start to show some guts" and the victims' families, friends, work colleagues and general community began asking questions.

"It's all very tragic and there have been some ugly crimes committed," Lockyer said, referring to domestic abuse. The first victim, 28-year-old Lisa-Jayne Armstrong, died in Cairns on Monday night, as did an unidentified woman who was stabbed at a party near Rockhampton on Thursday. A third woman, aged between 35 and 40 years and named by police only as Ms W, died at a private hospital on Wednesday.

The three killings left the state reeling and prompted renewed calls to introduce mandatory arrest powers, allow police to be armed inside homes and create a national database of domestic violence offenders.

On Thursday, Lockyer said the police response had not come up to scratch.

"If the police can't do their job, in the case of the one in Rockhampton, and the one, the deceased was arrested for assault," he said, "if they can't do that to help a victim of domestic violence, the rest of the laws in this state are a joke."

On Thursday, Lockyer pointed out that in NSW, the death penalty had not been used for murder since 1990.

"My suggestion is the Queensland Government create an independent domestic violence inquiry," he said. "That's the first course of action. If that doesn't work, then get the death penalty brought in so it can be at least a deterrent."

On Thursday, the Queensland premier, Peter Beattie, said he "fully and unequivocally", agreed with Lockyer. However, the premier said he was unsure where the death penalty might come from.

"The premier is aware that the death penalty has been abolished in NSW and the NSW law does not allow for an alternative," a spokesperson for Beattie said. "Queensland does not have a law enabling the death penalty."

However, the Queensland parliament recently voted that the State be allowed to legislate for the death penalty, a spokesman for Beattie said, and this had not changed.

If the death penalty is not an option, Lockyer said he was proposing the creation of
