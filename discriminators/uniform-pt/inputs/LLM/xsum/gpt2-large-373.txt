 26, on her way to her fourth World Championship gold in nine years.

The 28-year-old McColgan also finished fourth in the women's 10,000m at the Rio Olympics, and fourth in the women's 100m hurdles at the 2012 Paralympic Games.

McColgan, who has two wins in four meets in her career, is confident that she can defend her crown if she maintains her pace.

"That's the ultimate goal if you're a sprinter â€“ to defend a spot on the podium every year," she said. "I certainly have the opportunity to do that. I'll stay the course. I still think that's my game plan every year: try to go in and do what I do best. I'll be pretty confident in doing that."

Her third-place Olympic finish at the London 2012 Games gives us hope that McColgan will have a strong 2017 campaign, despite having had to cancel her planned appearance at the London Olympics after the virus spread through the Olympic village.

She also had to cancel her planned retirement after suffering a torn hamstring in the Commonwealth Games.

Even with the Olympics cancelled, McColgan had a great show at the USA Track & Field Trials last week. She ran in the 11,000m, 10,000m and 10m hurdles and finished sixth in the latter event.

"It's great to be back at a good meet like the Trials," she said. "I think it was just a combination of a full-blown sickness, so we were out of that. It just happened to be me.

"I'm definitely excited, but the hardest thing was coming home and trying to get ready for the trials, because it's very stressful on the body."

McColgan had a number of high-profile guests at the Trials this year, including high-profile US Olympic coach and track superstar Tommie Smith, who called the 10,000m the toughest ever held by an American.

Smith, who has a longstanding relationship with McColgan at the meet, said: "I've called her to try to talk her into staying. And when I heard her say that, that's what gave me the biggest chuckle in the world
