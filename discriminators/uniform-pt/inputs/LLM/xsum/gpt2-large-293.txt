Greece's new right-wing Syriza government wants to keep access to the island in a bid to boost tourism

Former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was once the island's best friend, living on an ancient island hotel and even living in a small apartment on the island's coast.

He became Chancellor in 1998 with the help of an army of'refugees' he claimed were living alongside Germans and Hungarians who were driven out of the island by the Greeks during the Nazi occupation.

He has spoken of his desire to bring the ethnic Germans and Hungarians back to the island in protest at the lack of a German-speaking version of the island.

Kohl was part of a group of politicians, and historians, that spent weeks searching for the body of 'Tito,' a man they suspected had been tortured and murdered

The'refugees,' Kohl said, 'would have been allowed no German, and they would have died with shame in disgrace for being part of an occupation force.'

The Germans and Hungarians they brought to Kos from Hungary were driven from the island by Greek government forces in 1944 by Hitler's army.

Hitler had signed an agreement with the new Greek government, under which the Hungarians were let out of the island and the Germans – who were the island's only inhabitants – were to be the minority.

According to the British government's official history of the island's occupation, 'Tito and his family are buried in Kos cemetery and as with all British possessions, they are to their last extent to be returned at discretion.'

But despite this guarantee, German activists have continued to live in Kos.

Two British'refugees' are also believed to still be in the island of Kos, believed to be living in a house in the village of Mosel

Kohl also visited Kos on holiday in 1998 when he was still Chancellor.

In his diary, recorded the same year, he wrote:
