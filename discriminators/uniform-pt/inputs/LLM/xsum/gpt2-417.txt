 trial for his alleged role in a botched national day of resistance.

The alleged attempt to assassinate Ponta by two men aged between 20 and 44, who have been in prison since the beginning of 2016, has ignited fury in the east. Police in Bucharest arrested 10 suspects under the same charge on Monday, in what they have labelled Operation Car Wash.

The former premier has denied those in jail at the time took part in the attack at the Car Wash camp, saying "there is nothing wrong with anyone doing anything wrong."

Prosecutor Anzele Belen said on Monday prosecutors had received information from the Bucharest police that Ponta was a wanted member of the Cossacks and had confessed to the killing of his own son and daughter.

Athens is the capital of Romania and has been ruled by more than 100 per cent left-wing governments. It has been a stronghold for opposition parties in protests against the rule of pro-government Justice and Development Party (PD), which has ruled without power in the country since late 2007.

The murder of the father-of-two shocked many people in eastern Romania, once a key transit point between Bulgaria and Romania.

Ponta went to the Maidan to protest the murder, but on 30 November he was stabbed to death by the left-wing party's security forces, who had set up a special checkpoint near his home in a square of Bucharest.

The ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Roman Abramovich, had promised to hold a referendum this November on the legality of the death penalty, with anti-coup troops backed by the ruling elite.

Under Romanian law the prime minister can order a pardon from the authorities in the event that they do not.

A spokesman for the foreign ministry denied in April that Ponta had been "presented" to the authorities with weapons from an outlawed group that had murdered several activists in the south of the country on 10 December.
