 company to receive the announcement of its sudden decline in fortunes.

A quick review of Mr. Guotai's resume reveals little about his actions that would seem to be a cause for concern, but rather how he rose to his current position. In December, 2012, Guotai Securities was founded in Hong Kong, in what was then called Chongming Economic University.

An initial investment from the then US based investors was reportedly over $50 million in the company. Two months later, another $16 million was added in an initial public offering under the name Guotai Global Equity Fund Ltd, or GuTGAEIL. The investment, in fact, was the second of its kind that year, following the previous $18 million investment from one of China's largest pension funds, SICM Global Investors. A recent study found that the investment by these private investors amounted to more than $40 million.

Mr. Guotai continued to lead Guotai from April to May 2013, a period during which it's stated it was expanding rapidly. According to industry sources, the first signs of trouble were detected in this first round, after the company's announcement that it had already lost the chairman and chief executives during a failed IPO.

Mr. Guotai became a company shareholder. This means that for every 50 Hong Kong Dollars invested, Guotai receives a proportion of any subsequent earnings produced. As such, Mr. Guotai has a vested interest in the company until its final death. While the exact figures are not known for this round and only the details of these investor allocations can be divulged; Mr. Guotai may have gotten the second or last penny.

This does not come as a surprise, given Mr. Guotai's alleged close ties with CIM Group. Though CIM was China's first private equity firm to enter the Chinese market, the new partnership brought in an investment of $10 million prior to its founding. CIM has since worked closely with many companies of the Guotai group, including in other Chinese markets as well.
