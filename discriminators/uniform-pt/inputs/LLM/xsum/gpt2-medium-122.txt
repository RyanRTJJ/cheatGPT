 take a picture of his victims as they stood in the street and told the police if they resisted or fled. He then assaulted them again, this time outside their homes.

After a nine-month trial at Derby Crown Court, Singh was convicted by a jury last month of three counts of rape and one of sexual assault, and sentenced to five years in jail.

In court, a defence lawyer said the judge's decision was based on Singh, a "predatory monster".

Singh had sex with more than 20 women over the age of 18 in Derby over the following 12 months, mostly while drunk, he claimed.

The first victim was a 17-year-old boy. The second was a 37-year-old woman. He said the third was a 33-year-old woman.

The next two victims were between the ages of 14 and 15. The third was an age 12-year-old girl.

The most serious crime, called armed robbery, involved the use of a dangerous weapon: a knife and a screwdriver used in his alleged assaults.

After the sentence handed down by Judge Sir Andrew Wilcox, Khatkar's lawyer, Stephen Dutton QC, said Singh was remorseful and determined to give up drugs.

"It was quite tragic that he didn't recognise what he had done," said Mr Dutton. "His life was in a terrible state, but he wanted to repent for what he had done and it's all been taken away and he never gets back what he's put in it."

In his mitigation application, Khatkar also spoke of his father, who has not been seen for 18 months as a result of illness he suffered from. Singh did mention his younger sister, who did not suffer as a result of his actions.

'It is not the outcome one has hoped for'
