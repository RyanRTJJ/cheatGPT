 chair of the COSER, he said: "The COSER, unlike the Department of Immigration, must have the capacity to act. It is simply not on its doorstep to deliver more support.

"In this period of unprecedented public anxiety over the future of Scotland's universities, it is imperative that it is not seen as politically motivated, or the fault of one set of academics, or one set of ministers."

Alex Neil, the SNP peer and minister for higher education, said there must be confidence in higher education.

"Faced with uncertainty over the future of Scotland's colleges," he said, "the COSER must reassure the people with whom it talks that they will be able to provide the public with the high quality public service it expects in future."

A Department for Education spokesperson said: "The COSER was established in 2012 to monitor and report on Scottish higher education in a transparent, independent and respectful manner, providing a reliable independent public sector oversight role of Scottish Higher Education.

"The COSER is a highly respected and trusted independent organisation. They have the full support of the Government."
