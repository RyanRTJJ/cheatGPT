 he is a grey gray in his grave. His job is to take the long view and be as calm as can be when the crisis hits. This is how we will build on the current momentum, get better and stronger, and make the most of the opportunities we have at the moment and in the future. It is all about balance, not sacrifice, he insisted.

But when the crisis does hit, where will the money come from to pay for that new investment? There is a very interesting article in today's Sunday Independent by John Pounds and Gordon MacDonald, entitled: "UK investment needs billions". They say:

By the time the next downturn occurs, the gap between government debt and GDP will be up to £150bn. That's more than the combined debt of Greece, Italy and Spain. The question is whether it becomes a bigger gap when next it comes, or whether the chancellor will find that other sources of stimulus will prove to be too little, too late. His next strategy – a long-term economic plan – faces a massive challenge in dealing with the current spending and tax cuts. …It may be sensible for the chancellor to focus on extending his "long term economic plan" to the year 2021 to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Maastricht treaty, to create a period he will later call "a golden age." But this cannot have the effect of increasing the overall debt-to-GDP ratio … Instead of committing to debt levels which by then will be about 170pc above 2010 levels, the government needs to consider borrowing for the public finances at around 25pc of GDP. To fund that increase in spending, the Treasury would need an extra £8bn this year – equivalent to more than £1,000 for every household; and in future years, in order to maintain the fiscal deficit at 5pc of GDP. These increases in borrowing are clearly unsustainable.

So there's another £15bn over the next 5 years. And just to put this in context, this is money that is supposed to help with the recovery (and it does) but is only
