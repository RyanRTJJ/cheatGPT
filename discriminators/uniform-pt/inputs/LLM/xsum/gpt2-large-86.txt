"This means a lot to us that we will get the opportunity to play in this stadium before the players have trained," Hearts head coach John McGinn said.

"We have trained in the stadium for the last few days and have come very close to getting the date we wanted. We are really pleased and grateful to the fans that have given us encouragement and been so supportive of us.

"This is an incredible opportunity for us to play so many home games in March which can only be good for us. I am really looking forward to it and really looking forward to the team that will be coming to face us.

McGinn will continue with the same 16-player squad that faced Hibs in the League Cup on Saturday, and also has the option to continue with a further 18 players after taking a small number of players out of their squad for the international break on 18 February.

The Scottish Cup quarter-final at the new Caledonian Stadium will be televised live in the UK on STV at 16:00.

Tickets for the match are available via Ticketmaster.com for priced from £25 to £49.99 and from Scottish Borders Railway Station. Visit www.whirlwind.org for more information and any of the clubs facilities.
