 told the story of how their daughter, only 6 years old, was first diagnosed.

On 8 March 2011, at 11am, Sophia’s father, Andrew Gibson, posted the news on the Dravet Syndrome Facebook page that his daughter had now been diagnosed with the condition (1). “It doesn’t make sense,” Andrew would say later, “There’s no logical explanation of what causes the condition.”

Sophia began having seizures soon after she was born in January 2011 and then her father noticed that she didn’t “appreciate new people. She wouldn’t recognise any relatives. She just had this blank look on her face” (2).

Andrew was working as a GP when he saw a “TV advert” (3) mentioning Dravet Syndrome and he called his GP who sent Andrew a link to Dravet Syndrome UK (4).

Soon after, Andrew saw a TV news story, where some children being diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome. “We just knew we had to do something!” he says.

“She’s our priority now.”

Andrew had been told that there are two types of Dravet syndrome: type one, where seizures are the only symptom; and type two, where there “are multiple symptoms in addition to frequent seizures” and patients will have “the intellectual impairment and behaviour problems that are commonly associated with Dravet” (5).

“Initially we were both nervous as it isn’t an easy diagnosis to make,” says Andrew.

Dravet Syndrome UK (DSUK) works with partners to raise awareness and research funding.

Andrew says that Sophia has learning difficulties; she’s not going to high school and probably won’t take the college exams. She can’t even do her school work at home as she prefers to be by herself. Sophia also needs to sit or lie down regularly, and for that she can’t stand up.

Her favourite thing to do is take part in dance class, or go for a walk. The Gibson’s live
