 new, second Irish site, which will employ 1,000 people after an agreement with the British government.

President Trump tweeted that Ireland should have never joined the EU, and that Mr. May is "very clever" for agreeing to the Brexit deal.

The Irish prime minister said that his country will work on a new trading relationship with Britain.

"And we will have a fantastic deal with you," May told Cook. "I know it might be painful to take the next step with you, but I think that is really the right choice."

May made Ireland’s decision to leave the EU underlining Britain’s need to forge a new trade relationship with the bloc now that it is no longer the UK.

“One of the reasons Brexit was hard to take was because of that very simple but important truth: there is a whole new world out there,” she explained to Cook. “You might have been on the outside a few days, but you’ve been a part of the fabric of the European Union for 40 years.

“When we leave, we will look at our relationship with the EU, with all of its member states, not just the 27. We will begin the search for trade deals in which we can trade with like-minded nations around the world. So while you’re with us, we’re going to continue to seek out trade deals around the world, and we’ll pursue new, open economies.”

The president, who made no mention of the controversial Irish border issue on Twitter, told the Irish prime minister that the Brexit agreement “was fair to both sides.”

The Irish government is considering a plan for a new customs border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, a land border would remain, but with no tariffs. The British government announced the new deal on Northern Ireland in December and it is understood the European Union is looking at its future trading relationship to see whether or not a solution for a hard border can be found.
