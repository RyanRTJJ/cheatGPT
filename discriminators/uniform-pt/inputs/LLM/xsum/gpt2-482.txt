 launch event at its recent global Google I/O event, in San Francisco. But when Samsung showed off the project, it didn't have one.

The project, which Google already has on hold until this week, is expected to be put off for six weeks when it ships. If that happens, Google is likely to unveil it under its new name in mid-January.

On the other hand, Samsung still faces serious competition from Android smartphones in terms of market share and device compatibility. And when it comes to battery, the competition is still very much growing to Android's point where a Samsung smartphone is expected to sell for more than one billion dollars in 2020 when it launched.

The latest rumors of Google's plans to develop a smart home are coming from sources who already know Android's best practices better than I can. They're also aware that Google hasn't been happy with Google's decision not to build a smart home as part of its own hardware, something it feels responsible for and will eventually pull from within its own hardware, and that it will continue to be aggressive in pushing to make the smart home easier and more reliable.

It didn't take long for Android to catch on as an increasingly critical market player. For example, with its $400 million budgeted home range offering about two pounds less than other smart home gadgets, even if you buy them at the same time, the company's current plan is to ship more of those units in larger numbers. And yet as the price of those units skyrocket, and prices continue to rise, it's becoming more and more difficult to see Google selling a larger number of smaller smartphones and tablets, much less an entire one.

Android can make things a lot easier for people

There are, however, drawbacks with Android's current system. While Samsung has tried to innovate and deliver a smart home product similar to Motorola's Moto 360, it's still a hard sell for those involved
