 similar law several years ago, but now the EU is asking member states to extend the ban.

The new EU law will have wide-ranging effects across the whole of the 27-nation EU, which has more than 450 million people.

The EU law calls for the regulation in every member state of the whole of this EU law without exception, meaning every packet of meat, dairy, poultry or eggs would have identical photographs, warnings and nutrition data.

A statement on the Council website said: "This regulation will go further than the current EU food law and require not only that the food label be identical for every product on the market, but also that all labels be based on the same graphic material that has been selected based on harmonised criteria. The purpose of this decision is therefore to ensure that EU consumers have a clear, independent, comparable, easy to understand label when buying food products with different origins and the same product quality."

The decision is expected to be adopted in the autumn.

The new law would also require all food products to carry nutritional facts on their labels.

The new regulation requires that all food and beverage products, including foods, ready meals, soft drinks and snack bars should have the nutrition facts, in a manner that's easily legible and clear for consumers. The regulation also calls for the same graphic material to be used, allowing manufacturers to avoid using multiple versions of the same graphic elements.

The European Commission has developed a set of guidelines for the nutritional content of food labels, with a view to make the information easier for consumers to understand.

EU Council president Donald Tusk, who has led the talks on the new law, said the changes were necessary to allow the EU to take the "next natural step", which is to ensure that all food products on the market comply with the directive.

"This makes sense. If you're going to impose the food labeling laws on yourself then at least label them," he said, adding, that it was a "serious issue", adding that the law was good for consumers.

The Commission published the guidelines in late
