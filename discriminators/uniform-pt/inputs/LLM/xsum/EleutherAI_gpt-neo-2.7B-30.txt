acey Smith, 45, told police how she found the girl at her home in Bicknacombe near Stourbridge.

Smith called 999 and said her granddaughter was unconscious on the floor. Emergency services arrived and she was taken to hospital – where she is said to have lost the majority of her grey matter.

On Wednesday the girl’s mother – a former nurse who worked for many years at Bournemouth and Poole Hospitals – died suddenly. Her 21-year-old son, Matthew Thomas Brown, was remanded in custody after being charged with murder on Tuesday.

Tracey Smith said she and her daughter-in-law, who are close to the family, had always been in regular contact with one another. The couple had visited the girl in hospital but had not been able to bring their granddaughter with them.

Smith took her daughter-in-law, Christine Haughton, and children Tracey, 19, Nicholas, 15, and 16-year-old sister, Amelia, to visit the girl in hospital before she died on 18 November.

Smith said: “We met Matthew at the weekend, after a court was told. We had visited him and told him of how good she was until then, and of her recovery. We hoped he would remember the visit of the aunt.”

Tracey Smith added: “She had been at the hospital for three or four months. We had been hoping to bring more people into the family but we had not been able to. We are very angry – she has not been able to have a family reunion. Our daughter is angry and says she feels betrayed by Matthew.”

Brown entered no plea to manslaughter but faces a maximum of 14 years in prison when he appears at Guildford crown court on 16 December. It is expected that Judge Jeremy Richardson will decide whether there is enough evidence to suggest a manslaughter charge is likely.

The family have urged the public to stay away from Brown. A statement read: “We’re angry and distraught following the death of our beloved
