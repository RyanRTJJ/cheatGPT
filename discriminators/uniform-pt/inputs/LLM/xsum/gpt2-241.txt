-year-old woman were found in an adjoining building. Firefighters from West Sussex and Sussex County of Greater Sudbury were on the scene in the town at 12.50pm.

A 16-year-old girl and a 15-year-old girl were both taken to hospitals with smoke inhalation. An additional 16 people were injured at about 12.30am, officials said.

The incident happened about 15:30am at the Mughal village just outside of Rotherham.

The blaze caused minor injuries on the scene. About 400 people, most of them children, took refuge in a building on the site, they said.

Residents from all directions had come to the relief of the fire as of mid-afternoon.

"From a local office that was just a small hill side to a large building we all went out and started walking around," said Mr MacLean, who had arrived from Lancashire.

There were a total of nine bodies at the scene. The victims included 16-year-old Radell.

Residents at the Mughal said they could not believe the cause of the fire.

"When they woke up I was walking down an embankment that was going to lead to the city centre, I had a moment to think and I realised in my gut at a stroke why there was not much fire.

"Luckily the fire wasn't a huge incident and those people weren't so injured that it's a shock to them," said Mr MacLean.

He said it was a really unusual incident as such a number of buildings were affected and it would not be possible to tell exactly how long they will be in flames.
