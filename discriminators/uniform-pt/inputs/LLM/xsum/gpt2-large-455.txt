 help, the council's financial position is 'fraught with uncertainty', the council said.

Councillor Stephen Jones, Leader of the Walsall Council, told BBC Radio Walsall there are around 40,000 residents in the area, of which 'five thousand are members of the community'. He said the area had been on general public support, with the biggest increase in membership since before the new community rules came in.

'The people that live in Walsall have been a great success story for the whole of England.

'They've suffered a lot of unfairness and have had to fight hard for their rights and we have a huge sense of pride in that. But we'd argue that there has been great sacrifice - of which some have got a lot of people back over the last 20 years -and in some ways Walsall is suffering the most because of that.

'If council tax is reduced it could really make a huge difference to the finances,' he added.

A spokesman for Conservative councillor Paul Davies said: 'It's unacceptable that Labour would use the budget to try to hide the fact that they've given a vote of no confidence to a Labour councillor.

'The people of Walsall overwhelmingly voted remain in the EU referendum and would prefer us to be part of Europe now that we are no longer under threat.'

The council's financial figures have been leaked to this newspaper, which is based in Cambridge.

In the 2014-15 government year, Walsall's tax bill was £8.3m - the third highest in England among the 785 local authority areas.

In 2015-16, its tax bill was even more expensive, rising to £21.2m - the sixth highest in England.

Council leader Mr Jones - who is due to retire in 2017 - has not responded to questions from BBC Radio Walsall.
