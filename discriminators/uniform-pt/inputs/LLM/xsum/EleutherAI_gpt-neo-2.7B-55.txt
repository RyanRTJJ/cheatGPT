 come to light since then.

Of them, 141 people had been identified by police as victims and 89 as having CSE-related problems. More than half were aged under 16.

A spokeswoman said: “The report was published to mark the 25th anniversary of CSE. As a tribute to the victims, we will continue to work consistently with affected charities over the coming months.”

The organisation CSE Alliance, which campaigns for the health of young women, said the statistics represented a “huge underestimate” of the crisis. “These children will live with the physical consequences of these toxic, toxic substances for the rest of their lives,” said its chief executive, Catherine Gee.

“They are being exposed to these dangerous drugs, which are all illegal.

“They are being exposed to this violence and to having their emotional health undermined.

“Children today are going from a world of privilege where it's cool to be able to access sex without judgment, to one where they're struggling to say no because they're being rejected.”

Charity worker Charlotte O'Shea, of the MIND charity, said the statistics were “totally unacceptable”.

“Young girls are having to carry the burden that the criminal gangs and the pimps have caused.

“We want to see the police stopping people in the shadows who are causing people pain.”

It is understood that, given the high levels of addiction and mental health problems among young women who use drugs, a “significant proportion will become prostitutes”.

“The problem is the authorities don't do anything about it,” said Mary McAndrew, director of women's health and drugs projects at the British Medical Association, which has campaigned on the issue for years.

“Because prostitution is legal, they don't want to interfere,” she added.

The government does not currently collect data on drugs, alcohol and prostitution in England and does not collect data for Wales, where a separate report shows the majority of rape and sexual abuse crimes committed each year are committed by drug users and ex-drug users.
