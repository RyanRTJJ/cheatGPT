, according to the judges, managed to read at a "record reading level for someone of her age and time".

The young woman, who is yet to release her name at the suggestion of the judge, has had a love-hate relationship with reading, according to the judges.

The woman has had a long-standing problem focusing for lengthy periods of time and had thought reading might be a good way to overcome this. However, there proved to be "a lot to be said against her", according to one of the judges.

After reading a large book, the woman, who is a mother-of-four, would be left exhausted for the rest of the day and "was beginning to understand why so many people were in a hurry to get to bed and that they sometimes felt unable to cope with the day".

On one reading trip the woman said she "cried all the way through". The "self-doubts" she would experience as well as a "sense of powerlessness" left her "unable to read further".

The woman said she would "rather spend a longer time doing something else and read later on".

She had been looking forward to reading a novel by Lee, as she "thought she might enjoy it" and had even asked other individuals "how much and how fast they were reading it".

She said, "When the novel came out on my birthday, she was the one I was thinking about to try and beat".

The woman had expected to finish the novel within 40 minutes, although she had not read the book prior to the competition.

The judges gave the competition winner a score of 477.05.

The woman, who read the book at the University of Leicester, was presented with a copy, a medal and a certificate. She was also offered the opportunity to take up a reader-in-residence position in a school, a job which would require her to work in the library or in the classroom every week,
