The jury members had deliberated over 18 hours at the end of a two-day recess in the case on 23 February after hearing testimony by a forensic expert on the DNA evidence and experts on the DNA evidence.

An autopsy found each victim had been sexually abused. All had bruising around the genital area, and four had injuries consistent with being sexually abused.

Five of the six children in the house were adopted, and both the mother and the father of the sixth child, who lived with them, had been reported missing, the forewoman said.
