atroopers opened fire on the civil rights marchers. The report exonerated the soldiers, but the deaths of the civil rights marchers led to a period of fierce rioting against British rule. Martin McVeigh murdered 16 people at the Ulster Volunteer Force's (UVF) headquarters on 29 May 1974, in reprisal for Bloody Sunday. The murder of Republican activist William McGrath at the GPO in Belfast in 1995 sparked a four-week race riot that left more than 300 people injured throughout the city.

On Thursday morning, a dozen masked men attempted to enter Derry's City Hall via the back entrance. A masked man was chased back into the street and thrown to the ground as he tried to flee. The attempted murder comes less than a week after more than 50 masked men paraded outside Dungannon County Council's Town Hall after storming the building on Monday night. On Wednesday night a masked man was shot dead inside Belfast City Library during rioting that broke out in the city. Meanwhile, two masked men have assaulted two police officers guarding the grounds of a new library on Belfast's Bogside, just weeks after their release from jail on licence.

Following this week's unrest, a police spokeswoman denied that protesters had brought the area to a standstill. According to the PSNI the public and private property damage in the town was low and officers would not be taking any action. During an interview with the BBC on Wednesday night, DUP leader Arlene Foster was asked what she thought about the planned bonfire. She said she believed it to be "a good gesture of goodwill", but admitted it was "not politically correct to do the bonfire yet".

She added: "I've said this to them in the past too, but actually because we have lost so many men in Northern Ireland, it's not politically correct or proper to be taking these things forward yet. It's not an ideal time to be doing these things. I said that quite early on, I was the spokesperson for all of Northern Ireland
