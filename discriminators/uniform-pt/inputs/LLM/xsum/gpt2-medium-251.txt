 stored at the National Pollution Control Center in Shanghai were contaminated with Salmonella and other pathogens. This would make them unsuitable for the human diet.

Two men were seriously injured by the sea creatures while eating wild scallop from the waters off central China's Zhejiang province, the mainland's main inland sea, on Tuesday.

Three days ago, authorities said sea birds killed one woman when they were caught by netting shearers and were then discarded in the sea. One of the injured was severely injured by the sea creatures after eating her dog-meat meal and died, authorities said.

A total of 27 wild sea birds, eight species of sea mammals and a species of crustacean were killed over the three days of incidents, the China Wildlife Protection Association reported last week.

Two sea turtles died last month while eating the sea bird waste, according to the association. A dead sea turtle's "food" consists of the legs it carries, called the shell.

The CFS warned people to avoid consuming the sea creatures.

"Some may think this is a minor issue but it is highly concerning as the sea creatures are one of the main sources of plastic debris dumped by shipping and people. They are also one of the main sources [of sea critters], which are responsible for other species extinction," said a statement by the CFS in Shanghai on Wednesday, carried by news portal China Central Television.

The Hong Kong-based charity warned:

"While some sea animals can be sold for the profit of those who keep them for fun, some, especially those in the wild, are extremely valuable sources of food and are eaten by hundreds of millions of people every year. It is simply not possible to have a sustainable future for those species and, as with anything else, this should not be allowed to pass."

CFS is currently planning a seminar where members attending will receive a presentation about sea food. In addition, a video of the seminar has been created as part of its website.

CFS also noted that people might think the consumption of sea food is an optional matter when sea scallop is being handled
