 medical officer Dr Frank Atherton, who is a keen advocate for housing improvements.

Around 16 per cent of the population currently pay their housing costs with social housing, compared to 23 per cent of those living in the private market. Dr Atherton says those who live in council housing have better health than those in private accommodation. The Welsh Government are determined not to go back to the old way of thinking, instead encouraging landlords to be responsible.

Dr Atherton said: "This is about ensuring that a number of factors are taken into account and that tenants have a better quality of life. I'm not talking just about cleanliness and comfort. "The social housing occupants I've met, and their children, are generally more happy people. I think it is mainly a difference people see on the way in, when they're knocking the doors down looking for a home. In the private market, you get the old attitudes. For whatever reason, people in government feel they should provide decent accommodation. They've been criticised for not doing it in the past but my view is they have to continue as well."

The study will take into account the needs of elderly tenants - currently the youngest who are more likely to be living in council housing. Other key areas of focus will include the effects on asthma rates, physical activity, blood sugar and cholesterol levels.

Research is likely to lead to a number of actions to improve services in Carmarthenshire as part of the Government programme, including the introduction of a social worker to help people with health issues.

Dr Atherton said: "We're interested in hearing tenants' concerns and ideas about improving the areas they live in. If people want better services they should voice their opinions."
