 told Brazilian TV show Fado que o caminho deu certo.

"I had a great time and a great career and there's the right time to end it, although I don't like to get old.

"But with so much respect for Ayrton I had to go my own way at the end of the season to keep my head on track.

"It's important to enjoy life and I can say that the 'road' for me was done.

"I had a beautiful relationship with Williams with only one great rivalry which I will never forget. It was a pleasure to race a Williams."

Massa finished second behind Fernando Alonso in the 2006 world championship, although he was later stripped of the title after Ferrari refused to hand him a third car to use in the final race of the season. His time in F1 was disrupted by the birth of his daughter Tatiana in August 2008 but it was clear when he rejoined McLaren in 2010 that he had been rehabilitated.

Massa left Williams in 2010 but rejoined for the last three races of the 2011 season and enjoyed a second spell at the end of the year.

He won two races for Sauber in 2013, finishing runner-up to Felipe Massa in the drivers' standings, helping the Swiss team to its best-ever finish in the Constructors' championship.

Sauber announced on Tuesday that 2016 would mark the end of Massa's time at the team.

"I wish the team and all the fans worldwide a very happy and successful 2016 season," he said. "Sauber has been a great opportunity for me and for our common dream of Formula 1, and I'm proud to have experienced and participated in two of the most incredible years this sport has ever dreamed of.

"I can only say again that I have so much respect for all who have helped my career. For my entire life I am grateful for this amazing sport and for those people who allow me to make the most of it. To my fans it has been a pleasure for you to share these moments as my colleague and my friends."
