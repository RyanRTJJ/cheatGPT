 of dumping meat from endangered or at-risk species at their US and European headquarters, he added. The former meat monopoly's president, Sergio Chibae, said Tuesday that Brazil is going through a difficult moment of consolidation in the production sector, but "we are open to new competition."

The company has also been criticized for its alleged role in the death of more than a dozen cows last March. They belong to one of the oldest and largest cowherding groups in the country and were found to have been slaughtered at five different farms in the state of Parana, including the farm of Darlene de Quevedo, said a veterinarian who examined the animals.

The company is being investigated for charges ranging from criminal and administrative prosecution to animal welfare violations.

The meat conglomerate has been the subject of accusations that it systematically slaughtered cows that were too young to be sold, and that the animals were kept in crowded conditions.

In March, Brazil's slaughterhouse workers union complained that Temer was not doing enough to regulate the beef industry, the first time a labor union has been able to make demands on Temer directly.

The allegations against the president come against the backdrop of increased protests, especially in the southern state of Maranhão in which thousands of workers went on strike last week.

The Maranhão workers, led by the CUT - the confederation's political arm - want Temer to renegotiate pay, benefits and unionization terms at the meat industry. They have been camped out on beaches since January 25. In its last report, the CUT said it was negotiating pay increases of 25 to 35 percent on average.

In its statement Monday, the CUT called Temer to "stand up for workers' right to organize" and "immediately end the corruption and inhumane practices of the world's largest meat company."

"The CUT demands the resignation of the President and the resignation of Minister do Gomes," said the statement, referring to the government minister
