it just sounds like bad banking practices) is not limited to just the City of London anymore: it's been creeping north as well (see the first link in my previous post). But you know what I mean.

As for the number of stores that will survive and how that compares to the number of shops that are closing - nobody knows. So, the usual caveats apply.

Some recent interesting and potentially newsworthy UK-related developments caught my eye. First, on Sunday, the UK government announced that the government's Department of Health would be moving its London office to one of the City of London's major business quarter, Canary Wharf. This was apparently spurred on by a change in "the nature of the business", and the need to consolidate.

As with so much else going out of the City of London, this move has been met with derision. While on the one hand you have the City, the financial district, and the financial professionals and corporate rares - you still need to work, eat, and drink somewhere. And it's a funny old world. On the other hand, a significant number of businesses, and not just the City's main industries, have offices and staff outside the City. And at this time of the economic cycle, when many areas of the country and the City are doing rather better than others, maybe this kind of thing isn't such a bad idea.

The second development, as far as I know, that made the news but that I hadn't read before was this report on City AM about Barclays and HSBC considering a merger. The idea, apparently, is to create a global banking giant that is capable of competing effectively with the likes of JP Morgan and Citi - and which could offer a broader, if less complex, range of products and services than the two are known for. I think that could potentially be a good thing.

But will banks really offer those kinds of products and services in the future? I'll return to that another time.
