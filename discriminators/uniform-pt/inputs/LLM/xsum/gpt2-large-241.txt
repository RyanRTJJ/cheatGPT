-year-old woman suffered minor injuries in the blaze. Another 23 people were taken to hospital.

The cause of the blaze is unknown. Fire officials said at least six houses were damaged but police could not confirm that.

No other information was available from police, which was only investigating the cause of fire.

The incident comes just days after an early morning fire at a house in Govan which injured four people.

Police say the blaze broke out around 6am on Saturday and quickly spread to another house in the building.

The house was full of smoke as it was being repaired by contractors before it was due to be demolished after the fire, and it took firefighters about five hours to put it out.

All the homes in the Lendel place in Govan have been evacuated. All police cars and vehicles are out with residents from nearby flats.

Searches are underway. The cause and number of those injured have not been released.
