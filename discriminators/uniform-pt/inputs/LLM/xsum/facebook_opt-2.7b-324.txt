The company is facing mounting criticism around the world after some of the handsets' lithium-ion batteries spontaneously caught fire, with explosions that have killed one and injured at least one other person.

On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Samsung Electronics Co. in Canada said the company is making preparations to replace the Note 7 phones.

Samsung's announcement comes as Samsung prepares to face a court in the U.S. state of New York Monday seeking to hold the company liable over the fire danger.

Samsung launched its first smartphone in 2011 to challenge Apple and other smartphone makers.

The world's largest smartphone manufacturer has not said whether it will recall the current version of the Note 7 yet.

The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said last week that it has contacted over 100 firms including China Mobile USA and AT&T Inc. to request the recall of those phones.

"We are currently working on a plan to replace Galaxy Note 7 devices in an effort to address safety concerns and reassure our customers," said Samsung Electronics in a statement Saturday.

"Samsung Electronics will consider all options to return the affected units as quickly as possible, and those returning the device won't have to pay for a replacement," the statement added.

U.S. federal officials are examining how to deal with the exploding handsets and have not yet decided whether they will ban them.

Some U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Honolulu, have already announced bans on the phones.

In South Korea, Samsung temporarily suspended shipments of the phone to stop them from being used by consumers.

The company also said it has started working on a replacement device, but a new device has not yet been announced.

In December, Samsung said it was conducting an internal safety review of the Note 7 phone.

At the time, the company released an emergency service update aimed at making the Galaxy Note 7 phone less susceptible to explosions caused by the batteries.

However, the firm could not guarantee the changes would make the phones safer.
