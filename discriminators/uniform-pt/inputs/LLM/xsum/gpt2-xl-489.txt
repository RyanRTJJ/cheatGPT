He has now been ruled out of the team's next two games, as well as coming back on the pitch for the game at the Melbourne Rebels this weekend.

Munster are now hoping to be able to bring back one or two other players for the clash with the Rebels at ANZ Stadium on Sunday, 14 July.

In another major blow to Munster, centre John Afoa suffered a serious knee injury in that game, which forced him to undergo surgery. The injury could take up to six months to fully heal, so will probably see the South African back out of action for another three months.

Kilcoyne has also been ruled out of action after suffering a serious shoulder injury at the weekend, though, after being given a good prognosis just hours earlier.

The Ulsterman suffered the injury at the end of last season, suffering it in the closing stages of an encounter with Ospreys, and underwent surgery for the injury next week.

Meanwhile, Munster wing Andrew Conway has been ruled out for up to eight weeks with a hamstring tear, while fellow outhalf Dave Kilcoyne has been returned to Cork following the surgery required to repair a serious shoulder injury.

Both players picked in last weekend's 24-14 loss to the Dragons, as well as forward Ollie Devoto, remain fit to have another go at the club.

The Munster line-up will be confirmed tonight before next Thursday's clash against the Rebels in Brisbane.
