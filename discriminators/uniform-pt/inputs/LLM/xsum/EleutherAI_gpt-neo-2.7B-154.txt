 MP Conor McGinn taking on the role of Shadow Minister with responsibility for Health.

His resignation follows that of party treasurer Dr Jim Allister, who recently returned to his position from the EU to take on responsibility for agriculture and a move which left Mr McClarty temporarily with only seven of the 120 party MPs – with a vacancy in the next round of the General Election to be decided in the next few weeks.

He resigned amid a growing controversy over what is being called an “arms race in the party” with Alliance seeking to outdo them in public relations and internal democracy.

Dr Allister was appointed in mid-December after it became clear that the UUP could not form an internal agreement in response to the party’s decision to split from the DUP and instead seek an alliance with the Conservatives.

Mr McClarty will remain as Chairman of the Executive Committee, with his resignation seen as giving the new leader more of an authority in line with their public pronouncements.

Speaking to RTE, Mr McClarty said: “The party is in a tricky situation and I wish to take responsibility for all the difficulties.

“In times like these, people will understand I had to look after them. It wasn’t just about myself anyway. The party is in serious trouble and its members will be made aware of that.”

Alliance’s leader of Northern Ireland assembly delegation in Stormont, the Reverend James McShane, said: “I am absolutely disgusted. It is all very depressing. I would call on all the politicians involved in all the positions to resign and allow the party a chance to reorganise.

“It’s not my responsibility. It doesn’t fall to me. That’s not what I’m about. It is my responsibility to look after the party. If it goes in to some sort of an arms race it will only do the party’s reputation further a few notches down.”
