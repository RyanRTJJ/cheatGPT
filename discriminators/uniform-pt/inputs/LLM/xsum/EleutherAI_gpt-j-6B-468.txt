In related news, it has also been revealed that a series of virtual reality images from artist, author, illustrator, animator, explorer and film-maker Tim Burton will go on display at Museu Nacional de Arte do Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro National Art Museum) from next year.

Visitors are invited to experience a series of short films and virtual worlds created and designed by Burton.

He has collaborated with VR developer Virtuix, to create a VR video of a virtual ride through his 'world' of characters which will be viewable from a VR headset in the museum.

The museum will put on an immersive experience, where users are invited to "step into the museum as if they were really there, experiencing the magic through a VR headset", a museum spokesperson said.
