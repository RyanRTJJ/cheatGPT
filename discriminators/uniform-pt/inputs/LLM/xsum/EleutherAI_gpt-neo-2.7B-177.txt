2 hours per week, or about 30 hours less than required.

This is the second time the Department of Education has asked teachers in England to record how much time they spend on non-teaching tasks. But in 2004 the school time survey was scrapped because it was considered outdated and not representative.

This kind of work takes a long time to complete and can take up to 30 hours per week at the minimum, so it is vital that students are well rested so that they're able to carry out the work, the study time policy said in its publication.

The report will be discussed alongside other research on the topic in the Schools Cymru conference, to be held in Wrexham, Wales on 18-20 May.

The EIS also spoke to teachers in Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff, Oxford, and Bristol. Here is what they had to say:

The study found that the average teacher spends 28.4 hours a week on teaching practice, with the average primary school spending almost as much time on teaching practice (29 hours). The most common reasons for working extra hours are for marking a class paper, writing reports of a different kind or doing special tasks for which there is no other option to use teaching practice time, such as marking the results of a special assignment or marking a quiz. Over 20% of teachers said they spent more than 20 hours a
