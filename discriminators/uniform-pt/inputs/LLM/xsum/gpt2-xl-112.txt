 policy on services for people with mental health problems after it received a complaint from a complainant: "It is not our policy to provide services to patients with conditions which cannot be assessed in order to minimise the level of anxiety when they go into our department. This is based solely on the requirement to minimise risk to our patients and our staff. We will work to accommodate this on a case by case basis."

Dr Sarah Harrison, co-ordinator of the mental health unit at Gloucester Hospital, said that the service "gives patients reassurance that they are not being stigmatised and that they can get all the treatment or support they need as they need it". She said the NHS should not make "prejudicial" decisions about those with a history of mental illness.

"We have been working with the NHS to find out what is the ideal scenario that would support public confidence. The NHS is putting the appropriate resources into this. We are doing everything we can to help patients in their recovery. There can be very significant barriers to support such as the availability of facilities, the lack of funding and how difficult it is for people with mental illness to access treatment," she said.

Dr James Brown, chair of the mental health committee of Staffordshire, said the service would continue despite the change in policy at some hospitals. He said: "I think there are no good excuses for that. We are not trying to shut the door to anybody – it's about providing quality support as quickly as we can. There is no reason that we can't keep that service up at all times."
