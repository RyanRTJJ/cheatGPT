 at the same time being at least 70% like a portrait of one of the artist's contemporaries.

The process involved the computer mapping out the image, then adjusting the colours and contrast to create the portrait.


A portrait of Sir John Soane

It took around two months to complete, and was commissioned to be commissioned by Sir John Soane, the painter whose early work was one of the inspirations behind Rembrandt's style. The portrait was painted in the style of a Rembrandt, but with a slightly different background colouration and background. The colour and composition for the painting was selected by a team of colourists and was created by combining both colour from soane's original paintings, and a mix of coloured pieces of artwork created by a team of colourists for the Rembrandt portrait, as well as colours for the coat of arms and the portrait of Sir John.

It follows on from a similar portrait of Sir John created by artists, called the 'Dawning of the Light', which was created to mark the opening of the Mona Lisa Gallery in 1997, at which the paintings sold for more than Â£1million.

"Sir John loved his Portrait of Sir John so much that he created a second one at around the same time as this by using his own work as inspiration, but with much darker colours," said lead colourist on the new work, John Wilson, the artist's nephew. "He wanted something completely original that would really speak to him."

To achieve that, the researchers used what they describe as their 'photoshop' technique. Colourist Adam Faget used advanced computer software to take the original painting and then digitally manipulated the image - making it appear more like a piece of Rembrandt but also at the same time using colour to produce the impression of some kind of detail.

The team then took the results of
