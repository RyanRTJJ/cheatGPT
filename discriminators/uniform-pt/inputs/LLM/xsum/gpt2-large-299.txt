 the site went online only after authorities launched an investigation.

Yunnan State Petroleum Corporation, the firm behind the leak, has refused to comment on the case or to allow the media to watch it on the website, which the company insists is a government building.

It is also unclear whether the leak is a case of willful misconduct by a company or individual.

A spokesman for the Yonhap News Agency that runs the website declined to comment on the reported theft of documents.

Kim Won-ho, a national security expert at Kookmin University in Seoul, said the hack came at a delicate time for both South Korea and Taiwan in coming to terms with the fallout from a spying scandal that started in January 2012, when the Ministry of National Defense admitted it was spying on South Korea's top nuclear scientists.

Kim said that Kim appeared to have been "too close to the top, and that he was not going to the bottom to figure things out," but did not elaborate.

As tensions between the allies rise, the hacking could not only cause harm to relations but also send a chilling message to all companies across the region.

Hackers have also targeted Chinese companies and their top officials for years.

South Korea has accused China of using cyber espionage to undermine diplomatic relations and exert military control in parts of the South China Sea. Chinese officials deny any such activities.

The hacking comes as a diplomatic spat has erupted between Seoul and Beijing, after Seoul demanded an apology from Beijing for its decision to call off a plan by Taiwan to join the North-South Economic Partnership forum in Beijing. Beijing says Seoul is interfering in its internal affairs and threatening its national security.

Analysts also question whether the hack can be attributed to an individual or a group. Yun says that if there was one responsible, it would have come from the government
