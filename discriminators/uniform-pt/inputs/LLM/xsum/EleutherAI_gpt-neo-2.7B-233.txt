 doctor visits, and that fewer people would develop a "superbug", resistant bacteria.

It is estimated at least three million people have no regular contact with the NHS, and some 20 percent of the population under the care of primary care doctors do not do so. Most non-emergent tests are paid for on the NHS, and are carried out by GPs and hospital specialists, who may see people for other reasons such as cancer. The rest are used by private company GPs for their own costs. It is the latter practice that the GP commissioning group is hoping to ban.

It is thought more than 90 percent of the appointments are for minor ailments such as colds and hay fever.

The report, published by the GP commissioning group, called for reforms in commissioning and payment arrangements for GP clinics, including an end to the use of the walk-in centre, and payment systems and contracts that better matched patient need.

The chief executive, Joanne Chugg, said the report was one of the first of its kind, and it would be followed by further evaluations.

"We need to make sure that the patients still see their GP when they need to, at the right time, and in the right place and in a time and place they can understand. Patients want to see their GP every day, not every year," she said. "This report calls for people to have more choice of where, when and how they make appointments."

There is no charge for walk-in services, and those over 62 can use the service on the NHS at no extra cost. It is estimated that 1.6 million people used the service over a 12-month period. Of those who used the service, 5 million attended, up from a previous 4 million.

The GPC is due to publish a paper on the findings in December, and is planning a major conference in February to discuss the implications for primary care next April, said Chugg.
