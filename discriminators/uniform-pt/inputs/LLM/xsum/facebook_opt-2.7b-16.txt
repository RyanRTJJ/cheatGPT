 on the classroom floor. These children have to wear helmets when cycling on the school's path to help them keep control of their bicycles.

But the school decided it could not give out helmets and bikes so they came up with an alternative. The children were told they could buy them at a discount store or with their school's food money.

Some children were keen to buy a helmet with a cartoon character on it while other were disappointed this could not be done. There were cries of "But my face is pink" and "Why can't I have a pink helmet?"

However, Bethany Lambeth said if they did not buy a helmet they would not get to go on to the school's nearby walking track.

And students who bought a bike helmet could choose the kind that they wanted and the colour.

But she said that many of them were still complaining.

"I was teaching a lesson on addition and it was my turn with a group of 9- and 10-year-olds and I put one of the kids on a bicycle and told them to go ahead. While he pedalled the other children would be on the bike behind him.

"He'd say, 'What's this?' and move the bicycle and I'd have them move it back. And they weren't really listening to what I was saying, because they were moving about!

"I finally got to his bike and he started moving forward and before I realised it he was in a ditch."

To encourage healthy lifestyle change, the children were then sent to a nearby store where they could buy their choice of healthy food items including a pack of biscuits for £4.50, a tinned tuna for £2.80 and soft drinks for £1.55.

A spokesman for the school said: "The bikes were a gift to the children from the childrens' food money and there was concern about giving them away. One staff member said the children are not allowed to come in and buy a toy, so what could be a better gift than a bike?"
