The UK has one of the most successful antibiotic regimes of any developed country, thanks in part to the National Health Service drug collection and the National Antimicrobial Surveillance System, which checks the incidence of resistant organisms in the community (see above).

But as the letter pointed out, Britain’s success at tackling the bacteria stemmed in part from its isolation, with the health service and hospitals largely insulated from the medical consequences of antibiotic resistance. The rest of the world is far from immune.

“It is now clearer than ever that the UK is the safest place for British citizens to live because of the exceptional surveillance and control of antimicrobial resistance,” they said.

The first signs of resistance appeared in the 1960s. In the mid-1970s, several British doctors suggested that the use of antibiotics might one day become the new AIDS (see story here).

In Britain, resistance first started to emerge just after the millennium, when a woman in Ireland stopped responding to antibiotics in 2005. The next episode happened on the US continent after a man in France died within a year of receiving the antibiotic imipenem last year.

So many cases were seen in Denmark that the country announced a ban on antibiotics, while the Netherlands imposed restrictions to prevent their overuse. More and more of the drugs that are now being used to treat “superbugs” were already on the market before the resistance started to emerge.

One of the leading causes of antibiotic resistance was a bug that had emerged in animals before the 1960s, a group called multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MRE). Some of the bugs have now mutated into drug resistant forms and have spread across Europe, the World Health Organisation has said.

The MRE bugs can also cause superbugs in people. The bacteria from the bug that led to the death of a young man in Spain were shown this year to have become resistant to all kinds
