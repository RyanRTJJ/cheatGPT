, with many being jailed for up to a year.

The law has long been criticized by rights groups for being poorly enforced and used as a tool to coerce or blackmail women.

Under Saudi Arabia's strict version of Islam, divorce is not permitted for women in Islam, and any marriages made without Islamic approval are void.

A similar law was recently extended to include atheists and some sects of Islam that don't believe in a belief in one God.

The Gulf kingdom is also accused of not doing enough to promote women's rights.

The New York-based Human Rights Watch reported on Jan. 14 that two Saudi women, including a daughter of King Abdullah, were executed in a Saudi prison for adultery, after they had been detained for 10 months.

The death sentences were issued by a Saudi court in the town of Mecca on Jan. 14, three months after they were charged with adultery. They had spent two years in prison.

Last week, the United Nations launched an international campaign against the kingdom's "extremely serious human rights violations," saying it was "indistinguishable from crimes against humanity."

"There is a lot of public anger and people are upset," said a senior United Nations official who spoke on condition of anonymity because diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia remain frozen.

The rights watchdog Amnesty International said last week that women face a "terrible level of violence and harassment," while Human Rights Watch said Saudi authorities were failing to "take all necessary steps to prevent women from falling into the clutches of abusive husbands."
