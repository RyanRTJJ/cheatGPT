The National Association of Schoolmasters in Theatre (NASUWT) of Northern Ireland says teachers will be joining striking students in schools across Northern Ireland over issues including pay, workload and jobs.

He said the union was also urging teachers to lobby on social media, email and text to demand they be protected from any compulsory redundancies.
