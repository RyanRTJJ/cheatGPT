 NBC News show that a significant number of young people are dying around the country in ways that appear suspicious.

So far, 31 people under 25 have died in 18 major cities since July 1. In New York, at least six children have died by drowning in public pools since early July, and a father and his 6-month-old son fell from a third-story balcony in Philadelphia. Two young children — a 6-year-old boy who stepped out of a car to visit a friend in Austin, Texas, and a 1-year-old girl who wandered away from her family in Houston — died after their parents ignored the kids while trying to sleep, according to media reports.

Although the number of drownings is far below what is usual for the summer tourist season — just last year, there were a record 7,280 reported drownings across the 48 contiguous states from May 1 to September 30 — experts say there is no safe way for parents to supervise their children in pools today, even without a life jacket on them.

"Kids can sneak to the side of the pool and then run away from the edge. Children get pulled out of the pool by currents, even if their faces are not in the water," says Dr. Marc Sternberg, chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who was a child life specialist for more than a decade.

Experts say the trend may be the result of a phenomenon similar to the phenomenon that caused the water-safety crisis of the 1990s, when there were over 1,000 drownings during a normal summer season. The death toll may seem surprising in part because there is nothing unusual about these drownings, apart from the fact that many of them have occurred in swimming pools.

The trend started in July with the drowning of an 8-year-old boy in Maryland, which is not that far from where one of the deaths occurred this year. After
