Atkinson was involved in two other high-profile controversies related to the subject of religion. In July, he made a "joke" about "paedophilia and Catholicism" live on TV, while during the 2014 Eurovision Song Contest in Copenhagen, he criticised the host country after his group Black Lips were barred from performing by Denmark's Immigration Service.

Atkinson married American author Emma Donoghue in January 2017 in County Wicklow, Ireland.

 In September 2019, Atkinson was involved in another religious controversy after delivering a speech at the British Society of Magazine Editors' annual conference in which, during a discussion on social media and censorship, he advocated against the "overcrowding of free speech". The speech was later withdrawn by the organisers after complaints over the perceived anti-Islamic tone of the comments, as Atkinson quoted a passage from an anti-Islam polemicist that compared "Islamists" to Nazi Germany, according to the The Guardian."

In October 2019, Atkinson and three others were arrested after an alleged incident in the city of Sheffield, where he had driven into the back of another vehicle and left the driver for dead in the street outside his local mosque, later threatening him with a knife.

Publications
In 2006, Atkinson wrote a humorous guide for new Christians called The Unbelievers' Guide to the Church Fathers, including a chapter on how to deal with the Bible. In late 2010, Atkinson published his book The Backroom Boys: The Secret Life of the Premier League, with co-author Phil Brown, a reporter for the Evening Standard. His book also details how "the secret life of the Premier League" and the playersâ€™ gambling habits that were alleged in the 2008-2009 football scandals. The publication has received praise for showing the darker side of the football world and for putting the gambling industry in the spotlight.
