"When I looked back and saw them on the beach, I said to him: 'You're not my princess, are you?' He said: 'Of course not.' And I said, 'If you see it, I've never seen anybody else take me before that.' He said: 'And I've never seen you on my property. Why do you want me there? No, I've never seen you.'"

He described the way he had been treated at the palace as "deeply traumatised", saying he "has spent so much time in the custody of Princess Diana's daughter that I have never had to deal with her again".

He added: "The prince went back from the beach with my daughter all the way to the airport a couple of days later and asked for her to go where I was due to go. She was very upset by me saying she didn't know anything about it. That's when the prince found out."

He denied he had tried to harm Princess Diana, and claimed he had "never even heard of her".

The prince said he was unaware of any such relationship. "What's wrong with you?" he asked the prince. "Why would I want to do that?"

He apologised. "I said I couldn't understand people's feelings so I said: 'Why don't you explain to me why she shouldn't see me, you don't make me understand anything so why are you bothering you?' It was the last thing she would ever ask me about. I had nothing in common with him, I said to myself."

He promised to provide further support. "But if I get involved in another thing or anything, maybe she wants to see me, maybe she is upset and I should leave her alone," he said.
