 central London on Saturday about his concerns that Britain is ‘sucking in’ as the nation’s obesity rate increases to around 40 per cent.

In a speech entitled ‘Sucking In: Food and Health In Today’s World’, he highlighted new research to be unveiled at the festival, which he said showed that over three-quarters of consumers are influenced by social media.

The peer said: “Obesity is clearly a societal problem, not a personal problem, and it is one in which there may not be enough persuading. If people are going to get obese, you might as well try and convince them not to.”
