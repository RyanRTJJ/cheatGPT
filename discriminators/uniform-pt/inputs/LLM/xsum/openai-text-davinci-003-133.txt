nd if I have to have a bigger name then Idris would make a great Supa Cop.

"It would be an awesome dream to come true."

So far the street artist is keeping the movie's plotline under wraps, but revealed it will feature a gold rocket being stolen.

He told the newspaper: "The gold rocket is stolen. It is up to me, or whoever they get to play Supa Cop, to get it back and find out who stole it.

"The landscape is between London and Manchester. We are looking at doing a lot of filming in the north-west of England.

"The film will be set in the north. I want to make sure the surrounding environment is a proper representation of what kids are doing today."

Meanwhile, Stormzy's second album, Heavy Is the Head, is set for release this Friday and he has already created headlines with his collaboration with Ed Sheeran, Take Me Back To London.

The track makes reference to the Grenfell Tower tragedy, which is close to the Londoner's heart.

Speaking about the song recently, Stormzy said: "I wrote it in the studio the week after my headline set at Glastonbury, it felt crazy to have risen so far and felt like I had to address the fact I come from such an underprivileged place, and not just ignore it.

"For me to be where I am, I have to thank God and my family who raised me and shaped me. You can have all of the success in the world but it is nothing without understanding your foundation".
