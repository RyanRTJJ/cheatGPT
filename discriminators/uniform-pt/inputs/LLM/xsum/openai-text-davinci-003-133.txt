e way the firm had handled their requests for refunds.

The Committee heard evidence from former customers and representatives of Volkswagen (VW) who defended the company's decision to refuse some customers' requests for refunds of their deposits following the carmaker's emissions scandal two years ago.

The Committee was told that some customers felt they had been treated like "second-class citizens" by the carmaker and that there had been inconsistencies in the way the company had handled their requests for refunds.

The Committee also heard from members of the VW Customer Services team who argued that the company had an obligation to treat all customers fairly and had done everything possible to ensure that those affected received their refund.

The Committee is expected to publish its findings in due course.
