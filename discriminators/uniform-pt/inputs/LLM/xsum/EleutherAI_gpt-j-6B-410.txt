iano Fuentes.

Mr Fuentes helped Lance Armstrong win the Tour de France in 1999, 1999 and 1999. He was banned from cycling in 2005 and, after the Spanish anti-doping agency ASO began an investigation, admitted to running a doping programme and implicated other top cyclists, including Armstrong's fellow countryman Joseba Beloki.

Beloki was given a one-year ban from the sport following an ASO investigation, and another two Spanish riders – Angel Luis Gomez and Igor Gonzalez Galindez – were given two-year bans.

The news now emerges just as Armstrong's book about his life with the US Postal Service, L.A. Confidentiel (No Secrets), is about to be published.

In L.A Confidentiel, he claims the ASO was responsible for his comeback following his fall from grace at the end of his career.

Armstrong wrote: "So now that I'm in great shape, healthy, and back on the bike, I know I can win more important races and contend for major championships."

Armstrong has said he would not compete in the 2012 Tour de France. Asked what advice he would give to cycling's governing body, the UCI, he said he would tell them there is "no hope".

He added: "I've said it before and I'll repeat it now: I have nothing to lose. I won't be on the podium, and I won't win a single major, but for me it was clear that my only hope was to try for the podium. But the UCI doesn't want the world to see its flaws. So it will just say I'm a cheater, and that I deserve to go to jail."

Tinkoff rider Sergey Chernetskiy was also named in an ASO doping report.

The report says Chernetskiy admitted using EPO in August, September and October 2010.

The Spanish rider finished seventh in the 2009 Tour de France, with Armstrong second, before the Armstrong scandal broke.

His trainer, Juan Carlos Arregui, is said to have injected him and another rider, Ivan Basso, directly into their hands.
