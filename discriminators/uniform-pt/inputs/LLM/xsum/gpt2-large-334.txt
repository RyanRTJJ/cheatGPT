'd been drinking with friends in a pub in a Manchester suburb, but they all then returned to the house and he took her to his house.

Nolan then told police that he had had sex with Parker "until she passed out", when he stabbed and raped her. Detective Superintendent Stuart O'Brien agreed with Mr Nolan's version of events and added that Parker was the last person in the living room before he left his house. Mr Nolan told the court that he believed he was the victim of a "he said, she said" case, and accepted the prosecution's evidence of the murder.

The Old Bailey heard that Katelyn Parker lived with her parents in Stretford, south Manchester.

Nolan and fellow co-defendant James Riddle drove home while Parker was being attended to by paramedics in the hospital. An ambulance crew was summoned after police received a 999 call from the home of a woman who had come home from the theatre.

Judge Christopher Thomas QC said the sentence Nolan received was the "meanest a jury can give" and that he had "an inordinate amount of remorse" about how he had behaved.

"The only thing I wish to say to Mr Nolan is that he may be grateful that your sentence allows you the opportunity to seek a long penance," Judge Thomas said.

Parker's mother, Laura, said she was "delighted" with the sentence, calling it "a fitting conclusion to an awful ordeal".

She added that her daughter had spent four years fighting for justice and described the sentence as "a fitting end to the story".

Detective Inspector Andy Walker said: "This was an incredibly violent, depraved crime, so we want anyone who can help us locate the offender or people seen in this incident urgently to get in contact because they could be our best hope in bringing this man to justice."

Mr Nolan claimed "alcohol had played a big part" in the incident, admitting that he had been drinking with Riddle when they returned to the house
