 he opened fire on a group of men who had kidnapped him shortly before in May 1984.

Judge Smyth said there were conflicting opinions as to the level of Mr Fenton's involvement but he could not be "sure that on the balance of probabilities he was in the wrong place at the wrong time".

"When an individual is killed that is a great tragedy," he said.

In the case against the other three men, the judge said the evidence was more "consistent" with the involvement of their co- conspirators.

Spencer Harber was described by police as the "head cook" of the kidnap plot. He died of a heart attack in 2007.

Det Sgt Colin McCauliffe, who headed the investigation, told media that it was the largest trial of its kind "in over 20 years".

The three co-conspirators are James McMurtrie, from Newtownards, Co Armagh, William Dooley from Kilkeel, Co Down, and Robert Lonergan of Foyle, Co Louth. Lonergan is serving a life sentence for the abduction, shooting and murder of Special Branch agent Joe Fenton. Four convicted men are not being named for legal reasons.

The men, who were all in their 30s, claimed the kidnapping was a hoax involving the Irish Republican Army (IRA), but they were convicted of conspiracy to kidnap.

The six men were originally accused of kidnapping and murdering Mr Fenton but a deal was agreed with them in February after they admitted to conspiracy to kidnap. At that stage, McMenamin, Lonergan and Dooley were already in custody. They were charged with the murder after a post-mortem established Mr Fenton's cause of death to be multiple gunshot wounds.

In October 2015, a jury took just five hours to reach a verdict in the case of the three men who were originally charged with murder.

The Irish News will continue to update readers with new developments in the case.
