While the Cabinet Office is keen to get people to take on new jobs, the government has been told to give an open invitation for anyone to apply.

No-one has yet been employed as a teacher at Buckingham Palace, the Home Office or Westminster City Council, but some have been brought in to set up and run office functions, such as the "new office of digital strategy".

There was unease among some MPs on Thursday that the number of key jobs being handed to private interests was likely to rise, with a particular focus on the new role of a commissioner on digital innovation.

"I can understand people's concerns but I believe we've done a good job at safeguarding the position of civil servants," a senior government source said.

"There are a huge number of big, complex technical issues in digital that need to be solved by people working in a range of government departments. We're really proud of the whole system which we're driving at national level."

A Cabinet Office spokesman said the commissioner would work closely with Whitehall departments and would be expected to report to the Cabinet Office, but would not report regularly to ministers.

"The secretary of state has put out a call for a new commissioner to provide support for the Secretary of State on our digital strategy," he added.

"This is an important role given that the UK is a leading player in digital innovation and has been for some time. The government has put together a very clear and robust approach to digital policy and engagement that is designed to make sure all relevant departments are working together effectively to promote digital economic development and a thriving economy.

"As we move through the digital era, the job of a digital strategy commissioner will continue to increase in importance and be one which helps ensure an effective and efficient government in developing a clear direction for what should and shouldn't be going on. There are a large number of key challenges and challenges that need to be addressed in order to deliver successful digital transformation across an increasingly interconnected network
