 video, which it can now ignore while switching to another program.

At the same time, a little-remembered security vulnerability in Microsoft Word (not shown below) caused hackers to gain access to more than 50% of the Office 2010's files, and the company has since patched the vulnerability.

Microsoft says it has not noticed or investigated the problem in its customers' machines. This article has been updated for clarity and to reflect a change in the software bug.

In this post it was assumed both systems where shown to be fully patched. We regret the lack of accuracy, as Microsoft has not yet commented on the matter.

Computer maker Samsung is about to introduce a radical new concept, called "Nano Display", a display system that uses pixels of different size, just like a comic book.

It has been called a quantum screen, because it uses a quantum-sized array based on nano-sized pixels.

"Samsung hopes that with a nano panel that can produce full colour images and has a pixel pitch of 80 nanometres, the ultra-slim, bendable display can display hi-resolution images for 3D movies, videos and games, while still maintaining a small form factor," reports Computer, which first reported on the new screen.

The new screen is smaller than the existing panel in which it will be embedded - which is not surprising, Samsung itself says: "With its size of 320x190, 160 pixels across, there's virtually no visual and functional compromise with an existing panel."

A smaller pixel size means the screen will be cheaper to produce and install: it will produce less heat and use less power.

"Our unique nano display technologies could enable the world's first true quantum display to be produced for a truly pocket-sized device with a size of only 9mm", it says.

Samsung has previously hinted that this might be closer than thought: a report last year said that its "NanoTFT" technology would be used in a 4.8" display for TVs.

A similar "quantum" screen with 8bn pixels is being developed by Samsung's rival Sharp to enable 3D. This is being produced for use
