, who spotted problems in one of his customers' sites.

Although the affected websites were only in French and German, there could be other vulnerable sites around the world.

Vulnerable versions of Safari use a feature called X-frame-Options, which allows websites to decide whether they want outside elements to be included or excluded in the frame.

Many other websites use a similar feature to include or exclude ads that appear, for example, on third-party sites such as YouTube.

However, sites can use the feature to exploit security problems without the victim being aware of it.

Apple is planning an update to fix the issue, according to the company. Although it is not known when this update will be available. When the update does arrive a warning will be sent to the browser and a pop-up blocker will prompt the user that the website has been flagged as potentially dangerous.

At present, there is no fix for the problem, although sites that are affected need to change how they code their websites in order to resolve this vulnerability.

It could be possible that some of the websites affected in this particular case could actually be using the X-frame-Options feature in a "safe" way if they have updated to a more recent version of the browser.

However the bug means they are potentially open to a "man-in-the-middle" attack. This is where a browser could be used to replace an ad with another advertisement, that the site owner has not agreed to include.

The code can be found in the JavaScript part of the site. Developers can use different frameworks that contain the code, such as jQuery and YUI.

Because of the way the code is written, it is impossible for the developers to know whether a site using any of those frameworks is affected by the bug.

However, the only websites that need immediate attention are those that have used the default methods to include the X-frame-Options in the code.
