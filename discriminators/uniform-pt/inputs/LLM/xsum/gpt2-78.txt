In May, Sean McConville was found dead in his Dublin home as part of an operation by the Derry Sheriff Service in the village of Minslay, in the West Armagh. A police spokesman told the Sun: 'The body of Christopher McConville has been found in an outhouse in the village of Minslay, south of the village of Glenbrook. He was found sitting in his sleeping bag holding his cell phone and body part, which is believed to be in his possession. He had made arrangements for some clothes. The Garda could not confirm whether he had been taken to the graveyard for cremation or not as there was no evidence that he had been disturbed by any unusual or dangerous movements.'

A cemetery home in West Belfast was last used for burying McConville after he was stabbed three times at the scene of a murder outside his farmhouse in 1994. The family and many friends of McConville have been shocked by his murder to which he is also connected.
