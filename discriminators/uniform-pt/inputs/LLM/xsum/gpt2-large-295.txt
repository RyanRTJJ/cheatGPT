m of new asphalt paving has been laid.


The NW200 now uses 4.5km of new paving which has been laid by Arup and has been funded by Sport NI. A further three-quarters of the new paving is being laid by Arup in Ballycastle, Donegal. Other contractors in the area also perform the work.


As of September 2016, the number of cars, cycle and pedestrians on both sides of the road in the area had returned to pre-road closure conditions.


A full statement from Sport NI, below:


A year after the Wigston crash, a decision was taken not to replace a damaged portion of the cycle scheme at Wigston. A new section was built instead with cycle pavements at both sides of the road while the original damaged portion was cleared and replaced. With only limited road construction taking place at the time, the costs over the following year were relatively low.


However, if the decision to keep the cycle park at Wigston had been made back then, this scheme may have needed to be delayed at a time when the overall cost-effectiveness of installing cycling paths was very much questioned. However, with only minor reconstruction, the safety benefits are greater than the short-term costs.


With the additional cycle paths which have now been built around the cycle park, approximately 300 cyclists are now using the site on a daily basis. This increased use is also showing improvements in both cyclist and motorist understanding of a cycle parking arrangement. Overall Cycle Park Road is estimated to be improving cycle safety in Northern Ireland, with significant improvements in all six key categories which are monitored by the Department of Transport.


Our ongoing work on the Wigston Park Improvement Scheme, which ran from October 2009, will see a final stretch of two lanes of cycle track built towards the top of the hill behind the Wigston Park. That process is still in progress and remains under way.
