Channel 4 aired only one of the three repeats. Dara O Briain hosted the show.

Last year, Channel 4 said it was aiming to increase online viewing of its shows by 30-40%.

As well as the figures for its digital streaming service, the channel said it had added 2,400 hours of traditional television for subscribers to catch up.

The number of adults who watched this month's prime time drama, The Night Manager, was down 1% (1.98 million) compared with the previous month, while the number of children on Netflix dropped for the fourth month in a row (down 10%).

The total number of minutes that had been spent on Netflix was down 14% compared with the previous month.

Channel 4 chief executive Jack Tunnicliffe said the "low demand" had forced the broadcaster to offer new shows at higher prices.

"With premium streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and on-demand service VOD, the most passionate fans will always look to the channel for something exclusive or unexpected.

"We are not suggesting all our shows are worth Â£11.99 a month, only that they should be."

Last year, as the BBC began running the first eight Doctor Who stories, there were just under two million adults who had watched it on BBC iPlayer.

By the end of the year, this number had doubled and there were 3.3 million adults who had watched it each week.

Its UK online audience rose 13% to 616,000 in the year to 14 July.
