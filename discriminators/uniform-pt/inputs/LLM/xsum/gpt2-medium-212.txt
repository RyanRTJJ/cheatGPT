 the heat of battle with the other drivers, so the likes of Sebastian Vettel (Hamilton-Ferrari's first victory of the season), Jenson Button (Mercedes), Felipe Massa (Red Bull) and even Valtteri Bottas (Williams) have to defend their title.

I certainly couldn't have dreamt it!

I will be racing Ferrari at least twice this year if my season goes off without a hitch. I expect the team to start the first of the 2017 season well-prepared for this race and hopefully manage to win at least one race this season!

My personal prediction:

In the world's premiere Grand Prix, Mercedes will definitely win the Australian title this time out!

It's been one of those fantastic streaks where a great team (Mercedes) can keep going strong despite having their own issues. The best teams have worked together and together they've managed to get the most out of every single result. The team just seems to have just clicked off its heels during the 2015 and 2016 season and they have now shown their true colours to the Australian public.

If we see more of this consistent strategy from the team and a lot more consistency this season then I think Mercedes will be in the title hunt at the end of the year.

There are few better times to be a driver for Ferrari â€“ both of these years, both of the races I've worked in, my heart goes out to them both!!! This summer with more of the team's financial resources being invested in a great season of racing (well, technically not racing, the real season) than ever before, I can't wait for them to kick off their 2017 as much as I wish for them to.

Happy racing everyone!!!
