The rate of adult physical activity was higher in the UK than other nations around the world. For instance, in Norway (37%), the USA (31%), France (29%) and New Zealand (27%) adults took part in 150 minute of physical activity each week.

The analysis found that those living in the largest cities – with 10 million or more people in them – were most likely to be physically active, compared with those living in smaller settlements.

There was a higher percentage of people walking to work, walking to shopping areas in urban centres and walking to a particular place to go from school, gym or home.

Of those who had been walking, only 22% had skipped a day of walking at least once.

More than half of men in the UK who admitted to skipping a day on a walk were women. About half of the women who admitted to being physically inactive at the study time were living in cities.

While almost half of US men and women in the study had walked around once in the last week, most of these were walking to work (49%) or home in the previous week (54%).

More than one-in-four of participants living in smaller communities reported not exercise outdoors.

Nearly four-in-ten residents in urban centres (37%) had been walking in the previous day, compared with only 26% in rural areas.

The findings come from the 2017 WHO global study on physical activity participation and outcomes that included more than 10,000 adults across 43 countries.

'This research confirms what we all know in our own hearts and our own local communities and that all people want to improve their health and wellbeing,' said Dr Sinead O'Donnell, co-author of the study and project manager for WHO's Exercise to Health (E2H) campaign.

'These findings should be reassuring to people living in urban areas who want to remain active but who may
