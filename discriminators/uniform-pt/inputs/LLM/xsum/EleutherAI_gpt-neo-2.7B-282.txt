25 aircraft is now being inspected for any problems.

If the inspections come up clean, the plane was scheduled to make a round-trip non-stop flight to India on July 10. However, the flight was cancelled after the French government issued a travel advisory against Indian passenger Airlines after the incident.

The director of the French civil aviation department, Gilles Peillon, said: "In the event the H25 aircraft was found to be at fault, the plane would have been grounded. We have made sure the necessary equipment is in the plane to check it on a daily basis since last month."

The plane was being operated by a French subsidiary of British Airways. According to data released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), since the incident French flights have been suspended by almost two-thirds of the carrier's weekly schedules, totalling about 16 per cent during this week alone.

The suspension affects many European, Italian and Middle Eastern airlines as well as flights from Scandinavia.

"This is very worrying because Indian air traffic is growing, not decreasing," Puneet Jha, an analyst, said after the incident. "India is our biggest market."

The passengers on the H25 flight were stranded in Colombo until July 16 evening after they boarded the ill-fated flight on Friday from Paris. "I had to cancel my trip on July 10 for health reasons. This has made things quite difficult for the family and relatives," a family member said.

The British Airways aircraft took off at around 11pm (9pm EDT) after more than 300 passengers were onboard its flight EC-330. They were about to fly to Mumbai for the annual Indian Air Force day celebrations. Only about 100 or so passengers were ready to take-off when the crew on board began using the toilets late night.

The captain on board suddenly made a distress call to the Airbus to ground the aircraft around 1am the following day. The crew took off later to return to Colombo, which was a 2 hour-27 minute flight. On landing, the aircraft's flaps and slats were opened because of low visibility and it was too dark to make a landing at night
