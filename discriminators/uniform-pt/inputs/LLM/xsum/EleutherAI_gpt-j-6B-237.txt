 cyber-espionage was raised at the talks with Washington.

'The most important'

"It was really helpful," Mr Hagel said after the meeting. "It was the most important issue."

The Pentagon said cyber security "continues to be a challenge for many nations".

Hackers broke into the personal email accounts of the email's owner, the BBC's John Simpson in the UK, when he was writing the original broadcast.

But the head of the US cyber command said the United States was not targeting Chinese institutions or companies.

It can't be known what is being done by hackers of the US Department of Defence

"Our strategy towards the cyber arena, in the cyber world, remains as we've always had," Navy Admiral Robert Kehler said. "The same five tenets of operational security, and, frankly, I think that's what gives us an edge.

"We don't seek to achieve supremacy, but we're always looking for an advantage."

He went on to defend the US practice of using viruses to attack machines of "nations that are considered to be adversaries, for example, from Russia and China - or nations that are considered to be enemies of the United States".

He went on to reject the idea that the hacking was an attempt to sway a US election.

"We have nothing that would suggest or infer we are seeking to do that," he said. "It can't be known what is being done by hackers of the US Department of Defence."

The Pentagon said the US-China summit included a "robust exchange of views" on other topics including counter-terrorism and arms control.

It has asked Beijing to stop hacking US government computer networks and demanded that Beijing end cyber attacks against private US companies.

During the talks, Mr Hagel also agreed to set up a so-called cyberspace dialogue with China to talk about "cyber-related issues".
