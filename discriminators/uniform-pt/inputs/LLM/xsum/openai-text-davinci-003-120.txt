 staff were attacked, and condemned the disorder.

Avon and Somerset Police, who were heavily criticised for failing to prevent violence, said they arrested people at the ground, on the journey to Bristol, and in the city following their investigations into some of the "shocking" scenes on Sunday.

Away supporters, both Rangers fans and others, came under fire in an official HMFC statement on Sunday evening.

It said: "Rangers are disgusted by the conduct of a number of fans who engaged in criminal activity following yesterday’s match against Bristol City at Ashton Gate.

“We unreservedly condemn their behaviour and are working closely with Bristol City Football Club and the police in dealing with this matter.

“Rangers are aware of the scenes outside the ground after the game, with a number of supporters being attacked, both by other Rangers fans and by attendees from other clubs.

"Rangers players and staff were also involved in physical and verbal attacks as they were leaving the ground.

“We will be taking the strongest possible action against those individuals found to be responsible for these acts of criminality or causing any unsavoury scenes of disorder.

“We will also be working with Bristol City, the Football Association, and the police to ensure that those responsible are identified and dealt with in the correct way.”

Avon and Somerset Police confirmed that 15 people had so far been arrested or reported to the Crown Prosecution Service in connection with the disorder.

In a statement, Chief Inspector Phil Samuels said: "We’re continuing to investigate the significant disorder that occurred in Bristol on Sunday as a result of the Bristol City v Rangers match at Ashton Gate.
