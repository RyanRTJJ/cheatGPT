g £70,000 from vulnerable people with learning disabilities, as well as her own six children from whom she withheld toiletries, proper clothing and toys.

The court heard that she took the money from four individuals whom she had befriended and then exploited by taking over the running of their finances, beginning in 2007. She used the money to fund her own extravagant lifestyle. In addition to this, she failed to provide adequate care and support for her children who lived in squalid conditions in their home. 

The judge condemned her actions as “despicable, callous and shameful”, citing that she had neglected her responsibility as a parent. The judge went on to commend the vulnerability of her victims and the testimony from her own children which highlighted the trauma of the situation. The mother has shown no remorse for her actions and was described as a “serial fraudster and a bully”.

The mother will serve her sentence in a correctional facility, where she will have to complete a financial abuse awareness course. She will also be subject to a Serious Crime Prevention Order which will restrict her access to vulnerable people when she is eventually released.  The order is designed to reduce the likelihood of her re-offending. 

This case is the latest example of financial abuse and the terrible consequences it can have on the victims and their families. It serves as a reminder to be aware of the risks of financial exploitation, and to be alert to any signs of abuse, no matter how insignificant they may seem.
