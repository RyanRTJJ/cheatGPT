 needed to meet a set of criteria to be considered for conversion.

Staff decided to launch the appeal to cover "a very good cause" after one of the hospital's wards was closed and some of its junior doctors were made redundant.

"It would just be a shame if something good didn't happen in our hospital" said a nurse.

An NHS England staff representative said that the decision to close the hospitals was made by a private healthcare company which the NHS took over and that the only financial obligation to NHS England was a payment of Â£5,500 towards the conversion work.

NHTV and Birmingham Children's Hospitals NHS trust have been working with NHS England to try and ensure that the hospital receives NHS funding in some shape or form for the future. For example the hospital still has use of the NHS name.

A spokesperson for The Queen Elizabeth Hospital said that they were aware of the campaign, but had taken no part in it.

The Queen Elizabeth Hospital is likely to find itself with a tough decision over its future. It is currently under the umbrella of the NHS but it will transition to becoming a private company in January 2019.

According to the Department of Health a list of NHS trusts will be published in 2020. It is estimated they will make a decision over the future of the hospital by 2023.

A spokesperson for Birmingham Children's Hospital confirmed talks were under way between the trust and NHS England and the hospital was awaiting a final decision.
