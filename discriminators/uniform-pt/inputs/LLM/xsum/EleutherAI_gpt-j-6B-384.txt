 the proposal at the end of September, ruling it would be incompatible with current plans for a “master development” on the site.

Although Abergavenny was declared by ministers to be a world-class destination in a May 2016 press release, it is not yet able to attract visitors to the scale anticipated as it has a population of around 15,000 people, and an average wage of only £15,000.

Kalm, which runs a number of tourist attractions in the town, says it is planning a large, multi-million-pound operation to boost Abergavenny's tourist industry.

A group called Abergavenny Local Enterprise Partnership (Ablep) was set up in July for that purpose. It claims to represent the interests of 1,500 businesses in the town.

But local Liberal Democrat councillors have challenged Ablep's right to represent all of the town's commercial community in the name of localism.

A report to the county council’s executive – due to be discussed in public for the first time on June 21 – states that Ablep is making misleading representations as to Abergavenny’s economy.

They are quoted as saying at the heart of Abergavenny’s future is its “high class visitor experience”, its “beautiful location”, and “the quality of Abergavenny’s historic buildings”, while “Ablep say Abergavenny’s economy is driven by business for business visitors.”

And even though Abergavenny has a population of fewer than 16,000 people and an unemployment rate of 5.5 per cent compared with the national level of 8.1 per cent, the “average weekly wage” of £15,000 is well below that of other local authorities, the report states.

It says that if the market is “forced to a compulsory sale on a market site, this would mean the town's economy would be destroyed and would be in the wrong place.”

On June 5, a planning inspector ruled in favour of Ablep and recommended that the county council’s executive approves a development consent order for Able
