 "against poverty, ignorance and disease." As the original title suggests it also works to promote human kindness (Chiaradonati, 2014). I do not think that the Order of Malta has direct interests or links with the Order of the Temple or Knights Templar.

The Order of Malta 
A list of the Knights Hospitaller is not available for the year 1125 when the Order was founded, as this was the year in which the first Pope, Lucius III, died and was succeeded by Calixtus III (S.D. 536). One of the reasons for that is that Pope Urban II who created the Knights Hospitaller of the Order of St. John is often considered to be the same person as the Pope, for historians often confuse the two. The Order was originally named the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem in Jerusalem and the Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem. The order was founded because of the crusades by Pope Urban II who sent the knights to take back Jerusalem from the Muslims, who had destroyed it.

The Order had a complex organisation structure with chapters and grand master. The Order went through a long period of decline and disorganisation after the Order was disbanded by Pope Alexander III. It was finally revived by Pope Sixtus V. There were knights in the Order from many parts of Europe, although the majority were British knights. From Britain, they came from Cornwall, Devon, Devon (Abergavenny), and Wales. In 1284 some of these knights met and agreed upon a set of rules which would allow them to act as a self governing institution independent of the Pope. These knights were not affiliated with the Catholic Church. In 1349, Pope Clement VII issued a ban on the order. It was not until 1380 that Pope John XXII issued a permit for the knights to gather in their own chapter houses.
