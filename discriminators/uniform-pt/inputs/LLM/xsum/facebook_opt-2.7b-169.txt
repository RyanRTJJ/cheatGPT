 mild symptoms for most, but it is especially dangerous for babies and women with other health problems.

But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday evening itâ€™s looking into an outbreak of Zika virus in the southern region of Florida.

It said it is investigating a cluster of 49 infections in Monroe County as well as the two cases it had previously confirmed in Brevard County.

As of Oct. 1, there have been a total of 19 locally spread infections in Florida.

Health officials are still awaiting results on a Zika case that the CDC detected in Broward County two weeks ago. It is undergoing laboratory tests and it is unclear if the person infected is a local or local travel.

The Florida Department of Health said there are no travel restrictions in place. The two infected in Brevard County and Broward County were exposed while in Miami.

The Health Department urged anyone who traveled to the region between July 1 and Aug. 31 to get tested if they have signs of Zika. Those who believe they may have been exposed should contact their health care provider.

A Zika outbreak in Brazil in two parts of the state of Pernambuco has caused four deaths. The virus could potentially move from one locale to another in the US, with transmission via an infected mosquito.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the Zika virus is believed to have been linked to only a handful of cases in the US so far despite an increase in people entering the country since the outbreak started late last year.

Travelers should be vigilant about getting rid of standing water in their homes to avoid mosquito bites.

While Zika is a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted to people, the CDC states local mosquitoes have not infected people who live in communities in the US. In addition, there are no cases of Zika being spread by people to people in the US at this time.

But, Florida may well become the first place in America to see spread of the virus from local mosquitoes. That would be a big step on the heels of Zika cases in Mexico, according to the World Health Organization.
