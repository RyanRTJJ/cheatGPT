, which is now defunct, also built the Halifax and Halifax Southern ferries.

'Biggest failure'

Innes, who never faced a conviction for any crime related to the Halifax ferries as a sailor, took a job as superintendent in Halifax while serving as chair of the Nova Scotia Maritime Association before his fall, a spokesperson for the RCMP says.

"He's the biggest failure that ever happened," said RCMP Superintendent Frank Vigneault. "I think you can judge us as we're looking at what happened and he's a person who we're saying needs to face the music and be held accountable for his actions."

Vigneault would not comment specifically on whether there has been a police investigation in the matter yet, but did say the RCMP is focusing on determining who leaked the information about the Halifax ferry company to the media.

Higgins was released without bail on Nov. 7. He is scheduled to appear in Nova Scotia court on Jan. 10.

Innes made no comment when reached by CBC News on Thursday evening.

At the time of the bridge's sinking, the company was in the midst of a massive expansion effort, said Vigneault, the RCMP officer.

"As the company was constructing the construction of the bridge all along the lines of where they were able to build the bridge, they were looking at different locations around Canada. From what we know, this information was coming from a person connected to the company. In some aspects it was leaked to the media."

One shipmate on the bridge when the ferries sank is awaiting compensation

Another of the ship's victims is also awaiting full compensation, one of the shipmates who died in the disaster is seeking compensation under a separate policy, the union representing ferry workers said in December.

An internal investigation into the sinking of the ferry, conducted by Halifax Transit and Halifax Harbour Authority, found that engineering personnel at the time failed to perform a "comprehensive" investigation and follow up on "substantial concerns" raised about the vessel's safety by employees.
