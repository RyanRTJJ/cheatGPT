enta all cutting staff, and the loss of many jobs in the sector.

In a video shot shortly after the meeting, Monsanto vice-president Tom Williams told employees on the video that their job is “critical to solving world hunger because you are helping to make this more profitable for the farmers.”

The company also told employees they were encouraged to get involved with the company’s mission.

“I’m encouraged by the openness and spirit of this company with employees. We’ve got to take the attitude that I think it’s incumbent on every organization to make the most of every opportunity presented to them,” Williams said.

For its part, DuPont last week announced the creation of 3,000 new jobs to be created in its corporate offices in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

In the same vein, Syngenta, which announced plans for a $1.35bn (£1bn) buyback of its shares in 2017, has seen its sales drop, its net income soar and the number of people it employs rise from around 80,000 to around 400,000 over the past eight years. Earlier this month, the company announced it is seeking to appoint a new chief executive to replace Walter Starck, who stood down last year after four years in the job.

The company’s move to appoint a chief operating officer is to take aim at “the old way of doing things” and is another sign that it is trying to streamline and focus more on commercial opportunities, which had led to high staff turnover on its North American chemical business over the past few years.

In other companies, the pressure to improve bottom lines led to turnover, including in Monsanto, which has seen sales fall sharply over the past decade following an activist campaign.

Reuters reported last week that the company’s new chief executive, Hugh Grant, is planning to eliminate about 200 jobs.
