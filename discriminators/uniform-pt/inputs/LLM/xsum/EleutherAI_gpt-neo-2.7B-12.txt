The draft legislation, known as the Communications Act, says it intends to provide “a law which will stop the spread of malicious messages, as well as the incitement to violence, hatred and violence against communities and the public in general”.

“The Act aims to protect civil society and the free flow of information and other forms of communication in the country,” the draft reads.

On Friday, Canada’s national opposition parties had an opportunity to introduce amendments to the bill, but the government rejected them. It’s unclear whether they will be debated on Tuesday.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Conservative government has been at loggerheads with social media firms like Facebook, Twitter and Google over claims of biased and problematic content on their platforms. (The government has also asked Facebook to do more to monitor hate speech.)

In February, Twitter and Google Canada said they are working with the Canadian government to make improvements to the reporting system for inappropriate content. In February, the Prime Minister’s Office asked the companies to do even more with the voluntary measures and a government report of social media companies by end of the year.

But now that some of those measures have passed the Senate—and more appear likely to in the coming months—the government is calling upon the companies to make further moves.

In June, following a report on the government’s request for the companies to do more, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council recommended more changes to how content is reported to law enforcement. But those proposals have yet to come up with the telecoms.

“It would be wonderful if the companies took our suggestions to heart,” said Conservative MP Andrew Leslie.

The draft legislation is also set to pass through a crucial round of consultations with Canadians on how its recommendations should be implemented.

The bill will then go to the House of Commons, where it could be debated by Parliament’s Speaker, House of Commons.
