 the drive to work in less than 20 percent of the cars they drive.

"This new drive to work is one of the most important changes to our transport system and we know a little about the future of cars," says Tim MacLure, former CEO of the Car Industry Association. "In order for car consumption to go to a healthy level it takes decades to reach 80 per cent of the population.

"However, that figure is still a small percentage of the population."

McLure is warning that even if everyone in the UK takes part in driving, in addition to the car, it will cost $14 billion per year – which is just over half of current-day consumer spending.

"But the benefits are really substantial, so it's very important people take the chance," he says.

"But as it happens people will also drive more heavily."

It is not the only car industry which is losing its way, with the Toyota Motor Research Council also finding that the price of a new car is going up, which in turn means an increase in car prices.

"Research for Toyota suggests that drivers are paying up to $50 per kilo more, with these pricing increases likely to push more car owners out of London," says the council.

"But it's not clear if this will have any significant impact on fuel prices."

Car dealers are already charging more to use petrol, which is a more convenient and cost-effective option. Many buyers prefer to use cheaper fuel and will use regular fuel, with it lower emissions than the gas.

Other consumers also have begun to take the opportunity: a car dealer in Liverpool paid the amount of 10 extra kilonears worth of gas needed to use one extra wheel.

Despite the low price of petrol as a whole, these are still being bought by just a small minority of people in central London and Birmingham, which are on average £10 higher than the national average.

Dr Richard Pate, lecturer in automotive research at Leeds University in the UK argues that even for those in some areas already driving regularly the driving cost could rise, with driving a driver likely
