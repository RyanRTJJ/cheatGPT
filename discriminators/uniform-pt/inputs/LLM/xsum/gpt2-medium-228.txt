 still much doubt as to whether the disease is due to a virus at all or a fungal disease in which bacteria, such as fungal infections of milk or meat, invade the gut.

However, there are several vaccines against fungal infections, and Gow believed the next generation could be better than the current list.

"Some countries have better vaccination rates with specific vaccines like pertussis and rotavirus and some countries do better immunisation with all vaccines, but we can't know because we don't know what goes on in the gut."

Gow called on more researchers to look at gut bacteria to pinpoint where the cause of fungal infections occurs. For example, one study revealed it occurs in parts of Japan, Turkey and Sri Lanka. However, there are still questions around what the bacteria do in human bodies and what specific conditions may be associated with it.

Gow also thought the lack of an effective vaccine was something to consider. "My guess is there might be some very powerful immune response with infections which we don't know. Maybe a combination of vaccines could help."

Gow said it would be very nice if scientists had started studying fungal infections in patients in order to find a better vaccine. "There could be an issue with those on intensive support, or if you started trying to treat them with a more specific vaccine."

Mental health consultant Dr James Leys from the University of Melbourne in Australia, agrees that there may be an underlying issue with mental illness.

"More evidence is needed to demonstrate whether the gut microbiome plays a role in the development of mental illness. Hopefully we know something because it's a very intriguing idea from the outside."

It is not surprising that one reason why so few people have had a cure for fungal infections is because it is not something that has been treated previously through vaccination.

Leys, whose own son has a mild form of fungal infection known as acute gastroesophageal reflux disease (AFPD), a severe and often fatal condition, said he does not believe
