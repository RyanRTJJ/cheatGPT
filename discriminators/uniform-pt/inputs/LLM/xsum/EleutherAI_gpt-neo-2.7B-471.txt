Mr Fink's conviction came after the State Government, under pressure from Labor, forced two banks to repay $160,000 to an Australian-based company in respect of a loan to the company.

State Labor announced the repayment on Thursday.

The State Government says the repayment on behalf of the State Bank of TAS was necessary due to the financial emergency created by the company's failure under the Commonwealth-administered scheme in 2007.

The company was only the third company from the Northern Territory to be allowed to remain open under the scheme in 2000.

State Labor says it has raised the repayment for other banks in the Territory through various avenues with the Australian Bankers Association, the Association for Financial Compensation Services and the Attorney-General's Chambers.

"The repayment we are making today, $160,000, is for loans made to the Northern Territory-administered scheme, the Commonwealth-administered scheme and the Northern Territory-administered scheme."

In relation to Mr Fink, a police spokeswoman said he had entered guilty pleas to both charges on Wednesday.

His guilty plea on Wednesday does not preclude the State Government seeking a custodial sentence under the Act, a spokesman for the Attorney-General's Department said.
