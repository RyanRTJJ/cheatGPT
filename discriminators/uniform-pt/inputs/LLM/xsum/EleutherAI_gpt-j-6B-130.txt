 day and, more worrisome for law enforcement officers and lawmakers, the rising number of reported incidents is increasing.

The government may be taking it more seriously, too. The Israeli prime minister’s office is in the process of creating the National Drone Advisory Committee to give police, border guards, and other enforcement agencies the expertise needed to manage UAVs.

The government also wants to impose some specific rules regarding drone use. The law would require drone owners to register with the government and would require them to disclose information about any operation in an emergency. Operators would also be subject to liability if they fail to safely transport the UAV, or if they use the vehicle to spy on someone, such as a politician or a terrorist.

Some legislators want to limit use of these devices. A draft law introduced into Israel’s parliament last week would make it illegal to use an unmanned aircraft in a military or security mission if the operator is outside Israel or if the aircraft’s flight is unapproved for its intended purpose or area. The law also proposes to subject the operators to a heavy fine or imprisonment if a UAV “fails to complete a given mission or is used improperly.”

Some advocates warn that the drone regulations in Israel should not be adopted in the United States: “Israel’s law has led to the kind of extreme overreaction that threatens our freedom to use drones in America,” says Jay Stanley, an American Civil Liberties Union privacy expert. He argues that this draft law is too broad and will “inflate the risk and inconvenience of drone use far beyond what is warranted.”
