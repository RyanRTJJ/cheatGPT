 adopt a diet high in fibre from maize, cassava and other grains.

The switch to low-fat diets significantly reduced fat in blood, liver and spleen, and reduced fat in the liver and spleen area, and lower body weight.

The results of the study suggest diets of this food type may have benefits for the liver, spleen and muscle as well, while high-fibre diets increased body weight despite reduced fat in blood.

In rural African populations, diets higher in fibre tended to have a favourable effect on the spleen, spleens and hepatic fat content during the study.

The study was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

"The dietary interventions produced the greatest effects on cholesterol levels in the liver and spleen," the lead author Dr Thomas O'Brien from the Department of Nutrition Sciences at the University College Cork said.

"This provides a further reason that diets higher in fibre can have beneficial effects on health."

The amount of cholesterol the body has is influenced by numerous factors, including diet, exercise, hormonal levels and disease.

"Although the overall intake of cholesterol is important, the effect of diet is clearly important on cholesterol levels," she said. "The findings of this study add to the body of evidence showing that fibre intake contributes to our overall wellbeing through the liver, spleen and the spleen's role in cholesterol metabolism."

She added that other researchers should consider including a fibre supplementation to help people with conditions like diabetes or cholesterol problems.

This may help to normalise low LDL cholesterol levels.

Earlier this year, doctors at the University College Cork and the Irish National Institute of Health and Welfare investigated the effect of a dietary regimen high in fibre on the health of older adults.

This study, which explored the effect of dietary fibre on blood cholesterol levels of healthy people 80 and over, concluded the dietary fibre led to the reduction of blood cholesterol.

Prof. Colm O'Sullivan, an emeritus professor of medicine at the University College Cork, noted that for many of the results of this study it was
