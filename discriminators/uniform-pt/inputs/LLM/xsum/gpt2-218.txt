 patients. Patients must be referred for further consultation.

According to the DfE report, "in the next 10 years patients in the programme will be able to receive kidney dialysis in large numbers and will be able to benefit from the cost of dialysis, including the reduced cost of dialysis due to reductions in costs as well as lower costs of waiting time.

"This will make it possible for patients to reduce their use of dialysis through better care and treatment of their problems. Other improvements to the program could help in this regard" that would be "more suitable for use in patients with renal problems, and other conditions where a reduced use of dialysis may be important and associated with long term complications."

When the plan was announced the CEO of the Department said "it is a huge win for the kidneys of the community and a huge credit to the NHS".

More than 100,000 people around the world now rely on dialysis and kidney technology to treat hundreds of thousands of diseases.

The latest research suggests the benefits of dialysis from low sugar is even greater because "this is likely to reduce the need for unnecessary surgery and even reduce the cost of dialysis".

It said that patients suffering from kidney disease "remain highly optimistic about the long term benefits" of dialysis.

The latest research has also indicated that only 5% of UK patients in the kidney disease programme end up on low sugar diets. A total of 31,000 of the 31,000 that end up on low sugar diets received dialysis surgery.

Dr Cresswell admitted the trial was "somewhat of a disappointment", adding that his patients "were very happy with the outcomes".

The DfE reported last month that over a third of these patients also had diabetes, while nearly a quarter of those using high-calcium diets are on sugar diets.

The DfE said that it will now look at the impact of changes in the diet as well as on the overall health of the population.

David Denton, chief executive of the UK government's national health service, said the DfE "seemingly needs to take action to better manage our public health problems".
