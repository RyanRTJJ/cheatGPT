 interesting to note that the Belgian government itself will also introduce same-sex marriage this year, although this law is pending a court ruling for whether it may be considered legally valid.

The law was passed with the approval of parliament but it still needs to be ratified by the lower house.

The Belgian lawmakers, who passed the bill in a 5-4 vote, debated several different scenarios, including legal age, before passing the bill. Under the final law, the age of consent will be lowered, but the actual age of maturity will be kept at 16.

Despite the fact that Belgium already has a similar law on criminal liability for pedophilia, the vote to remove the age limit from the country’s legal code was needed because it was thought that such a law needed to be amended to better align international standards on child protection. The law will, thus, take effect “in a year’s time,” according to the Belgian magazine Het Nieuwsblad.

A debate on the legal age of consent was a long one throughout Belgium because different opinions have long existed on how the age should be decided. As a result, Belgium’s parliament has debated the legal age of consent of consent more than 10 times in the past. In 2004, the upper House, the Senate, passed a law that lowered the legal age of consent to 15. However, the parliament failed to meet its goal because of a huge backlash from people who argued that raising the legal age of consent would not be good for the well-being of minors and also that the law unfairly discriminated against those who are over 18, as older people tend to abuse their positions of power and take advantage of minors they’re attracted to.

The controversy on the legal age of consent got as big as the case of Joran van Dijken, one of the subjects of “Finding Nemo”
