 to extend to 70 from the current 1,000."We have to look at that and decide our next steps. The future now depends on how we continue to invest" Mr Trenberth said.

He said a host of factors could play out, including changes in the legislation on business entities and other matters. To date there have been no complaints about the AM program being over budget or "unworkable", the legislation said.

A recent government-commissioned study found that AMs are more efficient than others, which could be due to different government regulations and regulations than the government's.

The Government, Labor, Social Democrats and Greens had already voted against giving them any of five AMs.

"While we agree with the Government's decision to extend the AM program," Labor MP Anthony Albanese's statement said, "it is clear that it should be extended just three more years while those on our block are still too busy to get their heads around the fact that in some countries the government will decide how many AMs to put in as a cost-cutting measure in order to prevent budget deficits from exceeding $1bn.

"There will no doubt be a series of budget impositions that will push further spending further into line with the national interest.

"The most likely outcome however would be that a further delay in this new policy would bring a major price to be paid if AM policy continued."

"I am convinced the Government had hoped to support the government's request for longer but had to give up as well in a manner that further delayed the project is unlikely to succeed."
