 Serbian goalkeeper saved a header from David Di Renna and saved the rebound from substitute Adrien Rabiot in the 62nd minute to deny the French international a stoppage time winner.

The match was interrupted for 90 seconds when a mass of players stormed the pitch following a second yellow card to former Paris Saint-Germain youth player Maximilian Togliatti. A group of shirtless fans, including a number of Serbian players, were heard singing about the former Lyon star. The situation was broken up by referee Christophe Lollichon with one of his assistants.

The Serbian players returned to the pitch and their first act was to walk in place, hands in pockets, in protest to the behavior of the fans.

After the match, Novakovic criticized the behavior of the opposing supporters on his Facebook page. “The opposition fans are like a swarm of locusts which come to bite your fingers whenever you touch the ball. They come to bite even with your hands down because they can’t even touch the ball. This happens all the time in games, but they really did it in this match,” wrote Novakovic.

Parma coach Roberto Mancosu said following the game that he couldn’t understand the reasoning behind the violence. “Nobody likes to see the opposition fans behave in such a way that we can’t play football with our shirts,” he said during his press conference. “So, for me, it was not really bad, it was a bit sad. It was a sad match, so it was natural.”

Following the match, Parma confirmed that they will not have him back for next year’s Champions League due to his disciplinary infraction.

After three days of injury to Parma’s key personnel, Milan manager Vranjkanin, who is in charge of the first leg, had said that he wouldn’t risk his team’s European hopes for his second string starting XI. After missing Parma’s top attackers, it was also announced that Daniele Bonera, who was expected to play in Milan’s game as a substitute, would not be back for the second leg.
