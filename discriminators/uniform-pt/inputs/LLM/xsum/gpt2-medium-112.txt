 guidelines for patient safety and patient consent.

"It would be in the best interests of patients to have the time to make themselves aware of the change," she said.

The Royal College of Surgeons would also stop the NHS charity providing free health assessments for patients under 18 when they go to appointments from Monday.

"This includes free health examinations when attending appointments. The NHS wants to hear from people in this age group on what they are interested in â€“ whether it is family medical or a longer term programme," said Clare Lawless, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Surgeons.

While the charity would also start making available a separate appointment for patients with special medical needs, any such appointments would remain free at their standard rates.

A spokeswoman for the British Paediatric Society added: "In addition to our current consultation, the Society will consider new guidelines for child and adolescent health assessment, where appropriate. The time of the consultation, as well as a range of practical suggestions for this consultation, will be communicated in the near future."

Ms Lamb and Mr Jones said they had had no plans to switch over to the new service from Friday.

"We feel as though it isn't as fair as it could be when it comes to access to health services," they said.

"It's a terrible thing, but to me it just feels like people are getting worse and worse with age.

"We feel like if we did switch over, it's an easier way for us to keep us informed as part of the NHS."

A spokeswoman at the Royal College of Surgeons said that its approach was unique and would be determined as "health problems evolve over time".

She added: "We would hope that those with an individual health condition who require support and support from these kinds of schemes would feel as though this would enable them to be better informed."
