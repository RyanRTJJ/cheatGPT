Plans for the new St Nicholas development

Plans for new homes in St. Nicholas area

A proposal for new homes to replace former St. Nicholas’ school

In February 2014, the University of Bath’s Council had received an application for new houses to replace the dilapidated former St. Nicholas school. Since then, the application has been sent to the Local Planning Authority (‘the LPA’), and the application has been reviewed by the St. Nicholas Community Forum and the Architectural Review Board. The LPA has confirmed the proposed development in their first approval for the new development. The University will provide approximately 10% affordable housing. The scheme is for approximately 60 homes.

The University’s new College (now Bath Spa University's Bath campus) now has a proposal pending for a five acre site just to the north of our present campus. This will provide some additional classroom capacity when additional campus buildings are created, and will further develop the close relationship with the City which has resulted in our increasing use of the Westfield site to the South.

The building proposals are not currently known. It is widely expected that the new College, and the new housing (and retail) development will be built along the A4/N7. The area has been designated under the ‘St Nicholas Village’ planning policy as a residential development.

A revised layout shows the new development

Muse Developments have prepared site and planning advice for the University on this new site, to give the University, Planning authority and our other stakeholders a comprehensive overview of the site. This will help the University plan with the right layout for the new housing and their facilities. It will enable us to provide all the necessary services on site for the staff and students, and
