 the case over to other authorities, so that they can complete their work" it says, referring to Swiss Federal authorities.

Sweden will conduct an independent review of the allegations, the organisation said, adding that the club "should be free to conduct its own internal inquiry".

The criminal investigation, conducted "closely with the cooperation of Fifa" centres around the purchase of young players.

Fifa says it will "not be issuing further details given that the legal investigation is being conducted by the appropriate authorities".

What are the allegations?

Sweden's Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Local cited the confidential document leaked by US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden.

The document reportedly describes an alleged "large-scale operation" that involved the corruption of senior executives in order to obtain the transfer of "at least $150m (£91m) of Fifa World Cup marketing and broadcast rights".

According to Süddeutsche Zeitung's English-language website, the allegations relate to the bidding process for the 2006-2018 World Cup in Zurich in 2006, including the "arrangement of payments to Fifa, marketing companies and commercial partners, in return for the granting and extension of voting rights for media organisations."

It reports that a high-ranking source from Fifa told the paper: "In 2006 it looked like there was a huge conflict of interest, on the way the best World Cup ever took place. Even though the world governing body had no idea that they are selling tickets and World Cup sponsors and broadcasters.

"It was only when the World Cup was won by Korea/Japan because South Korea is the biggest market, that they started getting calls from other sponsors.

"That was also when the investigation began in 2009. That's when they know the facts they don't let it lie."

What Fifa is saying

"Fifa expresses its deep regret that serious allegations of financial irregularities have surfaced against Fifa," it told BBC Sport.

"It is absolutely crucial that these allegations are properly investigated by the authorities to ensure the necessary legal process is carried out."
