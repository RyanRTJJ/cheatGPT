2 hours a week without taking unpaid breaks, and only 12.4 hours with unpaid breaks.

This makes it impossible for teachers to spend two hours a week, or a year, with their families. To put it in perspective, US President Donald Trump spent 25% more time playing golf than he did with his family. Teachers' lack of time to spend with their families is one of the causes identified in the report as an obstacle to teacher professionalism. The EIS said the results meant that there were just 10.5 hours of teaching time to do everything that teachers are expected to do.

The EIS estimates that in 2012-13 there were 2,200 full-time equivalent teachers being assigned to support each student. The report said this meant that each teacher is needed to spend 10.5 hours a week in direct engagement and supervision and to spend an additional 12.4 hours a week on supporting roles and time not spent directly on a child. However, it says this can't be reasonably expected. As part of this, the report says that the teaching week is already extended and that this week is not paid.

The report also found that the extra support hours do not contribute to teaching, with the report saying that "In the academic year 2012-13, only 0.2 hours was spent on additional support for studentsâ€™ progress when an hour of teaching was spent directly with a student."

As part of the report, the EIS said that schools could be doing more to reduce the number of hours that teachers spend on teaching. The report says that school leaders have a huge effect on the time teachers spend on teaching, saying that the average teacher spends one third of their working week on teaching, despite the average time teachers spend at school at only 45 minutes.

The report said that there is great variation in the number of teaching hours and that this variation is increasing. The report said that this trend is at odds with the target in
