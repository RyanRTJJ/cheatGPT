However, there is still room for further falls to come.

According to the data from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), people were in work on average for one year for every five in the job market.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also reported that there were 45,300 workers who were "not in work" - meaning they were either in part-time work, unemployed or neither in the labour market.

It said this was the highest level since 1998 and meant the UK had seen 45,100 fewer people in work than five years previously.

The number of people out of work more than halved in the last 20 years, and has been holding at between 50,000 and 55,000.

The ONS also reported a 1.4% reduction in the number of people working part-time, compared to last year.

This is a tough measure to put in context.

The UK economy should be in recovery mode from its weak start in 2012.

There are plenty of signs of that. Since February, employment has increased by more than 200,000, driven by a record surge in self-employment. The unemployment rate has fallen sharply.

Those trends suggest the government has made big strides in the economy, with its recovery continuing to be robust.

But it's the number of people who are working but looking for a job and want to be part of the labour market that looks troubling.

That figure has nearly halved from 45,000 to 28,000.

That is the kind of data that will worry the chancellor, George Osborne, at a time when his department needs a renewed dose of economic credibility after its failure to prevent Britain going into recession in the last quarter of 2012.
