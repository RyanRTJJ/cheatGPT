Mr Slater was due to start a job as a bricklayer at the University of Bradford, while Ms Slater was on maternity leave after having a child.

They had set off on the five-hour walk at about 9am after going out for a pre-dawn breakfast.

“A search of the area around the Old Man of Hoy yesterday was assisted by coastguards, cliff rescue officers and an RAF helicopter. The location of the pair has not been confirmed.”

An RAF air crew who flew into the area to take images of a steep, rocky area where the men went missing can back an assessment that the pair is alive.
