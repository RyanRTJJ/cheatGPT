 programme launched by Ms Park to kickstart economic growth. It is expected to inject around 150bn won on average each month for the next three months.

Ms Park took office two weeks ago, vowing to drive growth of around 3 percent this year to kick start a sluggish economy.

Analysts say that Ms Park's push to encourage domestic and international investment in South Korea has made the country a potential market for North Korean exports if the North comes to the negotiating table on its nuclear weapons program.

The new package included a "solidarity bond" of 200bn won for cross-border investors, including companies and individuals living in the South, by 2016.

The North Korean delegation, led by its deputy UN ambassador Kim In-ryong, said it had agreed to sign the document to express its support to the South.

"We agreed to sign the relevant documents and declare our firm stance in the future," the delegation said in a statement.

'Cultural exchange'

Analysts say the new package is designed to boost economic ties between South Korea and the North, which has been struggling to recover from the recent collapse of a previous round of UN sanctions.

Analysts say Ms Park also hopes it will help defuse tensions in the region by easing public anger in the South over North Korea's nuclear test and rocket launch.

Ms Park is also hoping the deal will boost the North's reputation in the West, with which it has been at odds for years over Pyongyang's refusal to abandon its nuclear ambitions despite international criticism.


Ms Park stressed it was a humanitarian mission to help the North's people "to regain stability and prosperity as well as to promote exchanges and cultural cooperation".

Mr In-ryong told reporters that the first step of such a programme was to help the North Koreans build economic sectors like mining and construction.
