 no understanding of how they occur, and the drugs that treat them.

He is working on a vaccine being developed by Oxford University and, if he is successful, it could be licensed for use in the US as soon as 2014.

The Oxford-led vaccine works by triggering an immune response to fungus-infected tissues, with the first vaccine given to two groups of people.

"The immune systems of these two groups would then be boosted with the vaccine. The drug may then be given to the other group."

While he accepts that there will be "a risk" that it could cause infection, he said he believes it would pose no increased risk, because the vaccine would be given to the same patients that were infected with the fungal infection.

"But it really makes all the sense in the world. So this is an exciting experiment and a real possibility for the future."

In the US at the moment there are two approved vaccines for tuberculosis (TB).

In theory these could be used to treat the infection that is the trigger for one form of TB called multi-drug resistance TB (MDR) which has a high mortality rate and resistant to most of the antibiotics used to treat the infection.

But there is a high possibility that people may get ill with the side effects of those drugs and become more susceptible to the fungal infection that triggers the TB.

Researchers are working on a vaccine against the common respiratory disease that causes a large number of people to fall ill with the disease that is caused by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans.

The researchers from the Imperial College of London who undertook the trial did not find an increase in the severity of the infection or symptoms of the disease when they used the anti-fungal drug fluconazole in the trial.

But the trial highlighted the importance of early detection, so that patients can be placed on the anti-fungal drugs and in some cases the infection can be avoided.

"A large number are being infected with the fungal infection that is involved
