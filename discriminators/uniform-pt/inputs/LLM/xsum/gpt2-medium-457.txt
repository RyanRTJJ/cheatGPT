 and the Highlands, while FSP, the National Trust for Scotland and TUV are keen to ensure that Scottish institutions are equipped to be efficient, responsible, flexible and independent in times of change. FSP is currently developing a plan to implement new, effective rules to ensure that Scottish agencies become the first of their kind in the UK.

HIE is encouraging Scottish business to consider other employment opportunities, whether in management, finance, accounting or administration positions within the Scottish Enterprise.

John Curtice, Director-General, FSP & Chief Executive said:

"The National Lottery and Northern Ireland-based TUV have been working very hard in partnership with HIE and Scottish Enterprise to make economic growth for Scotland more appealing in times of change. We welcome HMIP with open arms and would welcome greater partnership with the National Lottery; there are clearly growing areas of overlap within the areas of enterprise – it is encouraging we see how much common ground can be found. It's clear that the FSP's investment in our Scottish enterprise sector will help boost the economy, provide high quality jobs, provide tax receipts and foster sustainable growth. We should be doing more for the wider economy, working with the Government to support enterprise in every nation."
