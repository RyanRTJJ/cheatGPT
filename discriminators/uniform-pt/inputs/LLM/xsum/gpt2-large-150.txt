The National Assembly is considering a bill that would criminalize criticism of the government.

An emergency decree by Maduro was approved on Friday. It says "disparaging, denigrating, insulting, ridiculing, or exposing to any unjustified accusation... shall be punishable by imprisonment in the minimum possible term of one to two years."

Critics say the bill will be used by Maduro against protesters, the country's most prominent opposition to the leftist leader and former socialist leader who is in power since 2014. But opposition legislators are united in their opposition to the measure.

The Venezuelan state prosecutor has accused six pro-government groups and a government minister of plotting and conspiring with international terrorist organizations.

The accusation was made Thursday during a hearing that took place under a secrecy order that has been imposed on Venezuela's opposition parties.

The prosecutor's office says the six groups were part of the "Operation Condor" that targeted opposition leaders.

They say the ministers were part of a "constituent assembly" formed in January to install Maduro as president after the presidential elections in December were annulled. Opposition leaders have blamed the opposition for the elections, which were overwhelmingly boycotted by voters. The Supreme Court also suspended the results of the presidential elections.

Venezuelan opposition lawmakers have criticized the government's new legislation that would limit freedoms.

Opposition lawmaker Jesus Torrealba says the new legislation allows government agents to hold people in military facilities without warrants.

Torrealba says the new legislation would be used to "obstruct free expression."

The National Assembly is considering a bill that would punish those who denounce government policies the lawmaker says are "offensive" and "distressing."

The legislation was approved Thursday. It says "disparaging, denigrating, insulting, ridiculing, or exposing to any unjustified accusation... shall be punishable by imprisonment in the minimum possible term of one to two years."
