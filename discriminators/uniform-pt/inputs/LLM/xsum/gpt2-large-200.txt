 and The Guardian claiming that it had shut down illegal online pirated copies, and stated that the decision was made purely based on the legal issues surrounding the films they were making. A statement from The Guardian says that there had been no official announcements about the closure but that it had confirmed to the agency that it was making the move on 30 October and that they had been "inactive". A statement from BBC says that it had "not received any official message, or have any knowledge of the specific action taken".

The story of The Amazing Spider-Man and its piracy has been told many times over the years and the official account of events is also widely available online from various sources. The official statement from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting does not really add much.

The government agency did not mention anything about the size of their action and whether they had targeted the specific download sites that may be responsible but that is what they are generally doing when they have made a statement to a media outlet. We have seen similar cases in the past where governments have used this position as an excuse to continue closing down sites, so it is not surprising at all to this story that it works in another way. As we have seen before, internet pirates and those who illegally download films are frequently people who have been "inactive" in society and therefore are unlikely to get affected by the recent decision.

In the case of The Amazing Spider-Man there have been complaints about the number of different pirated versions of the film that have been available online. It has been reported that some UK residents have been able to enjoy all five Spider-Man movies but that the films might not be as available outside of the UK as they were intended
