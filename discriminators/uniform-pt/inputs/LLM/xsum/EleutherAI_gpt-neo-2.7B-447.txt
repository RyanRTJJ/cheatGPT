 were sold in the four-month period – a 13.7% year-on-year increase and the highest number of properties sold since November 2016.

The news comes in advance of the official Land Registry Land Transfer (LTL) figures for 2018 which will be published in the January quarter. According to the most recent Land Registry figures released today, Scotland’s residential property market is estimated to grow by 6.8% this year, a rise which would be among the biggest in the UK.

The biggest increase in residential properties sold between October and December was registered in North Lanarkshire, which recorded a 14.5% annual fall in sales, following a 3.7% year-on-year rise in 2017. In total, North Lanarkshire had recorded 2,077 more residential sales than the year previously, and had sold a total of 3,631 properties during the four months.

This compares to figures for the year to September 2017, which show the median value was worth £220,000, compared to the £223,000, £217,000 and £194,000 amounts for the 2016-17, 2015-16 and 2014-15 periods respectively. The median price growth for residential property across the UK was the highest since November 2016, and was higher than the growth rates achieved by the previous three years combined.

Scotland’s median price per property had risen from £156,500 in 2016 to £179,000 in September 2017 and £178,000 in October, 2017 and 2017 respectively.
