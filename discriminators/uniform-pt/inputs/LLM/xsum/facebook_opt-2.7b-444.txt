 it was a priority facility, despite already having a £300m children's unit. Its new building is due to open in a few years time.

At the same time, the trust and other hospitals including Alder Hey face funding cuts, while £75million to redevelop Alder Hey was scrapped in the latest round of funding announcements.

Dr Richard Vautrey, chairman of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said: "We welcome the Prime Minister's announcement of a new £566m Children's Hospital.

"An open and well planned NHS for all is the only way in which we can provide the best possible health care for our children." He said the closure of Alder Hey meant the region "is left without a specialist teaching hospital for children with complex illnesses and injuries". The trust has repeatedly blamed a shortage of staff and funding in recent years for the decision.

Children's Hospital Liverpool's interim chief executive Nigel Ginn said it was "extremely disappointing" the hospital would not be able to stay as part of NHS England.

It was "a decision which we regret as we value our community's continuing support and trust in us".

Alder Hey had also applied to become a specialist hospital for children in the Women and Children's Service, which would have meant reducing its specialist children's beds to just one.

But the application was successful, allowing the hospital to provide a full range of the high-quality medical services for children that it had already been providing for 20 years.

Mr Cameron set a target to invest in the NHS by 2022 - a target which he says should be backed by every child.

Speaking at the launch of Labour's "NHS: Stronger, Better, Faster" manifesto, he said: "We all understand it is the best health service in the world and we should keep it that way."

The Prime Minister also announced that he will hold an emergency summit to discuss the NHS' future.

Labour has said this should include a special conference on the NHS with ministers, trade union leaders and campaigners
