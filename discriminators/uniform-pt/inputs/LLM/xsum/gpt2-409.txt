ures another point for the Sea Eagles following a spirited 1-0 win against the Storm, and the two sides meet again next week. This will make for a tricky game for both, with both sides struggling to get the points they did at St Mary's in the previous round.

Toby Dalglish's men may not be as convincing as they used to, but their pace and pressing ability will have them to cope well. Having beaten St Martin before the tie, the hosts have been a bit slow to adapt to the changes, and given that they haven't scored in a game thus far they'll probably face tough options as the Sea Eagles begin the season without their captain.

However, while their form is much more up against what the rest of the opposition have, the Storm stand out with a clean sheet. As we've seen, the Storm have had a bit of a problem with possession in recent weeks, so the Sea Eagles won't be feeling any of that this time. Their only chance of beating them from behind this week is to use their lack of pace or pressing ability, which will be especially worrying.
