Southampton - Liverpool line up

Giorgio Gourcuff, Daniele Cammalleri, Graziano Pelle, Morgan Schneiderlin, Sadio Mané, Virgil van Dijk, Dejan Lovren, Jordi Alba, Oriol Romeu, Victor Valdes (GK), Florian Lejeune, Saphir Taider, Steven Davis, Sofiane Boufal, Jannik Vestergaard.

FACTS AND FIGURES

Cammalleri (19) made his second Southampton appearance, whilst Schneiderlin (41) started at right-back for the first time in the Premier League. He had previously featured as Villa defender at Anfield on Boxing Day 2013.

Jannik Vestergaard made his competitive debut for the club as a substitute for the injured Jannik Ibsen.

Van Dijk is one of the most experienced centre-halves to have represented the club, having played a total of 36 matches since arriving in a £3m deal from Celtic in January 2014. He signed a new deal in the aftermath of the defeat on Good Friday.

The first of a club-record four-year deal, worth around £65,000 a week, was announced after the 4-0 Premier League win at Swansea on Boxing Day, in which Southampton won for the first time in Liverpool’s history.

Southampton have won just two of their last 18 Premier League games at Anfield, with five draws. Their three previous visit in the competition was in 1994 (3-1).

Schneiderlin’s presence has also made Saints a more physical option, with Liverpool facing a three-man defence for the first time since a 4-0 defeat by Aston Villa in August last year.

Valleys are now also playing for their third consecutive away Premier League fixture, but have kept just one clean sheet in these away encounters – against West Brom in the Carabao Cup in November.
