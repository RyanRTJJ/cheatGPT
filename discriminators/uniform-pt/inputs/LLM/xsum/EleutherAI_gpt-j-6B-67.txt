“During the day I was just a bit disoriented but I didn’t have any problems driving,” he told a Swiss newspaper after the practice crash.

“But at dusk it started and I crashed into a bank. The car went right into the trees and the accident. It was a very dangerous situation. I think that if you are hit in the head it’s the brain, so it’s possible to die instantly. I suffered a very big blow.”

Rega raced with the Swiss F2 championship in 2013 and 2014 but has not been able to return since the accident, which he said happened after he overshot the final corner in an unsanctioned race while driving in the wet.

“I have been waiting for a good weather condition to recover so I can start again,” he said after Friday’s practice at the Red Bull Ring.

“I am happy to be back in the cockpit.”

Rega said he was still in touch, at the wheel and with his engineer and team manager after his accident and is able to communicate using the same methods.

“I still have the same vision in the right and left eye — and I have the same memory,” he added.

“I can see myself doing my turns, I can follow the car with my eyes or I can hear the team’s communication. It’s not as if I can’t understand anything. I listen what they are telling but it’s more like I could read the instructions already on the board if I wanted to.”

Rega said one of his biggest challenges was his helmet, which is on the tightest setting on a F1 machine and was not compatible with his brain injury.

The Swiss driver said he had the same helmet as in his race day accident but has since had to move it up one notch to stop hitting his head on the ceiling as it now only stays on his head without coming
