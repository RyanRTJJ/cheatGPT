 which it calls "a big cat", to be officially listed with another endangered species, the grey seal.

Mr O'Rourke said the government was "bashing" the seal, despite "not finding any evidence of the seal being in serious distress or causing any suffering to anybody". But some fishermen said the seal was only feeding when there were seals around: the seals are attracted to the sound of fishing tackle "as humans and pets have had a tendency to ignore the fact that they're there.

"Our concern is that it's been eating fish. To have a seal in a place where it's eating fish, or where it's making noise, it doesn't look safe to me."

A spokesman for the British & Irish Lions, the country's top football team, said: "We've seen the seal feeding on fish in the village at night," adding that the seal was "playing dead on the rocks and would look like it was having problems".

He said that the seal, which was spotted by a team-mate this weekend, was "very friendly, and he does have a sealish expression which will be a big problem for him".

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it had not seen any reports of problems with the seal, but that it was taking up the issue with the Scottish parliament.

It says: "The Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Land Agency and the Scottish Fisheries Service should look into any concerns raised about the seal's welfare but they have not found any reports of any serious problems.

"We would be particularly concerned that the seal appears to be feeding only at night - a sign of extreme distress or injury."

The seal is one of only a handful of known examples of northern fur seals, which range over a continent from Canada to Greenland and Iceland. The animal was first spotted in the Scottish Highlands, but has since spread to the country's north.
