 testing on larger groups of people, it could help spot those changes before they become cancerous.

But critics question whether the technology is ready to be rolled out commercially.

"We're already talking about mass screening - and the risk is that we're just getting the picture at the point we're most likely to make a mistake," said cancer researcher Andrew Haines from Queen's University Belfast.

He says we should be "skeptical and cautious" when it comes to using it as a screening tool.

In the meantime he suggests the only way to know what's really going on with our bodies is to see our doctors.

"I suspect that in the next few years there will be an explosive rise in testing - perhaps the 'cancer lottery ticket'."

'Risks and benefits'

Professor Neil Pearce from Imperial College London - who is helping to develop the technology by using the same sensors to track the movements of people walking - warns over-relying on it could carry other risks.

"If we treat people with cancer in the same way as we detect cancer we think - the most common cancer in the world - of course it will reduce the number in a few years time. But it won't eradicate it.

"If you start screening on everybody, you've got a lot more people that need to be looked at for disease and you're more likely to pick up the symptoms [of disease] early and then deal with it. I think most people would prefer not to have a lot of these tests."

He adds that more and more people will probably keep this sort of check and feel reassured about their health.

"I think the risk with this is people are quite happy to have a lot of tests done. I think part of the issue is that people will stop feeling happy with any testing unless they're very reassured when you get a negative result."
