 more ‘shared use’ of public transport: for example, they are using their phone to find out what train is next. But what drives people to get up and take the train or bus?

Is bus and train more convenient?

The first question is who is moving about more now about public transport? The ITC found that when it looked at a broad range of transport modes, people are increasingly cycling, walking, taking the bus, or taking the train. These are the most ‘user friendly’ modes.

Cycling or car journey times are longer, as is walking for short journeys. Bus and train times are on average faster. In this last category, the main difference is that people took trains to work earlier than previously. There are now about 60-63 million journeys taken on public transport in Great Britain, down from almost 70 million in 1950.

People in Britain are also going further: many walk home after a meal or go to work or socialise or travel by taxi, rather than driving, as at the time of the study.

If we examine the numbers of people using transport modes to get to different locations in Britain, the share of transport mode taking up the highest shares in different locations is: (the ‘other’ mode category in the table above)

To look at the impact of the reduction in car ownership in Britain, a comparison of the share of car ownership in 1990 and people commuted by car in 1990 is available with the following table:

There are a lot more people commuting in 1990 than in 1990. Of course, there are fewer cars in every year, but the overall rise from 1990 is much steeper. In 1990, about two thirds of households owned a car, down from two thirds in 1990 (see the ITC’s analysis of figures here). In 1990, most people lived close to the station and bus to work. Over the period, population has increased by one fourth (from 1,500,000 to 1.8 million). This has left more people living in rural areas with limited public transport.

Who would use it in future?

There has been a substantial rise in the number of
