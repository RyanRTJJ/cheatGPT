'For the new exhibition, 'The Bull on Campus, It's OK to be Bullish', I have placed the bull in a location on campus where he will be a welcome sight and will not be a nuisance,' artist and activist Michael Ochs wrote on YouTube, describing his new installation 'A Bull on Campus.'

'In addition, while the bull is located in a public place, he is not aggressive towards anyone or anything. He will, however, occasionally bark at motorists who pass by but will generally behave calmly with them.'

The bull is in fact part of a larger installation at the School of Law building at Yale University, where students and faculty can see it and are encouraged to sign a statement saying they're against sexism and transphobia.'


A new campaign 'It's OK to be Bullish' has taken aim at a controversial statue of a bull on the campus of Yale University in New Haven, Conn.

The bull has been a source of contention from many quarters since it was constructed last year, and was installed with only one side facing the university's main entrance while the other side - which has been labelled as a'male gaze' - faces down the street.

The statue and its construction have drawn attention from many of the college's students, who see it as an attack upon their masculinity - as demonstrated by a recent report by the ACLU which claimed that Yale is one of the most hostile places for women.

The statue, named 'Equal As A Woman,' was built by a local artist who hopes that it will bring more students and faculty to the university.


But since receiving approval last year, the statue and its installation have drawn attention from many of the college's students, who see it as an attack upon their masculinity
