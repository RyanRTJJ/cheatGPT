 was a “professional businessman” and did not need police on the ground in Libya. Mr Beidhuu, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the Red Cross was willing to talk with everyone in the country who had known bin Laden. “All of the parties must put their trust and faith in the ICC,” he told the Guardian.

A spokesman for the Egyptian foreign ministry also dismissed the ICC requests as a “tactical decision” and dismissed the allegations. He said Egyptians had been helping the peace process and would continue to do so. “We do all that we can to ensure that all problems between us and the Libyan factions will be solved through dialogue and through bilateral talks through the Red Cross and other representatives of the UN,” he said. “The situation at hand is of national interest, not a crisis of international interest.”

He said Libya is a country where everyone has to cooperate with their neighbours. “We all must sit together at the round table table to find solutions without violence. We, as Egyptian people, do not want this violence,” he said. Libya wants peace with its neighbours now, rather than waiting for a crisis that might lead to violence.

Mr Beidhuu told Libya’s ambassador in Geneva, Ibrahim Dabbashi, that “they should have waited for a little bit and let the process develop” before demanding that the ICC arrest him. The ICC’s prosecutor said earlier he was “totally open” to interviewing Mr Beidhuu, and that such action was “not a decision” by the organisation.

The ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said on Friday: “I think the legal situation is that if someone was found at the Libyan airport, or on Libyan territory, or inside Libyan territory, with knowledge to bin Laden’s whereabouts, that would be on the basis of what is the charge. The crime is a war crime.” But, he said, it was hard to know whether the allegations were true: “This is a country where the evidence for a charge is not always available.”
