The report is expected to conclude with a list of further steps Exeter prison authorities should take to safeguard the prison estate. The HMI has already issued a series of recommendations to improve the quality of health provision at prison establishments. Its own staff have reported that violent incidents have increased since the establishment of the HMP Exeter, and have seen a rise in self-harm and mental health problems among inmates.



HMP Exeter is now under special measures after a number of violent incidents took place following the launch of an enhanced resettlement programme, including one in which a prison officer was stabbed in the head. In December 2013, it was also made aware of an inmate who died outside the prison on the grounds of one of the satellite units he had been on.



The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is considering the HMI findings and will respond within six months. David Alton, head of the HMI, said: “These findings are clearly about the failure of staff on the estate, including inadequate supervision of prisoners and the failure of the Ministry of Justice to ensure that adequate levels of healthcare are available to prisoners.

“We are not seeking to criticise staff, but in some critical areas, this is simply not acceptable. For example, there have been significant reductions in healthcare resources in the estate since 2012, when this unit was first established, which cannot continue.

“As part of our wider review of HM Prison Service, ministers will consider further steps in respect of this estate beyond the establishment of a management team.”
