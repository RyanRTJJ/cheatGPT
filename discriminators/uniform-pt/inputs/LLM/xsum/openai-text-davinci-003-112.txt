The news has been met with disappointment from patients, who relied on the free service to get to their appointments. Those assessable in advance will still receive the service, with further support put in place for those that do not. People can apply for exemption in terms of disability or medical requirements and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Ipswich Hospital is working hard to maintain its high standards of patient care and safety in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The hospital has taken the difficult decision to stop the free service for patients, ensuring resources are used responsibly to maintain the safety of all patients and staff. The hospital is happy to support patients who require the service due to disability or medical reasons and will assess these cases on an individual basis. Patients are advised to make contact with the hospital as early as possible in order to receive the necessary support in good time.
