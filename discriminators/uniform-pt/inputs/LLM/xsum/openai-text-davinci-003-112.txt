 and his girlfriend have been living at the property since late 2018.

The dispute began when the landlord, Dr Kamal Ramdharry, attempted to increase the monthly rent to £1,050, but Mr Crawford said he only could afford to pay around £700. Dr Ramdharry then began to take legal action against Mr Crawford in January 2021, seeking possession of the house. 

In May, Mr Crawford was given a court order to vacate the property by a Judge at Nottingham County Court. After attempts by Mr Crawford to appeal the decision were dismissed by the tenant's appeal court, Nottingham City Council arranged for bailiffs to carry out the eviction, which occurred on the 21st July. 

Mr Crawford, his son and his son's girlfriend have since been camping in a nearby park. The other four people living with them have had to seek alternative housing. 

In the months since the eviction, local campaigners, housing charities and even the local MP have been rallying to support Mr Crawford and the others. Tom Baines, a housing solicitor at the charity Shelter, said that despite the court ruling, 'there is absolutely no excuse for a landlord to evict anyone onto the street during a pandemic'. Nottingham City Council have also been speedy in trying to rehouse the family as soon as possible. 

Nevertheless, it has been an immensely difficult time for the family. Moreover, many fear that this case is indicative of the wider issues of a housing shortage in the UK and a lack of tenant protection.
