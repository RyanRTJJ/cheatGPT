 Games, after taking silver four years ago in Vancouver.

Canada and Muirhead first teamed up in 1995 when she was in her mid-teenage years, and have been a formidable force at world championships. While Canada has been dominant, Muirhead made a few changes to her game in the lead-up to these Games and said the change made her better prepared.

The silver that Canada won at Vancouver has long been considered the nation's most difficult Olympic medal to secure, due to how difficult the men's hockey tournament is, and the fact that Muirhead and teammates Jocelyne Larocque and Angela James won the event four years ago.

It took nine rounds and nearly five hours of tense hockey action to decide the bronze. The Swedes had tied the Canadian team 2-2 in the quarter-final and then eliminated them 4-2 in overtime of the semifinals.

Canada had dominated the bronze-medal game before Sweden's goalie, Lisa Thomai, made two huge saves in the fourth period to pull the team to a tie. When the Swedes' captain, Frida Hansdotter, scored to give her team a 3-2 lead at the 5:07 mark of overtime, Canada's goalie, Shannon Szabados, made a stellar glove save on a two-on-one.

The goal was to give Thomai some last-minute rest before facing a shootout. It was a tough call on the part of Canadian coach Laura Schuler, who said the decision to ask for the short shift in a 6-4 victory came down to two factors: whether Canada should be able to withstand Swedish pressure in a shoot-out, and whether it could win a shoot-out.

"Once the game was in overtime, we were confident we were going to push harder and would be able to win the game," Schuler said. "So we wanted her to take a rest because we believe we are going to be able to withstand pressure in a shoot-out if it comes, and she had proven that. And she had proven that a few times. You've got shooters going to shoot, and they're good scorers, whether it's 20 or 5,000."

Schuler didn't consider whether
