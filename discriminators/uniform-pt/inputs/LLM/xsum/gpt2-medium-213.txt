The collision left him in a critical condition in hospital.

He is now receiving further and better treatment before being discharged from intensive care yesterday afternoon.

Hazem Moussa, his brother-in-law, said the family was "devastated".

The family's father, Saleh Moussa, said: "We have been left without a father in our family for so long; all of it very traumatic for us."

But the mother insisted the crash had had no impact on her own family, adding: "There were no consequences whatsoever for us, except that our daughter has lost four teeth, and there are many other difficulties which we will have to deal with in coming days."

The full statement by the family is attached. The Telegraph understands some of the children are staying in Paul Mayor's care but more children are expected to be returned to the school.

Mr Mayor, who has been elected again for Glasgow West council last month, will be allowed to continue at the school.

He has previously said if elected it would "not only bring prosperity to the area but improve living standards".

A police spokeswoman said: "Investigating officers are currently liaising with a senior manager on behalf of the school council.

"The investigation will continue once full reports are fully known."

An education spokeswoman said: "Paul Mayor University has confirmed these students are safe and that they are attending in a safe manner.

"We ask the community to respect their privacy at this time and look forward to welcoming the students back to their place of study."

A spokesman for Westbank schools, the local branch of the education sector, said in a statement: "The safety of all pupils is paramount to the success of our students and staff. The safety and well-being of all of our pupils and staff remains our highest priority.

"These cases were currently being reviewed by teachers and staff from Paul Mayor University to provide us with a thorough understanding of the circumstances regarding the circumstances at play."
