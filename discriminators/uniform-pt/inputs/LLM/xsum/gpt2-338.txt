 a break it was only possible to play," said Navidad. "That meant that you were given the ball and it was very much in the hands of the players.


"That meant you were given a chance to try to score on our day, but that was the wrong idea. If we weren't going backwards there would be injuries and penalties and we wouldn't be in the Championship and nobody would know where we were. The club manager is the only one we felt comfortable playing in."


Mantel's goal in the 69th minute sealed the win for Middlesbrough which saw the Baggies reach the Championship semi-finals. The club had already lost four matches against the Championship's top sides which included the away side Celtic.


"The players that want to win the championship have to take the lead," said David Bentley, head coach at Everton. "They will be there but not every team that plays is going to have a real chance."


The club have also been in the lead after a disappointing 4-0 win over Crystal Palace at home on Saturday. It will be a long week for a player who hasn't only won the All-Star Game but also claimed a European double against the top clubs in the United Kingdom and even beaten an average of three league games during his first four years at Everton.


Mantel's first three Premier League games under Mauricio Pochettino have come against Newcastle (5-6), Liverpool (5-8), Aston Villa (6-6) and Tottenham (7-6). They are all set to play their first three Premier League matches of the season as Manchester United play Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United.


Mantel's goal in the 77th minute ended a draw with Southampton by an equaliser. In a league where there has been a three-goal gap between sides since January, Mauricio Pochettino's side are one game into a season unbeaten in their last seven league games. A win by United over Aston Villa on Saturday puts them on top of the league.
