ying and selling land around major supermarket sites) is actually in a declining and declining market.

When the land value of the UK supermarket chain is compared with its main rivals, the first property is seen to have gone up a massive 60%. The value of the UK's other four rivals rose by a total of 42%.

The results follow an analysis of two years of supermarket chain sales made by Property Data Wales on behalf of the Welsh Government.

This has previously warned that the market was becoming saturated as well as overly concentrated.

It now says the most "viable" supermarket areas are not necessarily the ones with the most number of supermarkets.

At around 40,000 Tesco stores, for example, the most valuable areas are in Wales: Cardiff, Newport, Wrexham and Merthyr Tydfil, all at an assessed value of more than £1bn.

And in the most challenging and most desirable areas - the capital city areas - it figures that a supermarket could be worth an average of £40m a year, up from around £20m, on average, in the rest of the UK.

On the other hand, the figures paint Britain as a "very competitive" market, with only about nine supermarket companies commanding anything closer to the market share expected of 20 years ago.

But all of the retailers which are currently in the public domain are currently competing for a "vast number" of supermarket chains in a relatively "thin" market, with "very little overlap" between them, said Property Data Wales director of marketing David Davies.

Consequently, the group are not building as many stores.

"It is not at all obvious to us that the 'best and fairest' in the UK are necessarily in these same core locations," said Davies.

"We see that as a huge mis-use of money, in
