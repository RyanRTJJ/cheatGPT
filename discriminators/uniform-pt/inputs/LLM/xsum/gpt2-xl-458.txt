Two new US sanctions announced on Friday by the Treasury Department target top officials from several Russian state-owned companies and the Federal Security Service on Friday, citing their alleged involvement in financing the US election hack last year.

The Treasury Department alleged that the officials held up sanctions on behalf of sanctioned entities using so-called "gray" companies.

Mr Putin dismissed allegations made by US intelligence agencies that Russia was behind the breach. "We are not going to sit and write about it," he said at a summit hosted by China last month, according to a transcript published by the Russian news agency Iwa, which cited Mr Putin.
