 of Ireland 3-0 in Group D

It was a game of sheer, unforced errors from both sides. Ireland, who are second in the Euro 2016 qualifying rankings after their group success and currently top the group, spent seven minutes in midfield while Wales, who are fourth, spent the opening 15 minutes at home without a shot on goal, and then were wasteful from the edge of the box.

England coach Roy Hodgson, whose team have drawn 3-3 against Slovakia and Croatia so far, said after the game that "all I can say is they're all young, inexperienced. If you look at some of them, they're at a new club and are still young in some cases. They're not experienced players and we know that."

Ireland, though - the champions of Europe since 1987 - have no record at Euro 2016 but with a World Cup win over France in 1960 and the European Championship victory in 1987, they are a well-established side but have not yet won a major tournament.

In the Czech Republic, there have been few chances on either side and the victory was all the sweeter because it took the hosts' match hopes. Their only previous experience of the European Championship was back in 1934, when a 2-5 victory was their only victory over France, who were coached by Frank Rijkaard at that time.
