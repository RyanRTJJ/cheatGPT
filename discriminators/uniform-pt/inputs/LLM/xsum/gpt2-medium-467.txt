atroopers and army police attacked a Catholic mass celebrating the birthday of Martin McGuinness as commander-in-chief of the Democratic Unionist Party. The report found that at least 30 Irish republicans were involved and that Sinn FÃ©in had been responsible. During the following months, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) government used a series of military coups for political gain and, after 1975, was led democratically to power in a general election. One of the key demands of the republican leadership at the time was that the vote on the referendum take place in the centre of Dublin rather than in the North. After his death, Martin McGuinness told Irish press how he felt "deeply moved" by the findings but that they did not change his belief in the rightness or wrongness of the republican cause.
