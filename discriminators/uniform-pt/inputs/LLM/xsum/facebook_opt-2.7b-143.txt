More than 400 employees are set to be transferred from another location in the US, near Boston, to the West End.

It will form part of the company’s North American ‘OneSource’ operation, which includes the entire range of human resources services to small and mid-size businesses in the US, Canada, Australia, France, Spain, New Zealand and India, as well as UK, Ireland and New Zealand.

“We take the term ‘one contact’ as seriously as we do our customers - that is, to serve you as thoroughly as possible,” commented OneSource co-founder and chief executive Chris Gosset.

He said a OneSource team would give employees, particularly those leaving the company, “the time and attention of a small firm with the best of both worlds. This is not just a company, it is a family. We make life work for people and their organisations better, and we do it by listening to what we see as their problems.”

OneSource has a global workforce of 25,900 people. It was created eight years ago in 2002 when the company was sold to private equity firm Carlyle Group.

More than €600 million has been invested into the business so far and the company is now part of US private equity giant Bain Capital.

The latest announcement follows a spate of company-wide jobs announcements in recent weeks, including the opening of a hub in Belfast to handle the work of its customer in the north-east of England.

In March, technology giant IBM was reported to have brought 500 IT and operations jobs to Derry.

AIB chief executive David McWilliams and IBPS chief executive Tom Duffy announced the company would be opening a specialist operations centre in Derry as part of plans to grow its business in the north-west of Ireland while maintaining its presence in Dublin.
