 2003.
She underwent a major operation to remove a benign tumour from her left breast in early 2004, and was diagnosed with breast cancer in November that year.
The news comes as a shock as the popular presenter enjoyed a happy marriage to husband Matthew Robertson for 18 years, and the couple have four children together.
Ms Cafferkey fell ill with the meningitis last week, but a spokesperson for the couple said they had no idea how she had contracted it.
Matthew issued a statement, writing: "It is with huge disappointment that I have to confirm a very serious turn of events.
"Last week, my wife Kate was admitted to hospital with bacterial meningitis.
"The condition has developed a severe infection and Kate, for the time being, remains in hospital in a serious condition.
"A long and painful recovery is expected; and we ask for privacy from this point onwards for Kate and our young family."
Ms Cafferkey's diagnosis with meningitis was announced by Piers Morgan on Twitter on Friday, after the ITV News presenter had spotted the presenter on the red carpet for the film In Our Name at the Southbank Centre in London.
"Sorry to see @CafferkeyKate ill and needing hospital treatment. She's doing brilliantly and I hope she gets well soon", he wrote.
