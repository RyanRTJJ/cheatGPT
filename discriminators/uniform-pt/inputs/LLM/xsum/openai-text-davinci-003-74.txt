"I really had to deliver today and it was really close. It's really nice to have another one-two for Mercedes and I'm really happy to be on the top side of it."

Vettel, who qualified in second place, said: "I was too slow today and ended up in second, but at least we can take away the car was very good and I was happy with it.

"It’s good to be back on the podium, and it’s also obviously a boost of confidence to know that I had the pace to keep up with Lewis."
