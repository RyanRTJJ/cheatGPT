"My ambition is to try and get back into the Football League by whatever means.

"Part of my role will be to nurture players to the next level on and off the pitch, and when they do move on it's important that they are good citizens, as people can forget that aspect of the game."

Gerrard's impressive CV includes spells with Liverpool, Birmingham City and Walsall, for whom he made more than 250 appearances.

The former Wolves defender left the Saddlers by mutual consent in December, 2006 and last featured for Norwich City in a 5-0 Carling Cup defeat by Colchester in August 2007.

After being without a contract for 12 months, Gerrard has now set his sights on trying to help Bromsgrove get back into the Football League and has no regrets about the decision to drop out of the professional ranks.

"At the time, it was about timing and the circumstances lacked a bit of enthusiasm," said Gerrard.

"At 33, I'm still feeling fairly fit but I'm a realist and realise I'm not as fit as I was 10 years ago. But it's still comforting to know that I can affect a match or a performance and shape the career of a youngster.

"That's why when Bromsgrove gave me the chance, I thought this might be a nice environment to go into and theatre the end of my career."
