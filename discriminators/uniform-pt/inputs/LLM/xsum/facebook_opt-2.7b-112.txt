 NHS England’s Clinical Commissioning Group’s (CCG) guidance to not provide an assessment, which requires a consultation with a consultant or a team-based assessment.

The spokesperson said: “While we understand the need for patients to have some discretion, the hospital must do everything in its power to ensure that when they do attend the trust, it is safe to do so. That includes making sure no one is present from whom a potential COVID-19 carrier could obtain the infection; a person who has not undertaken appropriate isolation has not entered the building; and there is an assessment team in place to carry out appropriate assessments and ensure patients comply with the relevant laws and government guidelines, particularly around staying away from work, meetings and other social events.”

She said the hospital had not experienced any COVID-19 cases so far during the outbreak. “Currently, we are working to minimise risk of COVID entering our building by undertaking risk assessments, including those carried out by consultants and team members,” she said. “We are also doing all we can to ensure that no one will come to work if they have any symptoms, or if we believe they’ve been in contact with someone who has COVID and has had the disease but has not had symptoms.”

Patients with persistent symptoms who are still having tests will be offered an assessment by an infectious disease doctor before the appointment, the statement said.

The spokesperson said clinicians were continuing to develop the process for managing COVID-19 patients in hospital safely. It is “too early” to say if the measures that hospitals are taking are the right ones, she added. However, she said other organisations that had introduced similar criteria had seen an immediate drop-off in attendance because their patients were unable to access free services.

“If the public are concerned that their healthcare may be affected, then we strongly encourage them to take extra care to follow government guidance, including regular hand washing and staying home when unwell,” she said.
