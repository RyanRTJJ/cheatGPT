 solicitor General for National Security, Justice, Justice and Integrity Colin McGowen said: "It is clear that the force did not get in line with a number of its guidelines on investigating terrorism cases by holding public hearings when the issues were well-known." It is understood that the evidence on those issues can't be put forward.

Mr Justice McComb said that the police "have a clear strategy not only to conduct themselves effectively but in the best interests of justice in our justice system".

He also said that police had been given legal authority to remove "terrorist or terrorist organisations from the public square or other places of public visit".

Mr Justice McComb said other powers of the CPS were limited to national security and did not allow him to comment on the police's conduct.

In February, former CPS chief of general operations Andrew Gray became the first UK chief justice to take legal action against police on the grounds of racial racism.

The government has said it will bring charges against anyone who has acted against police officers or has threatened to bring such behaviour against them.

The story has been updated to correct part of the sentence to 27 years in prison. The original article said that a sentence of 27 years in prison would have a maximum penalty of 15 years, which has been reduced to 5 years' jail.
