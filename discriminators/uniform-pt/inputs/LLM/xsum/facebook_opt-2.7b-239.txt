 claimed because an American was taking the photo.

According to Mr Slater, the "monstrous monkey" grabbed the camera when he was taking pictures of his seven-year-old son, Arthur.

Mr Slater, from Penmachno, Monmouthshire, said he was devastated that the image would not be allowed to enter the public domain.

"I was absolutely stunned to learn the court has ruled that a child who died in my arms is not fit to share his memory," he said.

"The only way to get to what my child would want is to put his image on the Internet.

"When Arthur died, I started to get in touch with the family of the dead monkey and I learned it had been picked by a terrible and monstrous monkey.

"I don't feel they should have to pay for that."

Mr Slater said his son had fallen ill shortly after the monkey grabbed the camera, but that he would live if he could have "the same amazing experience that his dad had".

The photographer has been allowed to keep the copyright, but said people should be able to share images taken by their children's eyes.

"While they would not have wanted to have a monkey that had picked up their camera, they would do anything to ensure their child got to see my images after they had died," he said.

Mr Slater said he also wanted anyone who might want to contact Arthur to see the pictures.

"If you are in the area, take a look. It's hard and saddening, really. There are photos of my son's birthday party to remember."

He said he was willing to share copyright of the images with Mr Slater, but added: "I do hope you are happy with your decision."

The case was heard by a US federal district court on 22 March. It is a long shot that the claim to the copyright will be successful, Mr Slater said. He had hoped the claim would be thrown out but was satisfied when a judge ruled it could not be heard.
