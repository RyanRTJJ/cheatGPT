 - the unemployed, the self-employed and those who take part in other forms of intermittent work - are entitled to claim the New Deal.

But Ms Rudd said: "It is up to companies to draw up their own plans to be fair where they use the New Deal to help those people who are most in need.

"They can do that when they work with local businesses, with charities, with social enterprises."

The rules, set within the government's Jobs Act, will mean that those who are on the minimum wage, or whose average weekly pay is zero, will be eligible to be given the benefit. Those people - who are expected to draw £18.10 for every week they work - will be paid £12.13, or £6.53 for every day.

Filing an application will include providing evidence that the new job offers prospects with better pay, more promotion opportunities, opportunities to take early retirement, more flexibility or greater benefits than other jobs. It will also include evidence of how the proposed employer has given opportunities to the person to engage in personal and work-related training, training for training or training for job skills.

Any employer wishing to take the benefit must give applicants details of how they have responded to the request for information, ensuring that any offer of new work meets the criteria set out within the act.

Included on the list of criteria employers must consider are "whether it offers employees more opportunities to contribute to the community than they would have with work as they currently did"; whether the employer has created "a workplace that is more enjoyable for the employee and in which they continue to feel valued and encouraged"; and whether the employer is committed to recruiting people "who need the help provided by this scheme".

If they are satisfied the application meets these criteria, they will process the decision within the first 18 months after receiving it. Otherwise, they must extend the period of time within which they will process the decision.

"Employers can't just simply turn-a-round and decide to take no action. They must give people a fair deal and be clear what they are going to pay to those people who are in that situation," Ms
