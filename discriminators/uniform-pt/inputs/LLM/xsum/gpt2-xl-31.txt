 many years to come is so gratifying and exciting for myself and my family. I have no doubt that The Queen's Club will provide him and us with the stability needed to help build on our achievements," said Head Coach Alan Wainwright.

A new era will come to Old Trafford this summer as Sir Alex Ferguson's son, David, becomes the club's new director of football. Sir Alex, who recently said that he would see out the rest of his playing life in the Premier League, will be replaced by his son. David will be presented with the reins at the end of the season. The 43-year-old previously worked with Ferguson during the Scot's brief return to management in September 2007.

Ferguson's two sons, Jason and Gary, have been appointed as the club's managing director and chief executive respectively, replacing their father.

Last year, Manchester United paid a world record fee for the services of former Manchester United midfielder Patrice Evra who departed the club for Juventus on £25million, beating the previous transfer record set by Spanish giants Real Madrid in January 2007.

After a season in Serie A, Evra has been a regular in the French Top 14 during a loan period, winning the Pro D2 title (the equivalent of the England Second Division) in May.

He has also secured a contract extension with Inter Milan and becomes the second former United player to play in the competition. The first, George Best, represented the Red Devils between 1953 and 1958.

Best was a regular for United between 1953 and 1957. The defender had a £1m transfer with his club and was the first of a new breed of European stars to arrive at Old Trafford.

Meanwhile, on Monday the Premier League announced six new signings for their squads.

These new players are:

New signing Jordan Chiles (Crystal Palace)
