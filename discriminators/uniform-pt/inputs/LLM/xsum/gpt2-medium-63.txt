 the Irish Times when he made a comparison between the SNP and the working class "after the Second World War", but the comparison was inaccurate and misleading. Labour was in decline, the SNP in full ascendency, with mass trade unionism emerging.

For those who don't know, the Trade Unions Act of 1946, which gave the ruling Labour Party power to set about destroying the working class in Britain, was aimed at achieving the objective of taking power away from the political left and allowing it to be dominated by the party machine. Since 1947, Labour has waged relentless attack on the TUC, the trade unions which had developed between 1915 and 1935, with its influence on trade unionist politics in Britain. It has had much help from sections of the Conservative Party – to name one notable example – before it gained its current success as a party of business. Labour lost about 40 per cent of its voting share in 1997–98, down from 53 per cent in 1979–80.

For a time the party – and its supporters – fought against the TUC in all the unions, but now they are in line with the wider interests of their corporate overlords. One of the chief characteristics of the new SNP movement is that they are not looking the other way or pretending they don't know how Labour's trade unions work. On the contrary, many in the media and public have openly mocked, ridiculed and belittled them.

This is not to mention that it is an unprecedented outburst of opposition, an unprecedented assault on Labour, its trade unions and its policies, and its most significant achievement since 1945. It is the first time political
