 16 seconds to complete the book, according to Guinness Book of World Records.

According to her personal website: "If you don't think you're faster than a 7'10" person, you were never meant to be."

After the race, Harper Lee told reporters she looked forward to returning to her home in Boston and finishing the finished book.

"I would much rather be somewhere to enjoy the book than racing that crazy time record now," she said of the time. "In the past I've done that and then had to turn back to finish. I'd much rather have some time where I'm fine and can finish the book and see what I can do on race day."

Harper Lee's book "Gone With the Wind" was first published in 1953. It was the highest-selling book of all time in the United States. Harper Lee has been called one of the great role models of 20th-century American culture. She died Friday at home from leukemia at age 87.

McGrath, who became champion of his high school age team the last time they met in May 1982, was running third at the time.

"I was shocked, shocked â€” shocked," he told The Associated Press by telephone from his home in Portland, Oregon.

McGrath said his speed-reading technique led to "more surprises" for him during race, particularly as he lost track of time.

McGrath admitted he would have won faster if he stayed in the lead.

"It was a pretty crazy race," he said.
