 use one of three approved codes to comment on online issues.

The only three acceptable codes are: "I'm afraid I was unable to locate the document". "Unfortunately I don't have the answer to your question", "Please contact the Department".

"It is vital that the digital service team is working closely with members of the workforce on a day-to-day basis to ensure that they recognise how to use Twitter, email and all other communication channels to engage in constructive and friendly discussion," a senior Department for Communities and Local Government source said. "The current situation is unacceptable and the use of the inappropriate emoticons in relation to this topic are disappointing."

Staff were informed of the new rules just hours before the DCLG wrote its consultation papers. The Daily Telegraph reported that Twitter posts related to the consultation were removed from all Department for Communities and Local Government work pages late last night.

A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesperson confirmed that the decision to replace Twitter emoticons with the aforementioned three codes was "procedural only". However he also stressed that any staff who "lacked a clear understanding" of the rules would have to "submit a written explanation of the breach to the department's Human Resource Management Manager by 10am on Monday 29 September 2015" or they would lose their roles.

The MailOnline also reported that Twitter has been advised by the UK's Communications Commissioner that the emoticons used by work colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government could be "misinterpreted" by the public. This applies, but for a reduced period, to all government departments.

A DCLG spokesperson said: "The department will publish a consultation paper on the rules by the end of Monday." They also insisted that staff were free to discuss anything at all on Twitter.

In December last year, after a two-day consultation run by the DCLG, employees in Whitehall were given rules to follow when discussing the government's spending plans. They include:

"Twitter users are not permitted to publish or comment on information which could damage the department's reputation, unless you are a member of staff.

In addition, staff must register with the department, in a form available online, before commenting on government matters."
