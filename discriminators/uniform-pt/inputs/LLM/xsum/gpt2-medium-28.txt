 admitted causing death by dangerous driving in the circumstances of the fatal traffic accident but denied causing death by dangerous driving during the police evidence.

She claimed that an officer gave her insufficient evidence as to why her driving was so dangerous. She denied driving a vehicle over the speed limit. She did not accept that she caused her own death by drinking as this had not been proved in court.

Following Ms Mills' plea counsel for the family of the victim, Jim Mills, QC, stated that he was satisfied by the evidence of the police officers given that no reasonable person would accept Ms Mills' claim that her driving was so dangerous that she believed others were in danger as it had been proven by video and photographs that Ms Mills was unable to stop herself from drinking.

Judge Paul MacSherry rejected that evidence as it was an extraordinary and exceptional case.

Mr Mills spoke of an incident in which he stopped a driver for no reason other than the driver was drunk. He said he had stopped the driver to tell Ms Mills that his driver's licence had been suspended for 11 months because of a drunk driving offence.

Judge MacSherry noted that the woman denied she had driven that badly. "What would you say in your circumstances?" he asked.

'Unlawful conduct'

Ms Mills also claimed that it had been shown that her conduct was unlawful and that she would have been entitled to a trial on that basis.

Judge MacSherry said that, in his view, no reasonable lawyer would expect that Ms Mills would commit her own suicide if the Crown did not have, after taking all the circumstances of the case, to go to court to show that Ms Mills' driving was so dangerous that she believed others were in danger.

"I would not accept, if you are seeking a life sentence, that that was the case," he said.

'Burden cannot be met at common law'

The judge also imposed on the state a 30 month probation order for Ms Mills and suspended the jail term from the date
