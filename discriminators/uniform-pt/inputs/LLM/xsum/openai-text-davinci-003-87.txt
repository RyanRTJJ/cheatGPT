 that the use of facial recognition to detect people on watchlists could infringe civil liberties.

The report found the technology was both cost-effective and accurate, and the risk of false positives had "reduced dramatically" to around one in 500. It concluded that the technology was a valuable tool for police, but said it was important to introduce safeguards to ensure it was used properly.

It also raised concerns about how the data is used and how decisions are made based upon facial recognition images. The report called for the introduction of "appropriate privacy controls" and for police forces to consult with privacy experts to ensure the technology is used ethically.

The report said facial recognition technology "should only be used where there is clear operational justification and where the balance of beneficial outcomes outweighs the intrusion on privacy and data security risks".

The report called on police forces to be more transparent about their use of the technology, both with the public and with relevant authorities. This could include publishing detailed information on the number of images captured, the accuracy of the systems, and the results of real-time facial recognition operations.

Overall, the report concluded that facial recognition technology can transform the way police work, but the potential implications must be considered carefully. It said police forces should be aware of civil liberties concerns and take measures to ensure that the technology is implemented ethically.
