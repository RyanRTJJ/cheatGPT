utoglu a promotion.

While Mr Davutoglu's speech was seen as the most prominent gesture of support for the new Mr Erdogan, Mr Erdogan's relationship with Turkey's Western allies was also under assault.

Mr Erol said Mr Davutoglu's speech "says a lot about Turkey's relations with Turkey and with the EU".

"The fact the chancellor does not want to be part of a government with him is one element of it. That is not the only one," said Erol. He added that Mr Davutoglu's speech was another indication that Turkey needed stability in the EU.

"We, the people, have a government, the people and the government, and there is nothing wrong with that. It's a government of consensus. If there is a government of consensus, then why would there need to be a prime minister that does not agree with the government of that government? And this is not how Turkey is."

Mr Davutoglu's speech appeared to signal that the Turkish authorities would not interfere in the leadership election of Mr Erdogan's ally and prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu (S) after a court in July banned the process.

Mr Davutoglu said it was his decision to make, not a party call of the party.

Mr Davutoglu will likely face questions about whether he will have enough backing if a government is formed, given his past actions as foreign minister, while leading the anti-government Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP).

On Monday his HDP party's co-chair, Selahattin Demirtas, said Mr Davutoglu's party had a responsibility to help the new government, before calling for a state of emergency in Turkey. Mr Demirtas and Mr Davutoglu attended the same G20 meeting in Germany.

Speaking during his speech on Tuesday, Mr Davutoglu added that Turkey was ready to hold "democratic elections" in Turkey and that the political process should be completed.

But he stressed he was not ruling out joining the European Union and that there were "many ways" the EU could help Turkey.
