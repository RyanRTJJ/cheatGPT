n crime and violence in the city has yielded positive results, with the homicide rate dropping from an all-time high of 432 in 2017 to 208 in 2018. The deaths also declined by 32.6 per cent in the first four months of 2019 compared to the same period last year.

The strategy implemented to reduce crime in the city focused on patrolling hotspot areas and engagement with local communities, as well as increasing the presence of closer police stations. The security ministry also has deployed additional officers to address local crime and gangs, particularly involved in drug-trafficking. Additionally, a technological solution was implemented to address robberies. This includes a wireless security system which has over 700 subscribers in the city, to operate an emergency response center that can rapidly respond to robberies and burglaries.

The cooperation of local authorities, police and community organizations have also had a significant positive impact on the reduction in crime. Through outreach activities and events, local authorities have been able to build a strong relationship with the community, so local citizens are increasingly more committed in their support of law enforcement. 

Positive results can also be attributed to educational and recreational activities now available to the younger population. A drastic reduction in poverty has also contributed to the lower crime rates, as people in need are less likely to resort to criminal activities. 

The lessening of homicides in Colon is a good example of how a comprehensive approach to crime reduction can be successful in a high risk area. Nonetheless, more work needs to be done in order to completely restore peace and security in this city.
