 Before leaving on her last flight, she wrote a touching goodbye letter to her mother.

A few days before her first attempt, she wrote:



Mum,

In the event of failure I may not return so please dont worry but if I do and do not find you again I hope you will realize that I must give much thought to our separation and to the fact that you have tried so hard for me. You are so dear to me that one day I shall never be able to replace you.

I shall be happy to give you my word to look after you but it is impossible for me to promise I will tell you where I am but I will remember and always be grateful.

You are so good but I shall never return with any child of yours, that I know is good and is dear to you.

So goodbye.

Lovingly,

GJ

This heartfelt letter will never be posted to anyone - as it is too painful for the recipient to see.

Her flight was to take place in a Short S.41A biplane in 1930 which carried two-bladed propellers. Her navigator was Harry Rutter, a test pilot who was killed when a biplane he was flying went into a spin over the North Sea.

On January 21, 1941, she attempted a night flight from Land's End to Sydney via the Isle of Wight. She crashed into the Thames Estuary after a failed landing attempt at Clacton in her Short S.41A biplane near Herne Bay, Kent. The crash killed her and her navigator Harry Rutter, aged 30.

Following the crash Johnson is thought to have been on the boat that rescued a family who came across her dead body on the shores of the Estuary in the hours after the tragedy.

The incident - a year before her 31st birthday - was the first time the pilot had soloâ€™d after eight practice flights.
