 to enter pleas to the charges on 10 March.

All three men worked for Cogent, a British firm providing telecoms services.

After leaving Cogent in December 2008, one left to work as a consultant to a rival firm, the SFO said. One of the men, Rogberg, was subsequently appointed as an adviser to his old firm.

But Cogent paid all three salaries while they were working for rivals.

SFO spokeswoman Alison Saunders said: "Cogent's activities were unlawful and it is alleged that Cogent and the three former executives committed acts of fraud by false accounting and deliberately misled its customers on several matters relating to the provision and management of services to them.

"This could affect Cogent's customers as well as the company, and may create a public interest in understanding the extent of the company's misconduct."

The alleged fraud relates to contracts worth hundreds of millions of pounds and was committed before the 2008 financial crisis.

Cogent's three principals "are said to have systematically used dishonest accounting, misleading and deceptive conduct and deliberately suppressed material from the company's external auditors, Deloitte & Touche", the SFO said.

The agency said Rogberg "is accused of being involved in Cogent's misconduct in addition to the other two defendants, while the other former Cogent executives have been accused of having played different roles."

Rogberg's alleged misconduct included instructing his firm to create an additional Â£20m turnover. He is also accused of instructing that all material to Deloitte about the "additional" revenue be destroyed and "deliberately misleading its directors about the extent of Cogent's misconduct".

Rogberg told the Financial Times: "A charge under section 115A of the Crime and Courts Act 2003 is the last thing I am worried about.

"The charge is without evidence or any explanation. It is the height of absurdity that I am arrested for making certain facts known in the public domain to journalists."
