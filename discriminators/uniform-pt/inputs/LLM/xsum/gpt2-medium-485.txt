. She noted that the Scottish government now had the legal standing to launch legal proceedings against any UK government which tried to impose border controls on Scottish passport holders.

The European Union's justice ministers are scheduled to be called before a EU commission meeting in Brussels in December for a consultation on plans to reform the European Arrest Warrant (EAW). The European Arrest Warrant is designed to deal with border controls and terrorism.

Shaw explained how both the UK government and Scottish government had been working on the EAW issues for quite some time. Both sides had agreed "some form of mutual co-operation should be a possibility", she added.

She said she understood the UK government had come back to her with its new proposal. For these reasons, she said at the time she had supported the plan to suspend EAW powers but said that, if anything, "the Scottish move is a good step forward but it is not too much in advance to have some co-operation with Spain, Italy and Greece."

"These three countries have the legal backing to apply for a EAW." Shaw said she would make a comment on the report published yesterday which confirmed EU law prevented her from making these comments because of her role as a member of a constitutional court which had been examining the plans for the plan to introduce Irish customs checks and other border control powers in Europe.

The debate will continue at the conference and "we don't expect a resolution now from those ministers."

Sigmira Berggrens, a member of the House of Lords who will lead the ECTR team tasked with examining the evidence, said she was "pleased that Europe may be moving in the right direction for the EAW review." But she added: "We should not expect immediate agreement between the UK and the EU on this major reform."

"I am very clear that the new proposals are flawed in a number of ways...They are far from being comprehensive...This debate continues on the issue of EAW with some UK governments working towards further integration but there is a lot of unfinished work to be done."
