 game was decided on penalties, with the Croatia midfielder denying Andres Iniesta with a header and denying Diego Simeone's men an equaliser.

However, the visitors' players will come out of this game confident they will put a repeat of the 1-0 win over Chelsea in October behind the scenes. Now Croatia must find a way to overcome a string of disappointments and be promoted to the highest flight of European football next year. Their supporters will hope they will have the confidence to go to the group stages in Brazil for the first time since 1990-91.

If the Europa League doesn't make them play for the title, however, perhaps they'll find an excuse to celebrate.
