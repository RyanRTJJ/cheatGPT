 people needing surgery and the overall increase will be a "favoured amenity to London".

The hospital said doctors could use social media with other providers to get information and help patients identify the cause, and that a number of treatments could be on their way.

As it continues its journey from one hospital to the next, the move comes on the heels of NHS England announcing the start of an initiative which will help improve patient care. It is the latest in a series of recent initiatives launched by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

A statement from the organisation said: "The Institute for Health and Care Excellence (IHCC) is dedicated to serving the needs of all patients with health conditions, as part of its mission to improve treatment and prevent further deterioration of the quality of life among the most vulnerable. The IHCC, launched in April 2016, provides healthcare professionals with personalised advice and services related to both health and people with conditions."

The IHCC has already invested £7.6m for community-based services, £3.2m of which went to hospital and community health organisations. The money will go towards a number of ongoing improvements, including a national fund to enable more people in England to use healthcare and community services. It was announced after consultation with hospitals, social care providers and senior public health authorities.

A campaign group led by NHS England is supporting the IHCC, which is part of the London borough of Greater London, as it continues its journey to increase quality of life. Visit the campaign website www.the-nouvillequeens.org.uk/nouville-veterans-visit-the-nouville-neighborhood-the-medicine. The campaign has already helped the community by supporting and supporting the IHCC's efforts for the past six months.
