Worcestershire’s batsmen added 156 runs between themselves as the two batsmen in red, George Thomas and Callum Thorp, were each successful on the second day, Thomas with two valuable half centuries and Thorp with a third-ball four.

At the end of day two, Worcestershire were still trailing by two wickets with the pitch offering a lot fewer chances.

The visitors resumed on day three with openers Lewis Gregory and Alex Gubbins at the crease, with Worcestershire having a healthy lead in scoring.

Just two overs into day three, Thomas made his way to the other end with the chance of a declaration looming.

After two boundaries and a six, Worcestershire’s captain, Will Smith, called upon his spinners, with Marcus Trescothick and Toby Roland-Jones taking the new ball.

Roland-Jones had been impressive in his first innings and he bowled with much tighter lines than on day one, keeping his length high but dropping his arm slightly.

Thomas, who had bowled in the final session of day one but bowled only eight.1 overs in total on the first two days, was left with the ball in his hand.

His first over was a great one, bringing back his left-arm spin, but the second one was much less effective and Thomas gave it away, allowing Roland-Jones to get on to his left-arm faster than Thomas was able to go right.

With a tight no-ball, Thomas was left with only a straight ball to play before it bounced, and Roland-Jones was through to break the steepling. Although Worcestershire were behind in extras, Thomas survived a tough chance at second slip on the bounce.

Two balls later Thomas was at slip trying to stop the ball, but this was a quicker ball, and the batsman couldn’t quite get his right hand up in time.

With three runs required of Worcestershire with the bat, Thomas had a fourth ball to play to take, and although he was happy to make it, a wide would have brought the game into serious doubt.
