 their use on the hotel industry is controversial, as they are often applied by guests' servants, or sprayed into public spaces without the knowledge of hotel management. To combat this and other infestation problems, a startup called Room Escape wants people to ditch the old-fashioned method of extermination. It's creating eco-friendly, bug-killing tech for hotel rooms around the world.

Room Escape, a five-year-old startup, is on a quest to create something its cofounder Adam Grier says is "much lighter than some traditional bugs" while eliminating hotel bugs’ ability to spread diseases and other nasty stuff to guests.

The startup has a patent pending on its technology, which is essentially a synthetic insecticide that, like the toxic and effective ones found at insecticide sprays, kills bugs without harming humans. A "wetting pad," the pad itself a synthetic version of natural materials like wood or cotton and treated with a special chemical, kills 99.5% of common bug bites within five minutes. After a bug bites, the adhesive on the pad is applied to the skin over where the bite has taken shape.

The pad is placed over a mosquito net (so the bugs can’t crawl through the sheet) and the whole thing is sealed in a plastic bag with a filter so the bugs can’t escape. The room then receives three hours of treatment, which according to Grier is enough to kill all the bugs it will likely encounter. The only downside to this system, Grier said, is it’s not effective against tiny bugs that live in furniture or the walls, or the more deadly giant Africanized bees.

Room Escape got its start in New York City, though the company plans to expand outside of the U.S. soon. The company is looking to partner with hotels such as the Clarion Hotel in Atlanta, or Hyatt Place in Santa Monica, so this bug-killing technology can be used in hotels around the world. The startup already has
