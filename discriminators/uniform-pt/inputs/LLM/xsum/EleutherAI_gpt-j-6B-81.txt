“This will mean thousands of vulnerable people without access to vital support from their community network”, she said.

More than £60 million has been spent on converting 26 centres – which support hundreds of people every day through activities such as swimming, fitness and crafts workshops, meals, social activity, as well as access to computers, free books and local history information, into “community hubs” which aim to engage more people in the local area.

These hubs will offer services at a discounted price with the aim of making people pay more through their council tax. The centres will all be open at a flat fee of £9.30 per person per day.

While the government says it will fund the transition of services currently provided by the centres, the scheme will still mean more than 2,000 homes will lose free swimming, childcare and family support.

A council spokesperson said the centres had been put at “significant danger”, calling the transition “a very real possibility and one we cannot simply assume will go ahead”.

“We will be taking every possible action to try and avoid it, but the risk is there and as one of the major sponsors behind these sites, we will only be paying our fair share of their running costs and, unlike the government’s scheme, will ensure their continued existence on the basis of demand.”

A Home Office spokesperson said: “This funding has no place on the council’s balance sheet and is part of a bigger picture funding decision on local services. Once the decision is made, we will be publishing a more detailed plan.”

Tameside and Glossop MP Barbara Keeley called the move a “massive attack” on people with learning disabilities.

“The people these schemes support are the victims of an epidemic of poverty, poor housing, and homelessness.”

While the centre opened in 1987, there were only 32 people on the waiting list.

The centre now has close to 100 people on the
