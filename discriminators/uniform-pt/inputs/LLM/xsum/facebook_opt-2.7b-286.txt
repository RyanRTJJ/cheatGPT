600 to Â£3m. In the following three years, the number of journeys carried out rose to 2,000 and this is where the figures start to look worrying.

Between 2013/14 and 2015/16, the number of journeys handled by private vehicles almost doubled, the Transport Research Laboratory says, rising from 5,073 to 10,938, with the cost rising from Â£3.4m to  £6.3m, and more vehicles were involved.

A new report by Professor Michael Cooper, of Leeds Metropolitan University, argues that, not only is such a scheme expensive, but it is “too vulnerable” to the changing weather conditions and risks becoming “a black hole into which taxpayers’ money flows at the slightest whim or pressure”.

Such a scheme would cost about Â£2.5m from the government a year, with an expected lifespan of about 50 years, and Â£5.5m during the first 10 years, and that would rise to Â£6m in the year 2020/21. ÂThere are currently 2,500 emergency calls taken annually. However, “given the lack of central accountability for the scheme in an emergency and the cost, it is not clear whether a major accident will have to take place to bring the scheme to an end”.

The report claims that the “vulnerability to public funds is such that a catastrophic incident may well lead to the scheme being terminated prematurely”.

Professor Cooper says: “By failing to address their own funding inadequacy, the council’s own study finds that the scheme requires a £9m investment by the authorities every year to maintain the current level of service and to cope with anticipated costs – a cost of as much as five times what the scheme actually costs in terms of use of private vehicles.

“There is of course something to be said for being able to rapidly respond to serious incidents, and indeed these are exactly the types of public service provided by schemes of this type,” he says. “But the danger arises in our having been led to believe that this is the only way in which such services can be delivered and that if it
