 youngest children attending state school had little or no chance of reaching Cambridge or King's College London (JcLP), the university where some academics are also appointed to the prestigious BSEs. The findings may have "grave implications", according to academic Mark Richardson, a leading expert on deprivation living standards and the founder of the Institute for Social Cohesion. The findings, published by researchers at the London School of Economics, suggest that poor students are left more likely to be without funding to attend prestigious universities. The study found that about a third of poorer children in England attend the top half of five colleges (Bastion, University College London and Cambridge) compared with 13 per cent in the lowest quarter, of students from two-parent households. The figures may offer an important lesson for policymakers, Richardson, director of the Institute for Social Cohesion, said.

But one study suggested that there were other factors at play. "I think we may not have to rely solely on the low-to-middle middle-class group," says Richardson. "What are the other groups doing? Are they more like poorer families than poorer pupils?" That study – which relied on a survey of parents rather than academics, though the researchers claim to have looked at research data from earlier in life – suggests that "there is more variation between families", while other research, based on interviews with young people and their parents, found no link between wealth and success. And another study from the US – published in 2012 – found that there was a link between wealth and education performance. It found for example that students from wealthier parents had better grades and were more likely to take vocational or technical courses than poorer students. But Richardson says it's worth pointing out that education should have been an aim for higher-income parents too, because this would be the best place for their child to go. The study authors point out that poverty can have different, but important, consequences. This highlights that social policies must be based on a careful weighing of all the different aspects of one's poverty and its impact on children from different background groups.
