aghan Memorial Library are collaborating to produce Ballyshannon: The Last Battle to be a part of the new exhibit at the Monaghan Memorial Library and the Craigavon Museum Services exhibition.

A story about real-life heroes

The Ballyshannon story, by the storytellers, is a history of heroism by men with British and Ulster Irish ancestry, told by the men and women who gave their lives serving in this war.

The story takes place over 13 battles, with the bulk of the fight on the Eastern front of the conflict.

It tells of the role that ordinary and unlikely individuals like John Loughal, John Byrne and O'Brien played in the battle, the bravery and sacrifice made by those who remained behind and that of the many who died during the fight.

These brave young men fought with the First World War branch of the IRA. The men they represent were part of a group called the Special Reserve Force, which was formed at the height of the war. They came from all over Britain but represented all counties.

Ballyshannon has been written and is being exhibited in the Monaghan Memorial Library – at £25 admission, there are currently 6,000 copies of this book.
