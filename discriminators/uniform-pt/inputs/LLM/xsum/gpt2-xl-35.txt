 the idea of "britain" had been discussed before in other countries.

He said: "For some time in the last century there was a movement to define it as British or British-looking. For example, the concept of what constitutes a national costume was quite fluid during that time and not always agreed on throughout Europe.

"Another term of abuse - one I have come across - was "british-looking"; this was used to describe any person of a Northern European appearance with a high sense of Britishness.

"The question for the committee is what does that mean? Is it defined by a geographical location, with any geographical location being a particular part of Britain, or is it restricted to the territory of this country?

"The phrase "British-looking" suggests that people of a particular ethnic or national background will have a particular kind of relationship with this country - this will, as it were, define their citizenship.

"The term "British-looking" has never been used in this country by anyone. We have never set about defining the term "British-looking".

"The words "British-looking" are still not in use because there is a concern that the process will be misinterpreted and any definition of citizenship will be read out of context."

A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said: "This issue has been debated for some time. The Prime Minister's views on this have not changed.

"He did raise this issue on a number of occasions, but he opposed any changes. We are not looking for new citizenship requirements, but a fairer system of citizenship, so that people with a British-looking background are not disadvantaged."

Conservative MP John Baron made a statement to the House of Lords on the issue yesterday. He told them a move to redefine British citizenship "would be a dangerous experiment".
