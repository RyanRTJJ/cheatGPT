ying land behind other houses) is an expensive way of making extra money, especially if you're selling your produce to other farmers.

The paper by the University of Leeds's economics professor, Simon Burrows, is not an entirely unexpected revelation, because since 2002 his team have been looking at the effects of building houses on food prices. It is the first time this has been done by scientists within the economics profession. Burrows's team's estimates suggest that if every family who lived in a household had built a house as a child it would have produced £1.40 in income for every £25 in food bills.

For some food producers it has caused difficulties but also benefits. For others it has produced little or no effect. It suggests whether or not we should invest in the technology for houses is not quite as simple as you might think. "We have to think that for any household to get the benefits of the land it will need to build houses on all the land that it has - this would be a significant and potentially substantial investment as a land value."

At the moment the vast majority of land - around 15% - is owned by small farms in most of the UK, and is therefore suitable for large farms like Cargill's Peabody cheese factory on the North Yorkshire/Liverpoolshire border. But more and more of that land has fallen from use because it is under pressure from urban sprawl and is increasingly difficult or impossible to own.

As a result some of those lands are being turned to farming. The report says: "The majority (55%) of new land in UK in 1990 was built to produce foodstuff. But that share has increased to over 70% following building on farmland.

"The most visible impact of building houses was in areas where house and plant and land value values were closely connected, such as the Cramlington, Dewsbury and Oldham areas of Lancashire, which experienced very rapid growth in their agricultural production, whilst housing use in this area increased quickly".

According to the university's figures, about two percent of UK households currently own a house, compared with 4.7% in 1995. The paper estimates that those
