 It came after the 26-year-old had won a unanimous decision over Michael Adler in their last fight March 1, 2007, the second of one of the marquee fights in the WBC's history.

Since signing with WBC in 2012, Indongo has won 15 of his 21 fights.

At the top of my list is a knockout over the now-soulless Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone, who has the advantage of being in his home country. In his last outing against the Los Angeles native, there was a 10-9 split decision win, although it was disputed after a 10-minute time out.

WBO champion Sergey Kovalev (32-0, 20 KOs) has no recent victories but once he is eligible to fight, this bout with Terence Crawford should be good, especially since both men will be 32 and they are not as young as Johnson (30) versus Adler (23). The former lightweight champion fought only for the IBF title in 2013 and lost to Gennady Golovkin by decision. He fought only once for the WBO title in 2011.

Kovalev, 32, who will be the WBO champion in Nov. 22, has never been stopped by a world champion. It should help his case that he will be in his home country this time as he is in the prime of his career (33-0, 22 KOs) after last fighting for a world title back in 2006. On that occasion, George Groves (37-0, 32 KOs) stopped the Russian and has won seven straight. Groves also defeated Antonio Margarito (36-5-2, 28 KOs) in just 21 seconds in 2014 and was the defending WBA/IBF champion. Johnson is just 18-1 with six knockouts, which is good enough for Nos. 2 and 3 but worse than many top fighters of his era.

Another intriguing fight that you may see at a super middleweight is junior middleweight titleholder Danny Garcia, who looks to get into the bout for the world title with WBA super middle and middleweight champion Miguel Cotto. Garcia, 21, has three knockouts in his last 4 fights -- all by knockout.
