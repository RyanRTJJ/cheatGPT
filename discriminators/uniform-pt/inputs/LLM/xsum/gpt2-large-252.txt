As she is beaten and raped by the colonel, Ruth realizes no one can protect her from what happened and eventually kills him. Now, a US woman who was raped by a Liberian rebel named George, who is now in hiding in New Mexico, tells her story to the rest of the world. The show's success, along with the recent success of American dramas on HBO, may mark the beginning of a trend for more American films and shows of foreign creators to come to the States.

The play will be in the New York City region. It is to be directed and produced by John Ridley, whose play, The Night Shift starring Tim Heidecker has been touring. Ridley's company is currently developing American dramas for HBO, including The Americans.

The cast and crew of The Night Shift have been making the rounds in New York City and beyond, including a surprise appearance at the Tribeca Film Festival.

"The Night Shift marks an exciting new and exciting step in HBO's ambitious plan to bring a fresh, cutting-edge drama to the Tribeca Film Festival.
