 She was aged 53.

Her death made the list of the 100 most admired women in Britain and the other 13 were born in Britain. Mrs Johnson was not allowed to celebrate her 50th birthday in London this week, and she was buried in a private funeral in Sydney.

Although Mrs Johnson had an interest in music, she was more interested in women's issues. She campaigned for greater voting rights, but was also successful fighting the passage of the 1852 Women's Franchise Bill.

She was a long-living woman, and lived in London until her death. The Queen, who ruled from 1951 until 1999, is the only member of Britain's royal family to die alone.

Born on November 29 1913 in London to Andrew and Victoria Johnson and his wife, Lelia Johnson, Alice also had four brothers. Her older brothers were William, Cecil and James, while her younger brothers were Henry and William, who married for a second time in 1951.

She was a well-respected member of the Victorian establishment and was the daughter by her first husband of William Hamilton, one of the most influential lawyers of the Victorian era, and Charles Augustus Steuart, the first British Prime Minister. Her father was also her uncle.

Her death was widely mourned in London and New Zealand, where she had spent the last three years of her life.

"I've seen a lot of people killed, and I've hardly seen Alice," said her brother Cecil, who is now aged 106.

"She was quite a nice lady, but, no, she wasn't violent. I think she may have had a little bit of temper," Cecil added.

"She was a very nice person, but it was a very sad loss. She was just an intelligent, wonderful young lady," Cecil said.

A memorial service at St. Paul's Cathedral was attended by both Prince Charles and Ms Johnson's husband, Lord Alfred Milner Sir Edwin Herbert.
