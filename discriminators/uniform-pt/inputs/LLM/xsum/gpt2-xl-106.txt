 from Spain, Italy, and Holland in the wake of the Paris attacks. The measures for cabin doors have been set to be made permanent.

There was no clear cause for the ban, but it was suggested that the fact that people's laptops are often stashed inside their cases during boarding could be causing safety concerns. Another possible reason? The potential for an explosion while unattended in an unsecured area of the plane.

However, a European spokesman told Sky News that the ban has now been cancelled for flights to the US. The decision was made after the US Department of Homeland Security confirmed its decision.

In Belgium, Prime Minister Charles Michel asked Brussels' airport authority not to prohibit laptops from flights. "Our security authorities need to take into account all possible risks to people's safety before taking security measures, particularly in the public spaces," he said in June, according to Reuters.

While the move to ban electronics hasn't yet become public knowledge, it seems like it was made public this week.

The ban has also been made official in the US as an airline regulation - that's pretty much as big of an endorsement as you could ask for. Of course, other countries have differing regulations on such bans, some even banning passengers from using mobile phones while on board. However, there hasn't actually been a big number of instances like this where passengers have been banned from electronic devices on board.

It also comes as no surprise that in the wake of the US election, and following the recent attacks in Brussels, EU countries have been looking at ways to make air travel less appealing than it was in the past. That means cutting down on the amount of time allowed in some of these planes for planes to be on the ground during an emergency and even forcing some airlines to charge fees for extra cabin space.

So, while we're happy to have the decision reversed, perhaps for now we'll just all agree the safest way of traveling is to take our laptops in hand if
