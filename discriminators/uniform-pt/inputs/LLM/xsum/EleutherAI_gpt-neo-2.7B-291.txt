Researchers in Ireland took human cells and genetically modified them so they produced the protein that makes the cells move. They exposed the cells to onion juice so the juice would dissolve the cells.

When the cells were placed next to sections of the human heart, the heart beat to the rhythm of the music.

Researchers in Brazil made human embryonic stem cells into mice that were capable of beating as fast as those in the wild.

In 2001, Irish researchers genetically altered a species of fish to be a fish with human heart abnormalities. The research team used genes to repair the organs and increase the fish's endurance and swimming speed.

In 2007, researchers in South Korea engineered a strain of chicken to develop in the same way that they developed into pouters for soup shops.

And in Japan, scientists discovered how a single genetic switch could trigger both the ability to reproduce and the development of human organs from animal cells.

"It just feels like it's been happening all our lives," said Andrew Pask, who studies human genetic engineering at Imperial College London. "We can't really believe how much we have already discovered about human beings."

There were 10,000 papers published in genetics last year, a rise of 3%.

One of these papers is one of the most significant. The most important paper was written by Francis Collins, the director of the Human Genome Project, in 1990, and the other significant paper is by the Japanese team led by Keiko Uchimura, who shared the 2007 Nobel prize.

"A significant fraction" of the literature on genetics is "a waste of time", says James Watson, the author of the 1993 paper and a co-discoverer of the double-helix structure of DNA at the University of California, Berkeley.

"The fact that some areas of genetics still remain uncharted does not mean that they have not been done," he said. "Some people have done it. It is just not in the journals."

These findings have not really attracted much attention because they were published in obscure
