 Unemployment had decreased from 18.4% in November, when the number was last counted, and we were expecting the number to fall further in December.

The report also said unemployment was falling, and some measures showed a recovery had taken place.

But there were a series of warnings given over the weekend. The main one is that the rise in unemployment is a short-term one at present.

Over the longer term unemployment is a long-term issue unless we take steps to reduce it.

There was more to come - it said the UK economy was strong and in good health.

Analysis

What we have here is a combination of figures and news statements that are confusing as to the direction that the UK labour market is heading. There is a real risk we could be left with a mixed picture where we have a mixed balance of jobs and unemployment.

If unemployment is rising, as the statistics show as a percentage of the workforce, then there is an assumption that the level of jobs available is also rising.

All the figures show a rise in part-time, casual, self-employment, and long-term unemployment - indicating there are more people out of work than there are full time jobs available. So I could be looking at three completely different measures of unemployment.

If true, this suggests that the labour market may be stabilising or having a short-term negative reaction to changes in the economic environment.

However, if the reality is that job growth is starting to outstrip other sectors of the economy like construction and manufacturing, and that is affecting the availability of jobs, then one of the main assumptions that has underpinned the figures - that the UK economy is strong and in good health - looks incorrect.

If the labour market is starting to stabilise, and people are losing their jobs but jobs are being created elsewhere, this would indicate that we may have seen some positive economic growth but that growth may have been masked
