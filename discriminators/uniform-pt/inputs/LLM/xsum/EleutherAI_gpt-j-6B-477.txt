 said about 180 train drivers and guards took part in the strike, although there are no plans for further walkouts. The union says it will now be up to Prime Minister Theresa May to reach a deal within the so called “Impossible 30” days deadline.

The Department for Transport (DfT) was closed on Monday and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said he was “disappointed” the strike had taken place but that the government was committed to working with the union to avoid a further disruption to services.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ve a clear set of proposals for the RMT to make some changes to, to increase the safety of drivers”.

“We want to work with the union to bring an agreement back to our industry that works first of all for our rail passengers.”

Passengers are still stranded

Speaking about the strike, which is going on for a fourth day, Mr Cash said: “The RMT is absolutely committed to working with the Department for Transport and the government to try and bring this dispute to an immediate and satisfactory conclusion.”

“The RMT has set a 30-day deadline for the department and the government to get a final deal done with us to get to a deal that will make a difference for our passengers and at the same time deliver for our members who want a fair deal.”

Passenger groups claimed on Monday more than four million people had missed journeys as a result of the strike.

“We’re talking about thousands and thousands of passenger journeys that are going to be lost as a result of the strike,” London and national director of consumer group Fairer Trains Campaign, Ian Michael, says.

“People are being pushed into taking cars instead of travelling by rail.”

He added: “There are people travelling across cities and even from south Wales to London and the south coast.

“The trains are being used as cattle cars.”
