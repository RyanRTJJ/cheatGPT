Shift workers are more likely than those who do the same job at a regular time to have heart disease, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, diabetes, and other complications, say Dr. Alan Wender, of the Institute for Work and Health at Sheffield University, and colleagues.

Shift work has a similar impact on other disorders, too, the team found.

Shift workers have a greater chance of experiencing depression, insomnia, digestive problems (such as constipation), back pain, kidney disease, and a reduced immune system response to infections and bacteria, says Dr. Wender.

"Work is a stressor that causes people to get stressed, to become anxious," says Dr. Wender; the increased workload, not the physical act of being in bed at an early hour, is what triggers the stress. Shift workers are also more prone to cardiovascular diseases, he says.

Shift workers have lower levels of physical activity compared with those who do the same job at a regular time.

"Shift workers don't get around very easily and when they do it's with fewer days off," says Dr. Wender. "It's an important thing for companies to know when they are hiring."

Shift work and sleep deprivation have been linked to obesity, depression, and even cancer. According to the National Institutes of Health, these two factors together are contributing more than $200 billion in health care costs each year. A number of studies, including other recent work, also point to a connection between shift work and cancer.

One 2010 study of more than 40,000 people published in the journal Pediatrics reported that those who reported shifting shifts at least once a week had twice the risk of cancer among women than those who didn't shift; among men, it was seven times greater.

Sleep deprivation may be even more pronounced in night shift workers, says Dr. Wender.

"Sleep deprivation leads to inflammation and the inflammation increases the likelihood of cancer," says Dr. Wender.

Even if shift work itself doesn't cause cancer, he adds, working around the clock, especially if irregular hours are forced on you, can have a significant effect.
