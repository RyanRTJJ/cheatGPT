 principal executive, responsible for ensuring the public's rights and freedoms are upheld when it comes to everything from law to the land. Her nomination was formally announced during an evening ceremony sponsored by the Liberal party on the steps of Rideau Hall.

The announcement about the new role comes a day after Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin announced she was the Conservative Party's leader in Quebec.

Ms Payette declined an invitation to attend the ceremony. But she made clear she had no intention of stepping down and would not seek re-election to her position until she leaves office.

"I take my responsibility and I have a wonderful job and I don't want to let anyone down," she said. "I want to work and raise my children and continue working at the highest level as soon as possible to make sure this country continues its path forward and to continue to respect women and the rights of every member of our nation."

Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard denounced her nomination as a "provocation."

"The Liberal Party has recognized that no other official can fulfill such a key role in the development of Quebec," said the premier, Jean Charest. "The leadership of the government has always been and will continue to be at the core of the Canadian identity."

Ms Payette is the son of former leader Pierre Trudeau and father of Mr Trudeau's daughter, Sophie. Ms Payette was once considered the favourite to replace Quebec Premier Pauline Marois who announced she was a "no" candidate. But the former Conservative leader chose to endorse his son.

"I know this government will continue as a responsible member of parliament and minister of the Crown for the people," he said. "This is a proud moment for this government, for Quebec and for my political family."

Quebec Premier Jean Charest says Canadian politics has changed and he plans to work with Ms Payette "on behalf of the entire Canadian public and the great Quebec people." (Jacques Boissinot/Canadian Press)
