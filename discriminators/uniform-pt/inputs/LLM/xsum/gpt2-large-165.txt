 revealed that two pieces of furniture at the resort cost £24 while at the same time the UK was being offered at least £100 for a trip abroad.

The study concluded: "We believe that one cannot be certain about the quality of goods. This means that we must be extremely discerning in making purchases, as prices may reflect quality or quality content. The higher prices for some items also implies higher levels of social desirability for the products."

Professor Ian Dunbar, deputy director of the Centre for the Study of Living Standards at Queen Mary University of London, told the Guardian: "While it is great to see that people who travel abroad and spend some time overseas and learn about the culture there still want cheaper goods – if we cannot be sure how we are valued within their culture, and can't trust their value to us – this is a very expensive gamble.

"We might as well be paying the same price as we will every other time we go somewhere in the UK – and buying it in the hopes we will get some sort of social good.

"The cost of a one-year holiday in Europe or South America in the UK must be worth it.

"A trip to Ibiza, for instance, is a relatively cheap way to find out whether Britain is on the rise or an economy struggling to create jobs."

He added: "The problem is that the prices of some of the things we buy is what is perceived to be the social 'value' and as much of an issue as if some of the products we buy are inferior.

"It is about whether we think the item has social value – are we trying to show off our wealth or are we just being frugal?"

Dunbar's research found the average price to buy one pint of champagne at the Louvre in Paris in 2011 was £15 whilst it cost £29 for a one-year wine-tasting holiday in Italy.

Meanwhile the cheapest trip in Europe, in the form of a night's stay in a country town, was around £130 while in South America it took the same price.
