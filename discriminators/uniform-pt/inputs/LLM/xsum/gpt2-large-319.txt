 get their home visits timed with the family's busy work and school hours, setting up "no-worry" advice around self-care and increasing the amount of home care people can receive over their term of stay.

The figures, which come from the latest NHS Digital Health research, come amid concerns health chiefs are ill-equipped to deliver improvements to services during the recession and the winter of 2012 onwards. The Nuffield Trust has compiled a list of the health service's five most pressing problems – including the "crisis of care" highlighted by the recent BMA survey – and found a "dearth of leadership" among public health leaders.

In the BMA's online survey of 5,400 employers in the UK, more than a third of those questioned said they had faced delays in providing advice to prospective workers about the new NHS national services. One in three said the health service had "lost focus" on its "most vital policy".

NHS Digital Health said its survey had found that patients were "disappointed" with the service "at an alarming rate".

A spokesperson said: "There are significant challenges facing the NHS. There is a need to improve care and enable the health service to deliver the best possible service for our patients. This report shows that there is a significant lack of leadership in the NHS.

"A lack of leadership in the NHS could undermine trust in our NHS, which in turn could undermine our ability to deliver the best possible care to patients."

The figures in the survey on public perceptions of the NHS came from a range of organisations including the BMA, Ofsted, NHS England and the Office for National Statistics.

NHS Digital Director Professor Clare Gerada said: "At NHS Digital, we continually work with all stakeholders to help improve services to patients.

"People are concerned that there are too many unnecessary services, which can lead people to leave the NHS when they can't afford them."

NHS Digital said that, since 2008, staff from at least eight different NHS Digital Health networks around the country had worked on the NHS Digital Health Network – its "key performance indicators" (KPIs) to test how the service is performing in terms of delivering NHS-wide KPIs to health practitioners.
