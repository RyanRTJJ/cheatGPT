 of a calf injury and Moussa Dembélé could also be doubtful if he is unavailable.

New striker Danny Rose has been sent off to Burnley (second to goal) for a technical after a foul on Stoke captain Paul Robinson.

Leicester manager Nigel Pearson said: "I know it's disappointing but it's very disappointing. The players played very well and it's not fair to lose a player when there is no time. We need to show a lot more respect to the players.

"We need to win some trophies and maybe win some games and that's a pretty important thing. But I think there's no doubt that, especially given it's the first two games of the Championship campaign, Leicester will be determined to win as many games as they can. But it shows everybody is going to try to do the best they can."

Premier League side Leicester, who are in control of the match between Chelsea and Manchester United, held on to a 2-2 draw after the restart at Stamford Bridge.

Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino added: "I'm happy with what that performance did for us but it was so frustrating because it's not the type of performance we have had this season. We wanted to bring quality but it was not the right way to go about it and we don't like the way we've played.

"It was disappointing but our aim is not a little bit disappointed but there's good players who can win trophies. The pressure is on the players to come up with more and that's why we want to give our players an opportunity to show what they can be."
