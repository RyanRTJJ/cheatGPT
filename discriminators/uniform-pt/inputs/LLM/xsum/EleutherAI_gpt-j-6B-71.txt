 Queen Victoria, and will remain on the throne for another 20 years.

Despite her many achievements – not least of all the Diamond Jubilee Pageant, which saw the world applauding, and then applauding again when it was repeated – Her Majesty is often portrayed quite unfavourably in the media; she’s accused of trying to “impose her will” on the BBC, for example. This, plus her refusal to wear a bikini, has led to her being immortalised in countless fashion editorials – and it’s no wonder that, not a single man has married her.

The British people aren’t too bad, though, and for every newspaper article depicting Her Majesty as some horrible person who doesn’t know how to behave, someone else will publish an article showing her as a brave, loving woman – who will always remain the Monarch despite having reached the age of 90.

The monarch doesn’t like to think about her age, as far as anyone can know, but with the longest reign in British history and plenty of more stories to come, that day is fast approaching. So let’s take a look at Her Majesty during her 63 years at the throne – and if you haven’t yet taken advantage of this week’s sale on all the royal pictures on Coronet, you really should now.
