 the company is in talks to acquire the rights to The Butler, a historical drama starring Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey.

Iger said that the potential acquisition is evidence of "Disney's commitment to bring the biggest and best content to our audiences everywhere," according to Deadline. He also stressed the importance of the companyâ€™s efforts to "control as much of our destiny as possible" by putting a priority on owning content. Iger added that The Butler represents an opportunity for Disney to tap into an audience that is underserved in its current offering. 

Iger said that Disney has had its eyes on The Butler for some time, but the company had to wait for the perfect moment to make its move. He added that the company is interested in telling stories that are "underrepresented and underheard" and The Butler is a perfect example of this.

In addition to discussing The Butler, Iger also touched on Disney's acquisition of Fox earlier this year, saying the company was now "at a level of scale and power we've never had before." He also said that Disney is positioning itself to be a leader in technology, such as streaming and other new platforms. 

Iger concluded the town hall by telling employees that though much has changed in the past few months, Disney is still the same company it has always been: a place that tells stories, provides positive experiences, and creates magical moments for its fans.
