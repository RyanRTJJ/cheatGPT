 him, has taken over in his place with Massimo Cellino still at the club.

It would have been difficult for any club to match United's £300m investment, but Chelsea were able to outspend the Reds by an astounding £48m to secure the signing of Eden Hazard – a £34.8m sale. The playmaker has scored 26 league goals from the left in six seasons for Paris St Germain, with Chelsea also making additions on centre-midfield to accommodate him.

"The club has made great progress this season: four winnable leagues and two semi-finals; we now face both Liverpool and Manchester City – who will do very well with the Europa League in November and will have their own transfer budget of £180m," said Di Matteo.

"[The signing of Hazard] is a crucial signing which we have kept our promise to make. I am looking forward to working with him during pre-season and helping him develop in every aspect."

Hazard did have a couple of moments in the first Premier League encounter with the Reds, firing Chelsea's only goal in a 1-1 draw that lasted less than three half-an-hour.

"In addition to the goals, he also did well with his work in the box during my time in Stamford Bridge," Di Matteo added. "He was good in the air and he showed great concentration in the final third."

Ahead of Champions League qualifying, the Blues are looking to make a splash by pursuing new signings. The news of Hazard's £40m switch is likely to raise hopes that the club are seeking to up their interest in the Senegal midfielder Moussa Sissoko, who joined Tottenham Hotspur just 12 months ago.

Chelsea finished as runners-up to City to reach the last eight of the Champions League, but have lost on penalties three times this season in four attempts.
