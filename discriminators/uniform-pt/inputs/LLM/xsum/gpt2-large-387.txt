The figures for London show some of the most dramatic improvement of almost two decades. From 1981, when just 14 officers were posted, to 2017 there have been a cumulative increase of 18,000 over the 14-year period.

The most noticeable improvement is seen in policing for cyclists, which has more than doubled to a recent high of 1,600 officers, up from 400. For vehicle-related offences, the increase is almost three times worse, with 2,800 officers on bicycles in 2017, up from 1,100 three years ago.

The most recently published figures for London show 2,460 cyclists and pedestrians per day on London's roads, nearly 200 fewer than in 1985.

This fall was mainly offset by the increase in the number of drivers caught doing things other than driving, including overtaking or overtaking dangerously, overtaking or riding too close to another vehicle or cycle, and going too slowly to meet safety standards.

TfL said it would work with councils to increase the number of cyclists on their roads.

"This is good news for cycling, especially in the crowded boroughs of London, where cyclists are facing increasing numbers of dangerous drivers on the roads every day but also for London's businesses and residents because of the huge impact cycling makes to their livelihood and to jobs, homes and schools in the capital."

The numbers come from Transport for London's London Cycling Campaign.

There are other things cycling campaigners object to about the figures. Some say it shows a lack of effort on their side of town, while some think the figures come from unofficial sources.

An TfL spokesman said: "These statistics show that cycling remains the fastest-growing form of
