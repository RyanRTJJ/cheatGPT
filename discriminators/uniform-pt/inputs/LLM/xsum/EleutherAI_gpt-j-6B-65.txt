But the woman said it was still unclear why police had been called to the apartment.

"There is no obvious motive," she told reporters at the scene.

"We do know that there are things missing and that her purse was not in the apartment. And that it certainly was not an abduction," she said. "But it's still so early. It's just so very early", she said. "We don't know what happened inside the apartment," she said.

Her body was discovered in her second-floor apartment by her assistant, who was cleaning the place for the weekend.

Scott, 31, told CNN that her friend had
