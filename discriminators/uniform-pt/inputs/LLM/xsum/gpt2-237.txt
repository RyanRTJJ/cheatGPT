 cyberwarfare in a developing nation is difficult to pin down — some suggest foreign interference is a legitimate concern. But there are two obvious possibilities. One is that China controls much of the internet infrastructure itself. If so, it is able to access the sites and control the systems that underpin our current, most secure internet—an activity that many American companies and individuals find intolerable.

The second possibility is that those Chinese hackers that did this, like the Chinese state-run CCTV and the Russian state-run Dnipropetrovsk Internet Agency, run systems that, by their very nature, aren't very secure.

"There are a lot of things that I fear about cyberintelligence. Sometimes when it is reported, people don't know who was working on it, etc.," says Hamed, the founder of "Hacking the Net: How We Lost Our Social Media" group, a website that has tracked and disseminated information about various cybercriminal groups.

"This can be devastating. It's extremely disturbing."

Hamed has started a project titled "Showing the Information", as a way to try and find that elusive, unknown, piece of information. In particular, he has used the "information of interest", which he says shows the extent to which the Chinese state is able to manipulate, infiltrate private networks via data-sharing arrangements and "spying".

Some people have also said the information may show a major attack on American institutions. The information has been circulating online and the US Senate has demanded that any information on the attack being reported be destroyed. This is a major test of the US government's ability as an intelligence, not cyber-interventionist power, Hamed explains.

What if, for example, the Chinese government saw an opportunity to hack US military intelligence systems? It could use that information to launch an attack on our country's entire defense apparatus. The attack on American personnel would likely show that the Chinese government has a strategic interest in keeping American troops in line. If the US government knew our military was being
