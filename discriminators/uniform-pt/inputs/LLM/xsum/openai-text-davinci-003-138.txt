 police at the crime scene in Toronto's Chinatown neighbourhood.

Liuâ€™s family and supporters say officers used excessive force against the man, who suffered from schizophrenia, before shooting him dead. They argue that police failed to adequately consider the mental state of the man, who may have been looking for help, when they entered his home.

Protests erupted in the neighbourhood shortly after the shooting. The Ontario police watchdog is currently investigating the incident and will release a report with the findings. 

The death of Liu Shaoyo has shocked the Chinese-Canadian community, and angered many members who feel that the police response was unjustified and that greater consideration should have been given to the possible mental health issues of the man. The death of Liu Shaoyo has raised important questions surrounding police use of force and how they interact with people with mental health issues, particularly members of the immigrant community. Liu's family, who were contacted by police after his death, want answers and justice, but it remains to be seen what the outcome of the investigation will be. In any case, the death of Liu Shaoyo has been profoundly felt in Toronto and will no doubt linger in the consciousness of the city for a long time to come.
