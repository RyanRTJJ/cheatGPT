Rape Crisis Scotland works to provide a confidential, non-judgmental and safe space for survivors of rape, sexual assault and child sexual abuse. They provide emotional and practical support, counselling and advice, as well as education and campaigning on the issue. The money will allow them to expand their work and ultimately support more victims.
