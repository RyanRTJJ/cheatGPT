The two incidents came just two days after two policemen were killed in a suspected suicide attack, also with a rifle in Nahr-e Saraj district.

In the latest incident, a car bomb exploded with two others and the car burst into flames during a military parade before security forces quickly stormed the place in the Kamaat area of Nahr-e Saraj district of Nablus.

On Friday, the army chief of staff Mohammad Ali Shahin condemned a number of security incidents in the southern city of Nahr-e Saraj, following a blast which left five soldiers dead, said Ali Hamdani, spokesman of the army's Quds Force.

Our troops will face their battles, but they should never be allowed to be used as a cover in any war," he was quoted as saying by local media.

No group claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack on the troops near the Nablus border.

The security situation in the area has been deteriorating for a long time. In the 1960s, an attack against the Baghlan village was reported several times, but never materialized. The worst happened for seven years ago, when two soldiers in a Special Forces regiment were killed when a suicide bomber detonated homemade explosives near the village entrance.

We all monitor the situation closely," the deputy chief of security and intelligence at the Ministry of Defense told Al-Monitor.
