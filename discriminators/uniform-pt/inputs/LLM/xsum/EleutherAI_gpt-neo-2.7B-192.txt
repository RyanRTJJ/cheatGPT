 were still being pulled from the sea by military and navy vessels.

"The response has been overwhelming and incredible in a way I've never experienced before," Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said.

The search and rescue agency said so far 542 people on board the ship were accounted for.

The search was being extended to Friday after "somewhere at sea," Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.

"What we can confirm with a very high degree of confidence is that there is a life raft, that there are some bodies there, but I would say until the (ship) reaches land then it simply is not known where all the bodies are," ship safety officer Wayne Tompkins told a news conference.

Most passengers and crew were Vietnamese and there were about 300 passengers and 55 crew, but Tompkins did not know how many people were on the boat from China to Indonesia.

The passenger who tried to board the life raft last week was rescued by the Japanese coast guard, which says a "number of people are missing."

Earlier, the rescue agency said there was concern that it could have been a pirate ship that had been attacked in international waters in the Indian Ocean over the weekend.

Australian Maritime Safety Authority chairman Mike Smith said a security assessment was now being carried out of the area following the incident.

"But whatever happened to the ship could easily have changed things from an investigative point of view," Smith said.

Australia, New Zealand and Japan all have anti-piracy operations in the area, but Australian authorities suspect pirates may have struck at a rival vessel.

The captain of the missing vessel "is cooperating with investigators," Smith said.

Japan issued a statement saying two crew members "are safe and healthy after being rescued by the Japanese Coast Guard from the missing passenger vessel "Mekong River."

China said it had dispatched a "joint staff team" to the search area to help with the rescue effort. Australia's Prime Minister Turnbull has called for the deployment of Chinese coast guards to aid the search and rescue operation.

Tompkins said the ship was the largest in the fleet.

"It may be a different ship but it's a very big, very big ship. We'll know
