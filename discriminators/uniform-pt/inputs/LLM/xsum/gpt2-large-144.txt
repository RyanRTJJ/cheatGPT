 and Clyde confirmed that there was a mistake but they did add that everything would be fine once the problems were fixed.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said their internal investigation found no evidence to suggest the hospital had mishandled the dust.

The hospital has faced widespread criticism following the discovery of the contamination, which has been referred to the independent Scottish inquiry into the accident.

However, NHS Scotland said the inspectors had checked procedures and had found no signs that the dust was harmful to staff, patients or the public.

"Following this inspection NHS Scotland has begun an independent investigation into the incident," a spokesman said. "The incident is under investigation to ensure that there's no risk to anyone or the public.

"Following this, the health and safety of patients and staff will be of paramount importance to the trust. That will be confirmed in the next few weeks in relation to those patients who were affected by the initial exposure."

An Independent Borders spokeswoman said the hospital was fully co-operating with NHS Scotland's independent review of the incident.

"The health and safety of patients and staff in our Care Scotland sites is a core value and we take this very seriously at the Hospital of North East Scotland and at all of our affiliated NHS Care Scotland sites.

"Whilst we cannot comment on any specific investigation, we would like to stress that we are fully co-operative and will review all aspects of the investigation," she added.

The discovery was confirmed on July 10, by a specialist group called the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, which led the inspections.

The NHS was notified, but the local authority said at the time it decided not to have an independent investigation to determine whether there was any cause for alarm.

"NHS Scotland was not contacted by the police or Fire Brigades Scotland until after the inspectors had left," the NHS said in its statement.
