 worked as advertised in treating wounds. They gave it a "very very" cautious report.

And last month, researchers using the same technique, published a short article titled: "The use of onion powder for wound healing: A case report in a Turkish soldier". The piece also concluded that "one must not interpret these results as proof that onion powder is effective at all times of the year."

The results are important, considering how widely used onions are. As Gwyneth Jones wrote in her piece in the Sunday Times, "As well as being enjoyed as an everyday vegetable, onions are also used to make soup, sandwiches, salad dressing, and sauces. They may also be used to cook foods such as chips and tandoori chicken."

The story goes on to state that the only reason why onion has such success for wound treatment is because of its unique ingredients.

Now, it seems that some of those same ingredients have come together to make a new product called "Ginger Glands".

The "product" was created in May by two medical researchers, Mark D. P. Mattson, from the University of Maryland; and A. J. Dhillon, from the University of Texas Medical Branch, who were frustrated by the lack of scientific studies of the remedy for wound care.

The team of two created two ingredients, two capsules. They wanted to find a "magical elixir" to help with wounds and other conditions where ingredients are "non-intuitive." For example, they noted, the body needs to absorb the nutrients you give it. But what happens when your body is deficient or there are too many toxins or pathogens present?

At first glance, the ginger extracts seem to be just about as good as plain onions in aiding with wound conditions. There aren't many studies that support this claim, however, so the researchers thought they would find some way to test it out. However, they couldn't find any other products out there that use ginger in the way they wanted. So they took matters into their own hands and began
