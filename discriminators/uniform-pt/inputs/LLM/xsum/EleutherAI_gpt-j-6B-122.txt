 rape the last woman once he was given her drink. Derby's gangland has been rocked since Khatkar was shot through his window and his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Shabana, was murdered by Khatar's sidekick, Sajid Anwar. Khatkar survived the shooting in a taxi and despite being found at the scene of Shabana's murder, the judge decided against an evidence law application...

Khatkar (46) who is a former member of the notorious Mungalwadi gang, raped and sexually assaulted women living in different areas in the town.

He had made a number of visits to the town and had visited a friend's house in the Burtcha area in the town. Khatkar had raped two of the women at Burtcha.

He was arrested at Derby railway station, walking on the tracks away from Shabana's flat at 3.50am

Det Insp Nick Egan said: "This is one of the few cases in Derbyshire that we have been able to catch in the act.

"The gang's influence and the lack of action taken by the gang on these types of crimes has led to an increase in the number of assaults in Derby.

"Khatkar was involved in these crimes and has shown no remorse for his actions. All of the women were victims and are shocked at the way they were treated.

"We are determined to put this violent thug behind bars where he belongs."

Shabana, who lived in an estate near to Derby station, was shot dead at the start of this year in her front garden.

Neighbours say she was pregnant with Khatkar's child. Shabana's funeral is taking place today at 12.30pm at the Rivett and Derby Muslim Centre in Derby's Mafan area.

I can imagine their relationship was a rather 'tempestuous' but I think that all gangland crimes will always be about 'honour' and control, they don't care much for money in the short term, just the fact that you have disrespected the gang. It's a very tribal concept so when
