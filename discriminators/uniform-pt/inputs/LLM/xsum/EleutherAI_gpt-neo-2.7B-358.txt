 plane will be allowed to take flight - and no time frame has been given, either. "As soon as the FAA certifies the airplane, it will be fully ready to takeoff," said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation consultant and professor at Northwestern University. "But that can take a long time and cost a lot of money."

As we write this article, however, the FAA is in the process of approving the plane for takeoff - and once that happens, it is expected to be a relatively cheap and short flight, Mr Aboulafia said. However, when that happens and the plane is formally accepted by the FAA, Boeing will have a month or so to prepare for flight, and during that period it wants to be "prepared to meet regulatory requirements as quickly as possible," the company said.

In another sign of the delays, the FAA is not currently granting Boeing's request to fly the 787 from its headquarters near Chicago to Phoenix - Mr Aboulafia said Boeing intends to use a Boeing 777 to fly from Denver to the northern New Mexico city of Albuquerque. Boeing intends to hold a press conference about the Phoenix flight on Thursday, he said. The 787 is considered more of an evolutionary "baby killer" than an outright "genetic killer" - and it is expected to cost at least $6 billion to make, Mr Aboulafia said. However, he added: "For every one dollar you spend, you've got to lose $5." That means the development, testing and certification of the plane will be $100 million to $200 million, in total, he said.

The Boeing 787 was designed to be a "genetic" death sentence for modern commercial airliners, say some of the people behind the plane for airlines who will be running it. If the aircraft could find a niche between a $US100,000 and $US200,000 (about $A93,000 and $A183,000 ) aircraft and a $US1 million dollar aircraft, then airlines would lose out on millions of
