 Scotland said: "Scotland's prescription charges are failing as a public health measure. They are not delivering the health benefits they hoped they would deliver." The Scottish Parliament passed a motion demanding a change in a year ago in order for the charges to be abolished and to instead fund services by taxing alcohol.

It is important to note that, unlike the National Health Service, which is paid directly from the UK’s general taxation system, prescriptions are publicly financed by a different mechanism known as ‘prescription charges'. This means that although the Government pays doctors, hospitals, NHS bodies and other organisations which provide medicines to give prescriptions, it does not directly pay the BMA to provide prescriptions. The only way prescription charges can be abolished in the UK is if the Scottish Parliament passes a law for the Government to do so. At present, this will not be possible under the current legislation since a change in this way is considered to be a devolved matter and therefore the Scottish Government would need to act on this and the UK Government has no option to change the legislation, as it has no powers over Scotland's laws.

Although many consider the National Health Service to be the single largest recipient of Government budget on healthcare in the UK, despite this, it does have limitations that make it vulnerable to financial pressures. For example, as a result of budget cuts, public hospitals in Scotland are being forced to spend on other services such as physiotherapy before allowing the NHS to provide free prescriptions.

The NHS is not a single service but a number of different entities, and a significant proportion of public funding is used to support the provision of services which are often beyond the scope of a hospital. These are sometimes called 'out-of-hours care services', and include local authority-provided care, rehabilitation services and social services. Funding for these services often relies on the patient being a resident of a council area.

If we are to see long-term solutions to these problems,
