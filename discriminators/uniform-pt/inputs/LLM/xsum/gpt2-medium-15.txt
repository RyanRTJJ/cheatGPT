 to attract tourists, with their intention of using the water for recreation instead of drinking.

Construction began on the project last year but stopped several months ago, due to lack of funding.

Despite being designed as a tourist attraction and funded using donations donated by visitors, the water will only be available for drinking — which the project says will prove beneficial to the local economy.

The project aims to improve water quality around the lake, but will be monitored, in order to maintain the best conditions for tourism.

Tourists would no longer be limited to water only, but would be able to sip the lake's drinking water, which will be fed by a system of pipes throughout the lake. They will be able to drink it using filters or other methods other than taking a hose and pouring into a tank at the entrance of the village.

Tourism representatives have argued that their project will draw more tourists, particularly for Galashiels and the nearby river.

"It's a massive revitalization and we feel it will be very good that it is being built," said Peter Stöckley, from Galashiels Tourism Organisation.

According to the authorities, the water will also be suitable for commercial use in the village and for residents who would like a small-sized swimming pool as that is not suitable for swimming, since it is located below. However, a water source has not yet been found.

Tourists could not pay to swim, but would still have access to the same swimming pool the local inhabitants would enjoy.

Tourist groups, which were able to pay to swim, declined to take part in the project, claiming that it was too remote and that visitors were being used for marketing purposes.

Ståle, who does not own a swimming pool or have access to local resources, is currently trying to buy some of the water that he had left to bring to the lake.

"There are only two ways I can get the water," he said. "One is we buy some from the local fishermen and the other is that we buy the lake water."

While Ståle does not want to sell the lake water yet, he
