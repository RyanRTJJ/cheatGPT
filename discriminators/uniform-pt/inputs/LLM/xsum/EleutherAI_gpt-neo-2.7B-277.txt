NOPBA President James Conroy said the police shooting “is just the latest in a long line of incidents where police officers have taken innocent bystanders’ lives simply for being white at a stoplight.” He was later joined by four other police watchdogs as NOPBA members stood in silence to protest Mr Gray’s fate.

“No innocent child dies today by the hands of a cop,” NOPBA president Mark Marion wrote on the organization’s Facebook page. “It’s time we change the way we deal with policing.”
