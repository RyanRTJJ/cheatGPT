 24% and household groceries rose 8%, the report said.

Nielsen data showed major retailers including Tesco and Amazon had achieved strong profits at a time when the UK economy had been slowing, with inflation hitting its highest rate in nearly four years.

The UK is not so different from Japan, where consumer spending growth hit a seven-year high in the April-June quarter, according to the government’s official retail data.

Nielsen said the UK’s consumer trend is not so different from its growth in Japan’s consumer spending.

“There is clearly a global trend where consumers in developed nations are still spending,” said Nielsen chief retail analyst Paul Hester. “The UK is probably not so different from Japan.”

Despite the robust sales figures, consumer confidence has weakened sharply since the referendum.

Sales at UK stores open over a year rose at their slowest rate in more than a year during August, an early sign of the slowdown in the consumer spending recovery.

Total spending at UK stores is now at its highest since October 2008, just after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and while the rate of growth has slowed since May to 4.6% in July.

However, online shopping, which has helped the UK’s retailers, increased 7% in volume last year – higher than the overall growth in sales for the first time. And e-commerce sales accounted for 3.7% of UK retail sales in May and 4.9% in June this year.

In Britain, internet sales growth is higher than in the United States, which represents one-sixth of all retail sales, and growing faster than in France, Germany and Canada, and at a faster rate than Japan.

Nielsen said online retail sales in the UK in July rose at their fastest pace in a year, helping total retail sales, which is excluding online sales, to grow 1.4% in volume month-on-month in early July, the biggest rise in seven years.
