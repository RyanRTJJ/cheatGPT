 Test squad early in the series and his one limited-overs innings last October was a quiet knock of just 32.

"After he was named in our squad for the upcoming series against India, he trained well and is in good form," Dravid said in a press release.

"He has been included in the squad on the back of his batting form at the club level. We look forward to seeing him in action. We are expecting a big improvement on his first assignment to the senior team."

Dravid, the all-time leading run-scorer for India and the leading Test wicket-taker, will retire following the series.

His final assignment will likely be playing for Gujarat Lions in a limited-overs competition where he has a good enough record to warrant an automatic place in the side.

Kohli's omission comes as a disappointment because the 30-year-old was looking to cement a first-choice opening batting position in limited-overs cricket, as well as in the longer games. Yet, he has scored nine half-centuries from 38 matches - that would have included the one against UAE in 2014-15.

Champions India will now be without their chief spinner, who has been rested for the home series against West Indies. Umesh Yadav had not figured in the one-off match against Bermuda, so the decision to rest him does not come as a surprise.

There are four spinners in the current squad - Yuzvinder Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Deep Sigh and Axar Patel. However, as a precautionary measure, there may be another spin bowler in the squad too. Axar has taken 37 wickets from 17 matches, including 9-66 against UAE and 5-56 against Sri Lanka in the recent away series. Deep and Kuldeep have been inconsistent, but still have a role to play in the side.
