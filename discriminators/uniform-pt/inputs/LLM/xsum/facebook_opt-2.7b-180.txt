 Lam's involvement poses a security risk.

Hong Kong's security chief said there was no legal basis to transfer Lam Wing Kee, who worked for a publisher that sold books critical of China's leaders. Chinese police say Lam's involvement poses a security risk.

Hong Kong officials and media have cast doubt in recent days over whether Lam can keep her job, in the aftermath of mainland China's announcement last week that it was seeking to prosecute the 52-year old. Lam's status in the financial hub is unclear.

Lam's detention was part of a wider crackdown on suspected triad gangsters in Tai Wo, a district in Hong Kong's Tseung Kwan O district, which started on March 29 and has drawn much international criticism. Police have not said which gang Lam was suspected of being affiliated with.

Lam came back to the mainland from Hong Kong after her husband's business closed down in 1993. Her father, Lam Wing Kee, who was also a bookshop owner in Tai Wo, was suspected of involvement in the Chinese military, and died in prison in 1998.

Police had no comment on Lam's father. A Hong Kong government spokesman referred questions to the Chinese authorities in Beijing.

"Any investigation or prosecution would be carried out in accordance with law... and we have no more information to share with the media, so I can't answer your questions beyond the relevant information," the Chinese Public Security Ministry said in its statement on Thursday after repeated requests by media.

Police had arrested 21 people so far on various charges including corruption, obstruction of justice, and involvement in the triad, authorities in the northern Chinese province of Inner Mongolia said in a statement last Friday.

Lam herself is the most senior official who has spoken out against the crackdown and could be considered a security threat by Beijing if she fails to respond.

It was not immediately clear on what grounds an investigation was under way into her.

The Hong Kong government said it was not officially notified about
