 decide on what action to take this year, but the matter remains on the table. This is an example of how far we have come.

What might happen to Richmond this year if the Liberal government does not take action?

"I think there can be a considerable amount of good will on both sides that may be welcomed and a lot of disappointment," said Councillor James Watson on Monday. "The Liberal government, you've got to know, has a strong record and you've got to stand up and talk about it. They did not just stop all these fires, they went through them and they've now gone through several. It's a shame for Richmond."

The Liberal leader has to speak out on this issue so the Liberals don't do it again, it has to happen at a grassroots level or they risk being removed from office and it is unacceptable. And that's where the two big parties have to be united. If they are at a table with the Premier, but they don't actually meet, it's a shame they don't meet on this issue at all and if the mayor and the leader and the councillor and the councilman and all five members of the City Council are in the minority then I think there is a very big problem out there and the mayor and his staff could put a stop to it.

There is nothing more divisive in the British-speaking world than a political party that is unwilling to talk publicly about issues and that should feel very strongly about it. That's the problem.

It's a national disgrace. If I do speak out on it I'll certainly look at the issues. That's what I need to do. I have my priorities in mind for the day. I've gone on campaign and I have three or four campaigns planned. I've had several people who I think in my constituency are having serious problems
