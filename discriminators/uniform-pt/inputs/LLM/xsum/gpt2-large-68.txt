 on the government to expand the number.

Sikanda, the senior advocate said, had also approached all other government departments to bring about more appointments and he had even suggested the Chief Minister convene a Cabinet meeting to appoint more AMs.

"We are in the process of finalising our final proposals to the Chief Minister and the Cabinet," he added.

The case for more AMs is being heard before a small judicial panel, although Sikanda will have the final say.

"It is imperative to increase the number of AMs to ensure better working conditions in the state by ensuring equal representation of females and men to the top management jobs and to ensure an effective representation of religious minorities to key decision-making positions.

"We propose to form a five-person committee with two of us, comprising of myself and another senior advocate, to recommend the number of additional judges and the positions that should fill them," he added.

Also taking up the issue was the Public Interest Litigations (PIL) cell, which is headed by Shri Sanjay Deshmukh.

Deshmukh is also an advocate. Among the nine parties participating in the PIL is the state minority cell of the Centre.

This case has not only concerned the work of judges – the state is a federal jurisdiction – but also the implementation of Article 324 of the Constitution providing for the appointment of judges on merit and on the basis of gender. The state Commission for Women has also been challenging the legality of the appointment of women AMs to the posts of Chief Justice and Chief Justice of the High Court.
