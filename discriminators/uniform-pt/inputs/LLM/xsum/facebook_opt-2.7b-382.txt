 of its own top diplomatic jobs, and a seat on the World Trade Organization. There is no comparable position for a non-EU country.

The decision to leave the EU will certainly have political and economic consequences that dwarf the divorce with Czechoslovakia. In the UK and EU terms, this is the biggest blow since 1945, and even worse: it is hard to look back at history and find such a fundamental shift, such a fundamental rupture.

In the 1950s, Europe underwent a radical demographic transformation. The first mass migration of people from the Middle East, including from North Africa and the Middle East, took place throughout the entire 1950s.

In Europe, the old social, cultural and economic order had been in place for centuries. Suddenly, large numbers of European societies, societies that were very important for the state, were unable to meet the need for work. The labour market was destroyed.

The demographic transformation of Europe began, as you may know, in the 1960s. But in the period from 1968 to 1973 there was a dramatic expansion of immigration from North Africa, the Middle East and Asia. In this phase, a group of countries which became referred to as the Third World came up to meet the labour demand.

The main countries were Iraq, Tunisia and Algeria. During the 1970s and 1980s, these three countries sent around 5,000 nationals to each European country. They wanted to work. There were a lot of unemployed people in Europe at this time. Their countries had suffered from economic shocks, and they wanted to work anywhere to get a living.

You know, the big problem with a sudden shift of this scale of migration is that it creates two or three different, competing needs. So the European population suddenly became much more heterogeneous, because these people, who want to work, found that they don't have the labour market skills that they had in their own countries.

This led to the formation of these new
