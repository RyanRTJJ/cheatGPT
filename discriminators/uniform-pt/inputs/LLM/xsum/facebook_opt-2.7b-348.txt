 thought to have fled to the lake on foot after the shootings.

They were last seen in the north of the city, where they were seen getting into a silver and white vehicle.

Police and investigators are keen to speak to anyone who was with the attackers or may have information on the men's whereabouts.

A source said the "highly placed source" of the news report - which Sky News has seen - said that "in any other western democracy where people went out to dinner after a night out with their friends there would have been protests against this".

He told Sky News that the police do not believe Salman Abedi was involved in the Manchester attack.

It comes after a witness earlier said that he saw a girl "covered in blood" running from the Manchester Arena with her head in her hands.

"That is the one thing I will never forget which was on my first day in America; walking back down the road towards the Victoria station this girl was cuffed in front of me by security," he said.

Police are also searching the town of Fallowfield, three miles (5km) from Manchester city centre, home to hundreds of properties with a history of drug dealing linked to the Muslim community.

One man has been taken into custody there.

Police have raided properties in the city of Greater Manchester, more than 20 miles (32km) away from Monday's attack.

They have arrested a 22-year-old man and a 33-year-old man on Tuesday and are also searching a house and two cars, the force said. No other arrests were made.

Prime Minister Theresa May has raised the issue of terrorism with her US counterpart Donald Trump, who offered "complete support" in the investigation.

Ms May warned that the threat level will be kept at severe for the time being, meaning an attack is highly likely.
