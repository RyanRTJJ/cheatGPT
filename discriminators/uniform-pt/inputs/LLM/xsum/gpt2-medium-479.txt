"Dowry harassment may be a voluntary act on women's part when they don't mind being harassed. But if a person is arrested, the police must take action," R.P. Kala Rao, chairman of law student group A.M. Rao, urged.

Kala Rao said the case against the accused would go to the CBI.

Police arrested 26 men from Rajwar in Rajasthan after questioning them over charges of dowry harassment and sexual violence committed on the woman for three months. Kallya, of Rajwar, who is married, has been remanded in judicial custody till October.

The case against the women police officers stems from a complaint filed by a woman who said she was taken to Marathi-speaking village in Rajasthan's Bannur district when she was just 17 years old, after she filed an FIR against the accused two days after her return for some school sessions.

While the woman said she was kidnapped by the accused, who forced her to marry. Kallya and a group of friends from her village were on a school trip in Gurgaon.

Kallya allegedly married the accused when he was 14 years old, but a family court had ruled her not entitled to child support as they were widows. Her parents remarried several years ago and divorced.

The girl was in police custody till the court issued an interim order on Friday morning on the complaint, but was then released on bail.

Siddharth Deshpande, general secretary of Nizam-e-Fakt Samaj-e-Iqbal, a leading social activist organization in UP, said people should not let the arrest of dowry-harassed women as "this will continue till the end of time".

"This is a major setback for women's security. It's an issue in the West too. If such cases are made, in the West it will continue to get better. There are reports on how women like our wives are being abused in their own countries. That would have happened over in India if men couldn't get courts to order an investigation. They
