 Villa Park on Saturday (kick off 17:30 GMT).

On the other hand, Norwich, West Brom and West Ham all lost against a Liverpool side which only drew 0-0 with Spurs in the previous round. The former now find themselves in a tight battle for seventh position.

Sunderland vs Bournemouth [3.56]

It is not the kind of result to do much for the home side, but Bournemouth have also slipped back to the lower half of the table with only two points. They host Sunderland who are third from bottom and bottom with six points as well. A victory for the Dons should get the side's game back on track.

West Brom vs Arsenal [3.57]
