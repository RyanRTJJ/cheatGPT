 100 per cent effective.

The potion was created by William of Conchobham and is used in Anglo-Saxon medical texts to treat a wide range of ailments.

It contains garlic, celery seed, onion, mustard, salt and lime - all of which combine to produce a powerful all-round antibiotic.

It's believed the potion was found in a Anglo-Saxon gold casket discovered in a monastery in Germany by a metal detectorist in the 1970s.

But even more surprising was the ingredient it contained: part of the stomach or stomach lining of a cow.

Experts believe the cow's rumen plays an essential part because of its ability to produce a chemical called lactic acid. It was found to effectively block the bacterial enzyme that creates the drug.

The concoction was tested over several weeks on mice.

By two months, all of the mice showed improvement in their health conditions - with no sign of worsening.

It even worked against a specific bacterium identified as an infection causing ulcers on the inner lining of the blood vessels.

Some parts of the cow's stomach or rumen can produce substances that fight bacteria, but these are only produced in larger quantities in ruminants such as sheep.

But they can also be produced in mammals such as guinea pigs, which are used as animal models for drug companies.

Researchers will now try to apply the principle in human drug development.

It follows research which showed a similar compound found in a similar source could treat tuberculosis and hepatitis.

Dr Steven Walker, whose research led to the discovery, said: "We cannot believe our luck! This is the first time the human gut has been used as an effective natural antibiotic.

"It's amazing to think that so much has been discovered about how different mammals have evolved unique antibiotic-producing systems over thousands of years."
