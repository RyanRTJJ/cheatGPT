"All of the workers had lung problems because of the dust and chemicals and because they had to use dirty clothes," said Yoon Moo-suk, the father of a Samsung Electronics technician, who had lung cancer. "They were all very sick."

"It's very difficult to know if some of the workers may have gotten cancer," said Sung Kyu-jin, head of Samsung's safety committee in Daejeon. "But we can say we are thoroughly investigating the matter. All the workers' health is being kept in mind now."

The issue of environmental safety at Samsung's Daejeon factory comes as Samsung is embroiled in a legal scandal with one of its shareholders which accuses the conglomerate of mismanaging the Samsung Group.

The Samsung Group is South Korea's largest conglomerate, with business interests spanning a wide array of sectors. Its members include the Samsung Group, an integrated industrial company, the Samsung Trading Co and its affiliate Samsung C&T, one of South Korea's largest construction companies. Some Samsung members are also big investors in U.S.-listed Samsung Electronics, which is the world’s largest manufacturer of smartphones, and other companies.

The company has been facing serious criticism ever since it announced a $1.2 billion fine from prosecutors earlier this month for manipulating the stock of Samsung C&T to avoid a government seizure. The country's chief prosecutor said Samsung’s management used illegal strategies to gain an “undue advantage” over state owned companies in their deal to make Samsung C&T the successor in 2011.

In August, the Samsung Electronics group was fined $8.3 billion for bribing South Korean officials in the country's 2009 merger of Samsung C&T with Cheil Industries. The company was ordered to pay $1 billion and also to suspend $3.4 billion of dividends in five years.
