 been an incredible intrusion on the rights not just of minors but all individuals to privacy, the right to self-identify, the right to make their own decisions for themselves.

The proposed legislation did not get as far as that but there were a few other moves to put limits on who could have access to our personal data. There was a measure proposed to prevent organisations from sharing our personal and financial data with advertisers, which sounded like a reasonable enough approach. Yet many of these measures were defeated at the eleventh hour.

The government's proposals on the Investigatory Powers Act were another big step in the wrong direction. The new law would have given the state the power to spy on us, track our use of the internet, and gather bulk data for future analysis. The government claims that it is needed to counter serious and imminent threats from terrorists and criminals. This is not borne out by any evidence we have seen to date. Indeed, the last government, which proposed the original draft, admitted as much in the face of political opposition.

This latest initiative is not about countering genuine threats posed by serious criminals and terrorists. Instead, it is about the government using the state's increasing power to invade our privacy in order to make a political protest.

The fact that the government is going this route shows that it has totally lost sight of the needs of the ordinary person. It is the little guy that will suffer most with these new laws; the vulnerable young, those that are mentally ill, in hospitals or those that suffer a mental or physical disability that prevents them from exercising their right to privacy.

We have already seen a raft of bills introduced that restrict the rights of individuals to take part in protests and public meetings. There is also a worrying trend to force citizens to become 'citizen spies'.
