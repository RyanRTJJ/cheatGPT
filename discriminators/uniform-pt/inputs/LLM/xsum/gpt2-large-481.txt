The violence was in part a consequence of Mr Thabe'a's crackdown on dissent. He had been in power since 2003 and presided over a decade of peaceful transition from a dictatorial era. He had overseen the opening up of Libya to Western donors and the opening up of Libya to foreign financial investment.

The rebels also had reason to be angry. It was Mr Thabe'a, on his fifth election, that allowed Gaddafi's son Saif to rule with absolute confidence and make unbridled threats towards the West. For them, Mr Thabe'a's success was in large part based on the threat of intervention from the West.

He told the EU and Arab countries in June 2011: "If the West had not opened the doors of Africa to Libya, it would have died of a slow suffocation due to the absence of oxygen due to not enough food." But, he said, "for most of the African people I am a friend. I would welcome all the help from you."

At the time of his death, Mr Thabe'a was in the Middle East giving his last public speech as president. "The last thing that I hope for," he said, "is that [the United Nations] intervenes to stop the brutal and unjustified military intervention that is underway in Libya"

Libya is now in a chaotic, often violent state. Mr Thabe'a's successor, Saif al-Islam al-Senussi, a former general, appointed by Mr Thabe'a to head a transitional government, is accused of protecting Mr Gaddafi's regime. The fighting there flared up again in November 2011, after the West and its allies announced a military effort to oust the militia leader, Muammar Gaddafi, whose death was announced by the White House last April.

A new Libyan government is now trying to deal with the humanitarian crisis created by the uprising. The UN has estimated that 600,000 civilians have been forced from their homes in the last two years and some 200,000
