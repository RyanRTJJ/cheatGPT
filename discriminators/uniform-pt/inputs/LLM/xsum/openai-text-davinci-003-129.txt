rocess of creating a gaming corner and a TARDIS (from Doctor Who). The gaming corner and TARDIS are being created in the garage, which will be transformed into a game room. The game room features arcade games, racing simulators, a dartboard and a pool table. The TARDIS will be constructed from wood and fiberglass, and feature light and sound effects that will replicate the TARDIS from Doctor Who. 

The rest of the house is decorated with a Doctor Who inspired theme, using replicas from the show and items from a variety of sources. Posters and images of the Daleks, Cybermen, and the Weeping Angels adorn the walls, while action figures are displayed on shelves. Dave's collection also includes rare coins, antique gadgets and an impressive collection of comics. The centerpiece of Dave's home is the life-size, full-color Stormtrooper he commissioned. 

In addition to being dedicated to Doctor Who, Dave's home is also family-friendly, with a trophy cabinet featuring memorabilia from his children's awards and accomplishments, as well as toys, games, and books that are kid-friendly. 

Dave's semi-detached house is a tribute to Doctor Who, and a place for the whole family to enjoy. It is a treasure trove of memorabilia, filled with unique items and attractions. From the Stormtrooper to the gaming corner, Dave has created a home that celebrates a classic British TV series and allows his family to have fun.
