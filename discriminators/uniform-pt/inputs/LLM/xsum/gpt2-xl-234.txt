 position as a leading "cultural, sporting and commercial force" in north London.

Hillingdon council leader Andrew Denton, said: "It is really good news that Tottenham Hotspur is now a registered player in our area. It is a proud moment for us to welcome such a world-class football club to the borough.

"We have been working closely with Tottenham Hotspur to encourage them to make a significant investment in the local area. Now that their application has been secured, we will be working closely together to support them during their development."

In his letter to the Guardian, Elleray said: "Spurs have made this commitment to the borough and we are excited at the prospect of them joining the community and playing in our unique neighbourhood. We have also been working closely with the club to create a viable and sustainable community based development."

Elleray went on: "They will now invest up to Â£25m to develop their business in north Tottenham including two new football pitches and a new training facility. A key investment is of course the new retail and leisure area that will accompany the development to the north of the stadium.

"The club want to make the area a great place to live and work so they have set up a new business development company to manage this. We will be working closely with the club to create a compelling business plan that will support the club's long term vision and the regeneration of the area.

"Over the longer term the club needs to invest in their plans for the stadium as they intend to open a new stadium in 2016 or 2017, providing more capacity for Spurs football club. So far I have seen no evidence they intend to delay this as all their investment plans for north Tottenham were already on track.

"We already have strong contacts in the stadium development team, a team comprised of representatives from the club, local councils and development companies. We will also be working with the team in the coming months to ensure the application is as competitive as possible."
