 the Department of Electrical Engineering and Cybernetics and Professor Paul Rutter from the University of Wales Institute of Aviation Education were at the event which saw about 50 people from nine universities get together to learn about the RGC, and this week the students will be looking at the RGC's mission and why its use in Wales now merits its continued survival.


Leeds City University's Dr Simon Womble has some thoughts on why RGC's use continues to be supported in its current role as a'mainstream' aircraft type:


"Why is RGC on the books?"


Since the 1970s, there has been a consistent programme to encourage the use of aircraft on the Welsh and Republic of Ireland airways. Currently, these aircraft have been used to fill an important need: to provide the service for passengers and cargo at all times of year. They support the existing infrastructure that ensures that people do not miss flights whilst on the move.


The main reason people need an aircraft in the first place when travelling can be traced back to being transported to the airport, either from their home or other locations. There are the inevitable delays that come as a result, and there's a financial element to this. The airlines are required to fly at least a certain number of flights a day which means they can only fly during regular business hours. Therefore, these aircraft become the transport that the passengers and their families can use when they are in those locations where people usually expect to use their planes.


The RGC also assists in improving the infrastructure in towns and villages around Wales. With a number of airports in the UK, the RGC is a major facilitator of air travel between UK airports. The UK is one of the few developed countries in the world that doesn't have a domestic runway and only 3 percent of its long-haul operations are done between UK airports (in fact, fewer than 500 flights are between the UK and the rest of the world in 2004/5). This gives access to
