 out of a recording session in 2007, claiming it was "one of the lowest moments of my life". Although Brown said he could not comment on the reasons behind Reni's departure because he thought no one would believe him, he said: "Everyone in the band can attest to Reni's lacklustre nature. He's not a musician and he doesn't want to be one, so it's no big shock he's left."

Brown said he had not spoken to the frontman of the group for several months, although he had offered him regular recording sessions for new music. Now he says he has no idea where Reni is and his drummer's spot is vacant. "I wish [the other band members] all the best for the future," he said. "I don't want to be there."

Brown confirmed the tour plans would be scrapped in the absence of a replacement drummer. "We've got a lot of gigs coming up that we have no drummer for so we'll be making a call on who we bring in to round up that crew," he said. "I know we're all really disappointed, but life moves on. We'll probably end up using my drummer from my other band."

Singer and guitarist Andy Gangadeen, who is touring with the band on the tour, also announced that he believed Reni was no longer an active part of the band. "He's not playing with us â€“ we had this problem on the last tour," Gangadeen said. "We just had to get him off the road."

The guitarist said he had no idea who was to fill Reni's shoes but he felt it needed to be brought up now, because he was "looking at getting a really hot drummer in for this next tour".

Gangadeen says he has known the drummer for "10 or 12 years, I think", and describes him as a friend. "He got sacked from the band [with his] two best mates, and he didn't really have anything to do," Gangadeen said.
