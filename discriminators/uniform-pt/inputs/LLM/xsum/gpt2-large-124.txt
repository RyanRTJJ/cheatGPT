 humans, the technology will change medicine dramatically and help people fight cancer to a point where it disappears. We reported on the development a long time ago, but here's video of the first human tests.

We're going to have to see more clinical trials in human people to truly see if the technology is real. But if it proves to be useful and successful in cancer, that would totally revolutionize how doctors treat cancer patients.

Here's part of what the new technology looks like in action.

Now that you have seen how the Breathalyzer can help detect cancer risk, you'll notice an important caveat. A sample may not be accurate, and an image of you is less likely to differentiate a person that is healthy from someone that has a cancerous change in their lungs, for example. So what's a person to do? You can keep taking care of yourself by eating a healthy diet, exercising, and maintaining a calm and focused mind. Don't worry, the Breathalyzer will always be with you so you can tell if it's time to put down that unhealthy snack, or maybe to call your doctor and tell them what all of it means.
