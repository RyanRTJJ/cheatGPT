The federal government said the changes were "a necessary and proportionate response to the need for broad-based protection of all Canadians in order to continue Canada's leadership in equality for all" and noted that the move would provide "clear, objective, and easy-to-understand protections based on a person's private health information" to all Canadians over age 16.

In a statement posted on its website last month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the law is a "critical step" in fighting "harmful discrimination" against LGBTQ Canadians.

He added that his government's move to impose a nationwide ban on transgender rights and protections was based on a "well-reasoned, evidence-based" approach.

"As a society, we have the responsibility to treat all people fairly, without discrimination," Trudeau said at the time.

"As parents, we have a duty to protect all children in our society, and I recognize the difficult and painful process ahead for so many LGBTQ individuals and their loved ones."

On Tuesday, the law took effect but the ban is only a new piece in the same big picture of how LGBT Canadians live today.

For the past two decades, the Canadian government has played a key role in passing legislation that has not only made it harder for LGBTQ Canadians but also protected them against discrimination.

For decades, the Canadian government has played a key role in passing legislation that has not only made it harder for LGBTQ Canadians but also protected them against discrimination.

In 2005, the Supreme Court struck down Section 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. In 2016, the Conservative government passed Bill C-16.

Bill C-16 repealed the province of Alberta's ban on non-binary public bathroom use. The federal government said the province's measure was discriminatory given that transgender people were not a protected class under Section 12 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.

The law is a huge win for LGBTQ identity in the country. But experts say its limitations are still significant â€” particularly when it comes to protecting people from discrimination.
