 no information on preventing or treating all these infections. Instead, health professionals believe that most people develop serious types of infections.

Gow said that no vaccine or treatment is perfect but that any way we can prevent and treat them will be possible.

He said all three options are important choices for vaccine-preventable diseases.

"All medicines are safe and effective if they work with appropriate vaccine coverage", he said. "If they don't, you should not be putting your family and your own health at risk. If you vaccinate your children, you are exposing many more children."

So with that in mind, this week, the National Union of Students hosted an event to discuss the need for more science and medical research into the role of viral infections in healthcare.

"People who get infectious diseases, have HIV infection or have an unco-infectious disease, all of these can be linked to the virus," Nusantraj Singh said.

"What we need to focus on is the prevention of the greatest possible health problems within people and places of great concern for families".

The event was organised by the Foundation for Health of Canada and was brought together by the BSA Global Institute and the UN Refugee Accommodation Service.

At the event, Singh spoke about her husband, David, a lifelong cancer survivor who had cancer in 1996.

As the only surviving member of his extended family, David became convinced he could never have the chance to become a health entrepreneur.

"When your cancer comes back I'm really grateful for that, when my cancer goes, it goes into my family," said David.

"I don't want this cancer to have been the cancer that made my life better. I haven't had enough time. I needed this cancer to make me a better leader. It has gone through some tremendous pressure and I'm going to make it."

This week's events are just the beginning of a global project to eradicate the spread of viral diseases caused by viruses in people around the world.
