 anthology films of 1997 through 2001, and was a ratings hit and one of the highest-grossing domestic releases of all time.

I'm sure, by now, you've noticed that women who have died in the wake of rape are often the object of the "rage" surrounding them. This is a familiar pattern for black women in America; the media and politics constantly vilify, demonize, and demonize women.
