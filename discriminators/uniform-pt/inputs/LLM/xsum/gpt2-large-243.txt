It is estimated that UK manufacturing plants would become "self-sufficient" in the next 40 years – but the industry is now struggling with the number and scale of recalls in recent months.

Last month's recalls of 28 antibiotics from two drug manufacturing plants led to 23 deaths and prompted the UK Food Standards Agency to start a review into the safety of the drugs in the industry.

There are almost 5,000 registered firms working in the sector and more than two-thirds of the UK's exports of antimicrobials go to other countries, said Sir Andrew Dillon, UK president of the Antimicrobial Association. "We are in the middle of a crisis for public health and the business industry, which is driving the rise in antibiotic resistance."

"We are going to suffer for this because every day we run down the supply of these drugs and if we don't act now," he warned.

There had been about 100 deaths since February due to widespread resistance to the drug paracetamol, which was withdrawn from many general practice surgeries for severe pain in the aftermath of the deadly gangrene outbreak.

The latest recalls of drugs such as amikacin and amoxicillin and their derivatives, including cefuroxime and rifampicin, from UK factories were announced by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) on Wednesday.

Paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) can cause severe and permanent harm to infants, the elderly and people with kidney problems.

An analysis of the latest data by the FSA showed that in the months before the recent recalls the UK's drug-production industry had racked up some 6,000 drug related product recalls.

The agency said it had issued 3,500 safety notices for products it believes were defective or unsafe – which can lead to fines or imprisonment.

That compares with 12,500 safety notices between 2007 and 2015, the last full year of data available. By a comparison with the first two quarters of 2016, however, total drug-related product recalls since last
