), whether the measures will be included in a package of measures to deal with debt and/or debt-related problems. But one recent statement made by finance minister Yanis Varoufakis shows that a decision to reduce the austerity program could be imminent:

"The euro crisis has not reached a full tipping point. If all else fails, there will be no more debt relief. The problem here is that austerity measures of the type that Greece has just taken will have to be implemented. They have to be implemented. We need a new strategy." (Jan 26-27, 2017)

So there could be a decision soon. The question is what the decision is.

One way is to call for a third referendum, which could allow Greece's creditors to impose further measures on the country. While the creditors have said that they want to see the implementation of measures and reforms, the referendum allows people a chance to say 'no'. But this can be risky, for we might not actually hear a new campaign until 2018. Moreover, the referendum could bring the country even closer to Greece taking its own path, which the country's pro-bailout parties would never actually agree to. More likely, as Varoufakis says:

"What really happened in Greece is that the creditors' proposals for what the country should or should not do took hold on the popular level. The same is true with regards to the government's reform proposalsâ€¦I think that such a referendum process could be effective by giving the Greek people a voice and giving some chance that they are not being taken for granted. That's what's at stake here in the end." (Jan 26-27, 2017)

A second way is to refuse all further austerity measures, which is what the EU's representatives would like the government to do. Some say they will not accept any further, and the other say they can accept only a few. But the question is how to find a middle ground at which the pro-bailout camp is in agreement that they accept austerity but not all, and the anti-bailout camp accepts more, or not at all, austerity. There is room for some compromise, perhaps some amount of cuts, but in the long run we get to the point that the parties supporting the
