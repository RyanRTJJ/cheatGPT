 foreign affairs, trade and international relations – an introduction to the Cabinet that will include meetings with Cabinet ministers.

The Treasury, Northern Ireland, Foreign Office, DWP and the Ministry of Justice were among the agencies invited to apply. The Treasury may recruit an economic adviser.

The Cabinet Office was not invited – despite being one of those agencies in Whitehall that have the greatest influence on policy.

The Treasury said it was "fully committed to a Government that is based on consensus, is open and is working for the benefit of the whole country". It added it was unable to "take any part in the selection of a single candidate to undertake the job as the chief secretary to the Treasury".

A spokesperson added: "The Government needs to make these appointments based on merit rather than seniority."

A DWP spokesperson said: "The department is committed to ensuring that we provide an inclusive environment and that staff do not find themselves in a position of power but are able to do their job without fearing that they will be seen as dispensable."

He added: "We will be reviewing the position of chief secretary to government to determine whether he should be the Government's first chief secretary to the Treasury. We will not provide any further comment while that process takes place."

The same spokesperson said a Cabinet office spokesperson said the decision did not mean the current chief secretary to the Treasury, Sir Jeremy Heywood, would step down. Sir Jeremy has not been available for comment on the process.

Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: "This is nothing less than a whitewash of Whitehall's chief secretary for government, Jeremy Heywood. No senior politician has been chosen by the government to replace him. No-one."

Labour MEP LynnEngineering has taken over Heywood's post in the Commons, replacing him as a junior party whip in the House of Commons.

The Treasury website says that when Sir Jeremy was appointed permanent secretary of the Treasury – Whitehall's main department – in January 2000, it said he was "responsible for creating a modern and flexible department ready for the challenges of 21st Century Britain and the rest of the world".
