 that boys at the home abused him, some sexually and some violently.

It happened in the 1960s at St Francis Boys Home, in Shefford, near Bedford, and in the 1970s at the school in north London where he found work. The Metropolitan Police is trying to trace several other potential victims.

One victim was 12 years old in the 1980s at a boy’s home in Surrey. Detectives believe he was sexually assaulted “on at least 2 occasions”. Another man, who was abused in the 1980s in another school and who is now in his 30s, said he was assaulted “on at least six occasions”, the Press Association said.

The alleged abuse came to light when his mother, who has now died, found some of his records on the internet and contacted the police. The Met said in a statement: “We are committed to taking any allegations of abuse seriously, and will treat them with the utmost sensitivity.”

Police are aware that abuse may have taken place. One school that was aware of the abuse said it had been reported to the police and the Home Office, the Home Secretary’s office, the Department for Education and other agencies, which may have led to some survivors being protected.

“It was a matter of time before someone got some of the documentation they needed on the internet,” a former resident told Reuters. “It was terrible that we were abused.”

Police believe that the abuse was carried out by the same man. It took place in various countries and most of the abuse happened while the victims were in school age. At least one of the incidents took place at boarding school, which the Met has been unable to trace.

At least three of the alleged abusers have been dead for some time and the Met is also investigating if they were responsible.
