C becomes the cornerstone of Welsh culture.

"The Channel 4 licence for S4C is due to expire in 2014. As the Welsh Government has already indicated that S4C will continue to have a central role in Welsh culture, there would need to be a review of its future after that."

The report also said that:

its budget could be increased to ensure the channel remains "a place of Welsh cultural expression and pride";

it should not have a "deteriorated image", and it should remain "on the high street";

there should be more "local programming";

there should be a "strong focus on programmes of interest locally";

it should be supported by the Welsh Government and the UK Government;

new "media technologies" should be included in the next licence bid and the broadcasting industry should be "open" to the channel's ideas.

Report: S4C should be long-term commitment

A report called S4C - Our Future by the Culture, Welsh Language and Communications Committee says, in the "short-term":

S4C should be "secure" as an "affordable" channel for all Wales and its "culture must be protected".

It should produce content and programmes "that reflect the history, diversity and rich heritage of Wales and the communities that help make it great".

The channel's "role" should be to "enrich learning in Wales" and "promote the language, culture and heritage of our own communities" and it should be "easy to find".

It should develop links with the public sector and "deliver relevant services and public value".

It should use "innovative technologies" to provide "a quality service that is both accessible and attractive to an audience that is increasing in number".

And in the "medium term" it should "continue to develop" all of these things.

The report also said that a "review of S4C's long-term future is warranted".

It should "ensure that S4C has a secure future" and that there should be a review "every five years".
