 has been turned inward, as she has spent six days a week in her Brighton constituency campaigning for Remain. Now, with three days gone since the vote, that Brexit is in a state of semi-coma. But she still refuses to say what she wants to do.

Some of the confusion is strategic. Much of the commentary on Britain's European crisis is based on the view that Ms. May is a Brexiteer. Because of that, they argue, she has an incentive to deliver something close to what the Leave campaign (and Donald Trump) wants. (One of the most prominent Brexit economists, for example, predicts that leaving will have no impact on real GDP over the medium term—which would be positive news for anyone who fears it might cause stagnation.) The most likely thing, however, is that Ms. May is actually hoping to keep her promise to deliver Brexit, only in a form that allows Theresa May and her Cabinet to claim that their vision has won out.

But whatever her intentions, Ms. May's strategy would amount to a stunning act of economic vandalism in the run-up to Christmas. How? As even her allies admit, Brexit means the loss of the EU's priceless single market. It's impossible to be in business and not depend on Europe, or to be a consumer and not buy from other EU member states.

It's hard to overestimate the value of the European single market now. Its impact on UK life has been almost immediate. The country's biggest retailers are now panicking that there is nowhere they can obtain the clothes, electronics, furniture and other merchandise that have become as British as apple pie. Companies say that the average price of a new car has almost doubled in the past year, thanks to tariffs imposed by the EU. That's because EU-made cars (and components) are taxed less by UK governments than those made in nations outside Europe. And, more seriously for the economy, the cost Britain will have to pay to settle its debt has risen by almost 20 billion pounds—$24 billion—since last year, and the government has cut spending yet further.

None of that is trivial. Indeed, it is potentially catastrophic, because the impact of those costs is being exacerbated by the rise in the value of sterling.
