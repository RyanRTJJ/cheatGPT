 condemned rebels — the first such incidents on Saudi soil since last spring.

Both sides are still reeling from an anti-government uprising which left hundreds dead and many more injured. And their conflicts were not without their own tolls.

The United States — on top of regular drone strikes in Syria — has carried out around 80 aerial attacks on the rebel groups, killing and wounding civilians, including civilians from the Al-Shaab and affiliated rebel groups, according to Human Rights Watch.

At least 22 people have been killed in the war since March 2011, when the uprising broke out in response to a Saudi-led blockade of Syria and Iran, which the United States accused of turning the country into a haven for Hezbollah, Iraq's Shiite militia. Hezbollah denies participating in the uprising, which targeted its government headquarters in Beirut along with civilians in dozens of cities.

In mid-May, Syrian state television announced that at least 12 people had been killed "by strikes by Syrian army helicopters during regime violations of the country's territorial integrity, air spaces and airspace" as well as by ground attacks by "non-Syrian army troops," including rebel forces backed by the Russians.

Syria now borders several key Saudi, Israeli, Jordan and UAE-allied countries, including a coalition of pro-regime militiamen in Lebanon, and is regularly targeted by Western military aircraft.

In 2014, a coalition of 12 countries, including the United States including its largest military base in the Middle East, carried out its first air strikes against Syrian troops in a mission aimed at stopping them from attempting to take over Damascus, with US intelligence officials citing evidence to show the strike was conducted in response to the civil war.

The US also carried out an air strike in Syria in February 2015, a week after another Syrian rebel stronghold of Rastan was also captured by the rebels in their final battle of the uprising. The operation ended in less than two months' time when the Syrian aircraft were shot down off the coast of Deir
