 creator John Davies getting as far as the Isle of Axholme in Lincolnshire and visiting the home of Action Man's main character, Pete Hammond, in Sutton, near Rochdale.

A second 'official' model was launched on Friday at the Manchester Museum and the third model and the first in miniature form will be released on 13 June, the anniversary of the release of the first toy that came in a box.

The company says that it is aiming to bring two miniature figures every year, one which will be the main character from the main character's first adventures to those in 2018, like the original Action Man was launched with in 1966.

The models are based on some of the best-known figures from the original Action Man series, the first of which was released in 1966, when the new doll model was launched.

Davies tells Newsbeat he's going to give the doll a proper going over - and it's going to be based on a version of Action Man which was being sold to children in 1966.

A year later the first two models of the main character were launched - although the first ones were just based on him.

"It's going to be the most authentic recreation I can make."

"I'm going to give Action Man a full body overhaul, and it's going to be based on the Action Man which we were selling to children in 1966."

He told Newsbeat that he hasn't decided how much to spend on the project.

"It's costing so much and time to make them - just to get one off the mould is Â£3,000.

"What it costs is more than the first one."

You can't go wrong with this Action Men doll...

But he adds that he won't make any more and that this is the last.

He says he has wanted to do this for many years and he wants his grandchildren to experience making Action Man themselves.

"I can't see myself doing any more," he says.

"It's time for this to be gone now.

"It's all been a privilege
