 will start a pilot study to offer online courses from its four-year and 12-year campuses, starting with English and linguistics and eventually going on to history, philosophy and economics.

UT System Chief Information Officer Greg Cappelli says online learning has already proven that "education and information is possible when you break down barriers." The UT System says the pilot online program will begin with teaching English and linguistics next spring and will eventually be extended to fields such as history, economics and ethics and all humanities except psychology. It will not offer a pre-requisite course of any kind.

The UT System says it will make the pilot online learning courses available to all students at its four-year system campuses using a new "learning management system," which integrates course materials, student information and faculty assessments into the online campus environment. However, the system will only offer the pilot online degree programs to students who have an associate's degree or higher from an accredited institution. Other requirements include a high school degree that is recognized by the Texas Educational Standards Committee and a bachelor's degree in a relevant field. UT Austin undergraduate students will be able to enroll in the language program as part of the existing UT College-Bound Courses program. The new program is expected to begin in spring 2019 and last two semesters.

The move represents one of the university's largest investment to date into online learning and is in line with UT's broader strategic plan for the university as it builds on its position as the nation's largest public research university.

"Online learning is a very exciting idea of the future, but how it can be most effective depends on how we design it," Cappelli said.

It's unclear if the coursework for the pilot online degree programs will be paid for by the state of Texas or by the state university, or maybe a combination of both.

Cappelli said the online learning pilot program will be an online system that can be adapted to other university campuses in the university system.

"The UT System is committed to this, we
