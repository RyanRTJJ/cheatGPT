 the three veto-power positions reserved for permanent members. The UK even negotiated a new trade deal on a much higher level than the deal negotiated with America. Now that deal has fallen through, making a two-year delay inevitable. And the UK still doesn’t know what will replace it. The only certainty is that it won’t be what Britain had planned: a much closer relationship with the US.

So what does all this mean? Many will assume that Britain will simply walk away from the EU – as some did when Theresa May became Prime Minister in July, despite what appeared to be an overwhelming mandate for remaining in Europe. A smaller and weaker Europe? Surely not, the Prime Minister argues. No, we need more integration – more trade, more cooperation, more cooperation with other parts of the EU to reduce migration and more cooperation with our continental neighbours.

But that’s not what European leaders will say. Instead, they will suggest leaving the EU altogether, which is what some economists suggest might happen, too. They’ll say that Brexit can be managed – but not indefinitely, nor with Britain in control.

That would be easy to say today. The Brexit bill is running behind schedule, with the European Commission’s legal service calculating it could take until the end of 2019 to get to grips with Britain’s Brexit bill. At the end of 2018, more than £300m was outstanding. And there are still outstanding demands for billions of euros of UK pension money from the exchequer and interest on that money; demands made by the Government in the past for the remaining 27 states in the EU to recognise the UK as a sovereign country; demands made of Britain by some states in the EU over rights – and now, demands that Britain actually negotiate how those rights and freedom of movement, access to education and healthcare will work from outside the EU.
