ying up land to keep it in your hands and then later letting it increase in value - see here for a detailed explanation) is also profitable, as are other land plays, such as the increasing trend of "retail parks." Indeed, we might have a similar situation to that of the U.K.: land could be bought up around supermarkets and shopping malls and then sold off again at a higher price (or rents increased across the board on the remaining land). I'd certainly be curious to see what it looked like.

Finally, I wonder whether any of this could cause "speculative oversupply" (which I discussed here). That is, would developers have to "buy back" land in their portfolio just to remain profitable? In a sense this would lead to a zero-sum game: if there were a rush of buying-back decisions, then the same number of new developments would be built, but at a lower price per square foot. Hence the "spikey" effect.

"In order to sustain this new economic model, developers need to find new revenue streams, says Mr. Choudhuri. They could, for example, raise property taxes on new developments by 15%. Developers will only build for cash, to build and sell. “The only thing the government must do is allow prices to come down,” he says.

This is what happens when you start to look beyond the macro picture, and consider a different set of questions. Even if land prices do fall substantially, it won't happen overnight - you need to allow for some slippage, and you're likely to witness a boom/bust cycle as a result.

Since I've been working on research showing that "land value" is not a good predictor of where the next wave of development will occur, and the only reason we have an idea which (semi-)major cities will get the bulk of the extra urban space is due to a lack of competition on prices between them, I was asked if this could be taken advantage of by a savvy firm.

The answer is: yes, it can be - but only if there are willing buyers in the form of a strong private-sector investment market. To be
