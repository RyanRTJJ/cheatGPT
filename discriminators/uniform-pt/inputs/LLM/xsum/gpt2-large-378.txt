 even after a short-term use of the drug, a charity report says.

Many people who suffer from these problems don't want to admit they have a problem or are too afraid, the charity suggests.

The report, Treatment of Coughs and Fomites in the Elderly is aimed at changing these attitudes about long-term use of the drug.

'People think we're all getting older,' said Helen Purnell, consultant pharmacist and member of the Royal College of Paediatrics.

The charity said the drug was very well designed and well documented and not harmful when given in the right circumstances.

'There are a lot of people who claim they suffer from a chronic condition when in fact we see cases, for example, where someone has no complaints and no problems when they take this medication,' said Ms Purnell.

She said the drug is much better now than it was 30 years ago as a result of modern testing.

Dr David Choudhury, head of health promotion and services at NHS England, said: 'The evidence is very clear that short-term use of the drug is safe and well tolerated. The current recommendation is that we have nothing to do with it and to put our money where our mouths are and advise patients to use generic medicines.'

Mums and dads said they were still 'horrified' when they first smoked the chemical back in the late 1950s.

But the NHS advice changed in the past decade to encourage doctors to stop recommending it to children and 'not to panic'. It said children should be given it only in exceptional circumstances, such as when they are suffering from a serious and life-threatening disorder or when pain can be controlled by other measures, such as corticosteroid injections.

The drug was first tested in the 1950s and developed in England in 1967 by a group of scientists with a doctorate in chemistry at King's College London.

It has been licensed in the U.S., France, Canada and the Netherlands as an anti-inflammatory drug with similar properties to the cough medicines aspirin and ibuprofen.
