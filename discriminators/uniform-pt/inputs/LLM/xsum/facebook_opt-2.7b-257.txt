rated in the USA, Europe and Israel.

The American Jewish Committee said it had received a large number of calls from Jewish organisations around the country.

One told the organisation it had a family member that it was concerned about.

A series of swastikas had been found in Pittsburgh, Wisconsin and Alabama, it said.

The AIPAC report of Monday found that the wave included more than 400 incidents.

'Great threat'

A further 22 incidents of vandalism and graffiti had been reported worldwide, it said.

American Jewish Committee officials said they did not think the attacks rose to the levels of violence that had occurred in Europe or Israel.

But they did warn of a great threat for American Jewry and warned against taking any chances.

"They think about their families here when they come home and think about if we're going to be safe," Yaffa Berger, the organisation's regional head of US public affairs, told CBS.

"We don't have to take these steps, but we want to remind them that we have this security around us and this is real."

"Every time another Jewish family or young couple in America comes under attack, people on the street have that real sense of concern."

A spokesman for Jewish leaders in Britain said: "I think they know they're not immune."

Carnage in Poland and Slovakia

In Poland, hundreds have been beaten up in Jewish streets or attacked and chased in Jewish neighbourhoods. In one incident, a Jewish cemetery was set ablaze.

In Slovakia, a new Orthodox Jewish cemetery was attacked.

A Jewish group in Russia reported an increase in harassment. And in Kiev, four graves had been desecrated overnight, the news agency Interfax reported.

The attacks have prompted officials to send troops to Jewish communities, including a Jewish Defence League unit.

Jews make up between four and five per cent of the US population. There are about 100,000 Jewish people living in the UK, according to the British Jewish community.

More than 30 cases have been reported
