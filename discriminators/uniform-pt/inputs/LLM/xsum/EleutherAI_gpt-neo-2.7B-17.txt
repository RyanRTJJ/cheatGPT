 right to know" about money in their own pockets, and that the government's "silence" on the question was "unacceptably self-serving".

At the Conservative conference, former chancellor Norman Lamont backed the call for full disclosure from ministers. However, he said there was "an acceptable degree of compromise". This could still lead to some tax avoidance. The Lib Dems said they did not agree with all of the measures – for instance the fact that it would be very difficult to make a "clean' disclosure – but said the government was seeking "an unvarnished answer which has the integrity and clarity that taxpayers want".

It is unclear whether the government shares those concerns. The Lib Dems and the Green party welcomed the government's agreement to publish "select tax details of taxpayers holding financial investments in a range of public and private bodies" – though they suggested it had not been made clear who would be held accountable. The Conservatives have pledged to publish their tax returns from 2013 to 2014; Labour is already doing so, as part of its commitment to the government's proposals. But the Treasury has warned that disclosing tax details would "compromise" attempts to build a long-term public interest in taxation.

The government's response to mounting pressure from campaigners illustrates that the coalition's first real test as government is likely to come soon. There is a danger that the Conservatives in government will find it more difficult to make their manifesto promises and hold their coalition partners to their fairytale promises. In the short term, that is unlikely to have an impact as the coalition enters the next phase of the election campaign. However, we can expect to see more and more of the government's new promises coming under fire from political rivals and the media.
