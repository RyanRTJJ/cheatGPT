Samsung initially announced that its devices' batteries would only be replaced and not repaired. But Apple on Friday filed its complaint with South Korea's Fair Trade Commission, prompting Samsung to reverse course.

A Samsung representative said the issue involved a battery chemistry issue and only affected certain phones. He declined further comment to a reporter.

The South Korean company is the world's top maker of smartphones and memory chips, though its sales are slowing. Samsung has repeatedly been sued by Apple over its iPhones and iPads, and Samsung is also fighting a patent case against Apple in the U.S. and multiple other cases in several countries.

The two sides are due to begin talks on a resolution of the patent dispute on Oct. 11.

The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, 12-cv-00228, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). (Reporting by Tzu-Ching Lee, Josephine Mason and Josephine Mason; Editing by Andrea Ricci)
