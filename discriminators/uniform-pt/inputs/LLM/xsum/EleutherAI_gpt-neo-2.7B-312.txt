 health services of the EU.

What’s the evidence: The European Union (EU) gave Britain funding worth £39.4bn between 2004 and 2014. Under the EU’s Horizon 2020 spending programme, spending has been increasing at 4.3% per year to £39.57bn. The figure represents money to spend on research, teaching and health across the EU’s 28 member states, not just in Britain.

But as well as agreeing to this £39.4bn in funding, the UK could have been allowed to continue its contribution even after leaving the EU. This was only partly possible because of the EU’s rules on spending: it must be approved by the member states before the funds are passed on to their member states unless they agreed a similar amount to be spent on medical research.

That is unless the UK voted to leave the EU. The only way to ensure this UK contribution would have continued, even after a Brexit vote, is for the UK to stay in the EU.

The EU says the UK would not have a say on the amount it contributed and that the decision would have been made by 28 member states rather than Brussels.

But there is another way to look at this: if the UK could have agreed to continue investing in medical research and innovation in the EU as a single market and customs union member state after a Brexit vote, instead of leaving the EU, then the UK government should do that instead of leaving the EU.

What you need to understand is that this £39.4bn is not the EU’s tax on the UK. It is more like a tax we pay for using it. It’s still worth billions because the UK still contributes so much money, which is why the UK is still part of the EU.

We wouldn’t get our money back without having to pay it back.

But our contribution to the EU is less than it’s worth so this money is effectively being stolen from us by Brussels. That has long-term financial consequences for any country that has contributed to the EU (like the UK), as well as leaving those countries with a diminished ability to contribute to other policies, such as security, defence, and EU
