 world's minimum safe child mortality rate and the number could grow if access to medical care remains poor.

The government and the World Health Organisation are working to make this a reality.

The health minister, Prof. David Mabuza, launched a campaign to cut the number still-births – an estimated 30,000 each year – and child deaths from malaria and other diseases.

"It's a step change in the country on account of having more data on which these improvements can be based on and so we actually have the information to say which diseases are more prevalent and can be effectively addressed in order to bring about better improvements," he told the BBC's The Mid-day Report.

He was in neighbouring Zimbabwe to mark the first successful attempt to vaccinate more than 90,000 children against polio against that disease.

In South Africa, the government is committed to getting the child mortality rate to 50 by 2015 from an all-time high of 120.50 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2010.

"If we are to get to that target, it means that we have to make sure that children don't die at any stage of their life, even in infancy, including pre-natal," said Mr Mabuza.

"And we have to try and minimise as far as possible the death risk that they face through preventable causes, even if it means taking a life at a very young age to get to the safe level of 50 per 1,000."

But some experts are warning that South Africa's record progress could also be jeopardised by a return to the high levels of inequality that led to a spate of political violence in post-apartheid South Africa in the 1990s. The rich-poor gap is widening sharply again and is affecting children, according to a World Bank review of child deaths.

"Our social progress has made inequality worse," said Professor Ntsala Keisana, who heads the health unit at the Johannesburg Poverty Action Group, a network of over a dozen non-governmental organisations dealing with poverty and inequality.

"The reason South Africa has the second highest rate of child deaths is that children in poor households are more vulnerable to illnesses.

"And if you have
