Serbia's players celebrated, and Wales's did too but it was not enough to turn the tide and the home fans booed the players off the pitch.

Wales did find time to show some sympathy for the Republic with their supporters chanting "Ireland's our bro".

Wales were undeterred and hit back six minutes later through Gareth Bale, who ran through from full-back and slipped the ball to his more central partner Scott Williams.

The Welsh also had the advantage of possession for long periods during the first half, but Serbia's keeper, Vladan Milosavljevic, had to be at his best to
