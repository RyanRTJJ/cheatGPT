 it described as "an unprecedented move".

The £900m proposal – a 50% increase on the current £170m budget – comes a day after the Welsh government gave the green light to land use plans.

The government has committed to building a 40-metre "railway of the future" for the west of Wales between Cardiff and Anglesey by 2020 and connecting to the North Sea rail network via Pembrokeshire, Gwynedd and Pembrokeshire.

The railway is to incorporate new passenger and freight services, as well as commuter and intercity traffic.

Other plans include a new east coast line from Swansea Bay to Swansea Bay, the West of Wales HS2 train link, and an extension of the airport north of Cardiff, as part of the government's vision for the coast.

The railway would link up with the £1.6bn HS2 rail link and the Swansea-Cardiff HS2 corridor, which will link London with the South East and the rest of the UK via the West Midlands.

The Welsh prime minister, Carwyn Jones, said it was a "great day for Wales" when the proposals from Historic Wales for a new railway came up for approval. "This is a huge opportunity for the country," he said. "It allows us to make a strong stand against the UK Government's plans for the English Midlands."

The first phase of the rail infrastructure was outlined in the 2016 Welsh government white paper, released when Carwyn Jones was minister for culture, tourism and the arts and was ahead of the plans now being considered by Historic Wales, and will have the capacity to carry 70,000 passengers per annum.

The plan would include a new major south coast line to Swansea Bay that may include new passenger services, as well as intercity services into London via Pembrokeshire, Gwynedd and Pembrokeshire.

Ministers hope that the £900m package of railway infrastructure may create additional jobs as well as creating business opportunities, making the plans one of the "best and best deals" for the UK's £20bn infrastructure programme.
