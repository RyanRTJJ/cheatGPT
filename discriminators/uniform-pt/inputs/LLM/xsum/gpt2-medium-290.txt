 that they had acted in defence of the public interest and for human rights. Although Dart was an associate of the Chechen-language magazine Inspire, he is not believed to have been involved in organising the killings.

Crown prosecutor Jonathan Gaven said that "in a country and a place where the rights of individuals are increasingly being forgotten, here we see an increase in the criminalisation of what has traditionally been viewed as an isolated incident".

According to a report by the human rights organisation Reprieve, in 2014 there were 18,200 cases of persecution against Muslim men by their families or friends. As an increasing number of Muslim families are breaking down the glass walls separating them from the mainstream of British society, it is increasingly hard for those left alone to continue living in a society with no real sense of their own rights. In addition, the threat of terrorist plots, combined with increased surveillance by far-right groups, makes family life increasingly fraught.

Iman Sharmila, a research assistant at the Reprieve office, said: "In a world increasingly afraid to recognise these things going on, with no one listening or speaking out, perhaps it is all the more vital for the government and other institutions to take action. The police need to take more action to protect members of the public from threats such as these."

Gaven said that after a trial the three men had been sent via the Community Standards Unit to a women's prison and given a range of restrictions to abide by.

"The sentence has taken the prison administration by surprise," she said. "It's been a long time since we have received such an important sentence for what the trio did and to be able to move forward together." She was not aware of any judicial review.

It remains unclear whether they will be able to be released. Gaven added that they will probably have to register as a sex offender, rather than simply being granted leave to appeal
