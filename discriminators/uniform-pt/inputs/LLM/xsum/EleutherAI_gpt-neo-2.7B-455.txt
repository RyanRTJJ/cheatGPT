 two options raising the council tax would bring in £6.8m, but only £3.6m if you include other possible savings that haven’t been outlined. The third option is the same budget the council will have in 2020 as it has in 2019 for 2019/2020 so we shall see what happens in the next year or two…

The budget options are to:

Create an additional revenue stream by cutting services that don’t bring in an extra £1.5m (possible cost to services is a £800m figure put forward by the ‘independent budget experts’ (the people who made the initial draft) and the mayor of Walsall).

Keep the rate paid to the Council Tax (as it is now) (costing £23.5m a year to Wally)

Raising council tax

Raising council tax would create one extra £1.8m to meet the budget in 2019/2020 but a further £4m in 2020/2021 so the total extra money in 2020/2021 would be £7.6m. In 2019, however, raising the council tax only costs £1.7m which could be achieved by cutting a number of services. If, for example, a full list of services proposed in the document can be confirmed in April, this would result in a reduction/elimination of services worth £3.3m next year. The options are:

Reduction in Council Tax on properties in an Area (a district not chosen has to be able to pay and the reduced amount is added to the bill)

Removal of services – no one is suggesting that any of the ‘in-service’ items should be reduced but Walsall residents and Council do not have to see all services reduced; only services to a point of redundancy.

Walsall residents would be given a veto on the reduction of services to reduce cost (the council could accept all reduced services but residents would be able to veto any service reduction if they so wished)

Walsall residents would be given a say on which council services should be axed

No ‘waste’ cut (services to be cut must be able
