ommended the government to set up an online registration and annual review system. She also recommended that the government provide additional funding to support the welfare and educational needs of those who are home-educated.

The report also pointed out that the issues faced by home-educated children are intricate and interconnected to the wider population of families experiencing poverty, housing difficulties and mental health concerns. In addition to increased funding, the report called for legislation that would ensure that councils and health professionals provide comprehensive advice and support to all home-educating families. This includes qualified teachers and other professional support staff. It should further ensure that home-educated children have access to appropriate group activities, clubs, and education and training facilities.

In order to ensure that those children and young people who require special attention and support get it, the report argued for a mandatory annual review for all home-educating families. The review should include data provided by the parent/carer, a baseline assessment to note any medical needs and additional support needs, and a review of learner progress and educational activities. The report further suggested that local authorities should publish a statement of intent that sets out their commitment to supporting effective home-education. 

The report concluded with a call to action to the government to help better meet the needs of home-educated families with relatively simple and cost-effective changes. It emphasised the importance of providing additional resources and support to home-educators, to ensure that those children at greater risk of poverty and mental ill health have access to the resources and support that they need.
