Ginny Geller made 62 runs in his debut for the club but ended the day with three more.

That's up slightly from his previous total of 79 for Arsenal after starting the day 4-0-0.

Geller was replaced on the night by Sam Allen and it seemed to go to his will.

But it wasn't quite his last play on the pitch.

Pep Guardiola didn't have a point, with the Spaniard playing on out against the Royals before a superb move out of the game.

Geller found a way before going from just under 24 until half-time.

He then scored his side's first goal of the season.

For the Tigers, it was another disappointing performance.

The first half failed.

Then just half an hour later he had three more runs and was called for a second.

For the second it was the opposite way.

With three minutes left in play, Geller missed a superb shot that went wide.

So it would seem to have gone to him.

Geller went into the half with his full fitness and was substituted by Gareth McAuley, but he was replaced by Ciaran Clark.

Then he scored just when he'd really needed to.

Ciaran Clark went out on his own, only for his teammate Daniel Albertsons to slip off the pitch.

It was Ciaran Clark who went after a late goal.

But, from there, it was about as much fun as you could get.

With the first goal of the half, the two goals from Geller's last two goals on the pitch came down to two.

The third goal went to Craig Dawson and a fine cross from the home side was another on the counter.

But after that, both goals came down to the hosts.

You could see the intensity in the mood when the first goal came.

You could see the desire in those last six minutes.

There was a good effort from Reid from the right to cross the line.

It was Reid's goal to end the innings.
