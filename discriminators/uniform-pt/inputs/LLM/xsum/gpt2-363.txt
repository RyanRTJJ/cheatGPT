Why this makes the UK so much more expensive than our rest of the world

Given how poorly our data are going, it's hard to overstate the UK's new reputation at home as a global superpower. Even though many other countries have much greater trade deficits with the US than the UK, the UK remains the world's second-lowest-end economy after China.

The U.S. has made improvements in economic development at a faster pace than most other economically developed countries. When you factor in that China is just as good a supplier of goods and services as you are in the U.S., the country will continue to be a major and important part of a global economy that has an increasing population (and as far as the US goes it's now almost certainly the second largest country).

At home our growth is slow, but the United States is already very competitive from a financial perspective. It's a strong leader in the world of trade, but also has a thriving and important base of international investment to promote trade. A third country known as the United States has the fastest growth overall, albeit not as fast as the UK.

And then there are those nations that have a less expensive (but competitive) trade regime than the rest of the world, such as Canada. Both the European Economic Area (EEA) and its sister countries (Ireland, Luxembourg, Sweden, Norway etc) are very competitive. While both EU and U.S. firms use the EEA market in a way that is similar to the U.S., these are mainly from countries who are not willing to take more (or less) risks (as they say in the U.S) with their businesses; that means that the U.S. gets much more than Canadian firms do (though those firms also get a lower return from the EEA market.)

It's not just about trade, however. It goes beyond that. It is about
