 interior ministry has released pictures of people hiding in basements as the insurgents entered the capital.

Bakhtawar Khaili, Zabul’s top female police official, told the BBC that the Taliban were attacking various parts of the city throughout the morning to advance beyond the city walls. “The Taliban are trying to seize police buildings all over the city, and are close to the government building and the prison in the outskirts,” she said.

Nabilla Durrani, the deputy speaker of Afghanistan’s parliament, told the BBC at the parliament building that “as soon as we heard the firing from other parts of Zabul province, we went to parliament to get into position.”

The Taliban have taken control of the southern city of Helmand, another key position in the country where large tracts of the country’s opium and heroin are produced. The news comes after the government said foreign troops would be withdrawn from Afghan cities, except those in heavily-fortified areas.

The foreign troops’ withdrawal, agreed under a landmark security deal with the insurgents, could bring a swift end to 14 years of war in the impoverished country.

“The city of Lashkar Gah is under our control today,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban. The insurgents had captured Lashkar Gah on Wednesday from the Afghan army, he said.

US President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan followed a series of military and civilian casualties there, which he blames on US allies, specifically the Afghan government and the NATO alliance.

The Taliban’s rapid expansion comes as US officials in Kabul say Taliban leaders had gathered in Pakistan the night before to reach an agreement with US officials.

The two sides are due to continue negotiating the terms of an agreement that would see thousands of US and NATO troops leave Afghanistan as part of a deal announced in February by President Trump.

The Taliban did not comment on the reports of a Taliban meeting in the capital of Pakistan. However, the Taliban have made repeated calls in recent months for a meeting at the peace camp in Doha,
