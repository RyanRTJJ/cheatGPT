 believed to be an Arctic ringed seal, removed to Norway to protect the rare species. Its conservation status - if the animal is confirmed as a ringed seal - has been classified "critically endangered" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is an island-breeding species found in the Arctic region. A petition led by the Angling Trust has been lodged with the Duchy of Cornwall. Ringed seals are already protected from hunting with no permit required to kill this kind of species under the EU Habitats Directive.



The charity says there have been repeated reports of a seal having been killed on the island by a lobster fisherman. Fishermen say the seal "came right" for cod and ling in their creels. They suspect it may be "one of" the Arctic ringed seals on Seal island, an area of mud and rubble that supports a small colony. Another ringed seal is also thought to be on another Hebridean islet, Flotta. But conservationists say that has not been confirmed.



The animal has not always been present: one of the first people-recorded seeing the seal was a Mr Alexander Macdonald in 1829 in a letter to his wife in London. He mentioned he caught and ate the seal's blubber on an island south of Gairsa, in the Western Isles. The Angling Trust's petition, to support the campaign to save ringed seals says: "This animal has been sighted there for some 40 years or more. For many years it lived on the north coast of the island with up to 150 seals being seen in the one area, including the mother and her pups.



"It then suddenly disappeared in the mid-2000s with no explanation. Reports from the area soon confirmed that seal numbers had been reduced to less than half of the former population."

Mr Robert Gittany is a fisherman who uses Gairsa for his lobster pots and has become familiar with the seal. He said: "I know this seal has been there for a long time. It's in the winter that they're usually seen there so if the animals are coming down from the north,
