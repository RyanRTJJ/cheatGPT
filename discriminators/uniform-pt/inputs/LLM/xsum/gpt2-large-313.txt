 a consistent season ahead and Russell was terrific today," added manager Vern Cotter.

"He looked absolutely unstoppable. He made good decisions at all times and I think he's been the most comfortable player we've had at fly-half this season."

After being named in the squad on his return to the club following a successful spell in New Zealand in 2011-12, Russell became a regular in the Lions side in the second half of the 2015-16 season before his injury kept him out of action until the Lions' tour to Australia in December 2016.

Russell had a fine haul of 22 points against Racing when he was sidelined. He will start against Bath on Saturday.

Glasgow boss Gregor Townsend was pleased with his players' performance on Friday with his side picking up just their third victory of the season after losing their opening two matches.

"We made them work hard in the first half, they did well in the second half, we didn't put the ball in the back of the posts again, we didn't let them come back on," said Townsend.

"They've been a credit to Edinburgh, they were relentless on both sides of the ball, they had the presence of mind, they didn't get caught up in a game. They had enough presence and awareness to not just finish it off."

Glasgow's next encounter with Racing is scheduled for Saturday evening at Pittodrie.
