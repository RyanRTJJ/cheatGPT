 said. "It's like a Snapchat filter," Baozi said.

The social media giant does not disclose any personal data about its users. But its privacy policy, which it is obliged to maintain "no matter how it is used," outlines how it protects user data.

Facebook says the service makes users' Facebook identities "highly visible" and that it monitors the data they supply to other companies and uses it to provide tailored ads. "We also may use your Facebook ID, photos and posts to send you advertising that is relevant to your interests and the ads you see," it writes. It says it also uses "personally identifiable information" to provide and "improve" their services.

Facebook's service "is currently only for users who have chosen to opt into these services, which are aimed at users of our mobile applications, based on your interests," the company wrote Thursday. "We are currently testing a new feature that may bring the functionality to all users."

One of the company's first "secret messages" was a Facebook photo posted by a person "watching the live feed" who appeared to be in a Facebook contest. A few days later, a man, who at the time the photo went on his MySpace profile, posted to Facebook an image with the text: "You win! Your username is XXXXXX," a reference to Facebook's rival to YouTube, Giphy.

A person named Peter B. told Reuters that he saw a Facebook "secret message" post from 2009 and "thought they were real." His account was deleted, but he returned two days later. But only then did he learn which of five friends he had been using "secretly" to message one another "over and over again."

Baozi said it would become illegal in 2018 for him to give out confidential data to someone without permission, and that he would try to put pressure on Facebook with a private legal action to protect himself.
