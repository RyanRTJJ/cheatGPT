 Criminal Law Revision Commission will "take a close look to ensure we have full sexual history information for every sexual assault".

He added: "We should not condone the sexual promiscuity of women as it could be a potential cause. We do not understand why the law treats men and women differently."

Mr Cuthbertson said one way of bringing promiscuity into rape trials is to include a complainant's sexual past.

He wrote: "Should this (include) information be available? If available, what is the best way to put this in? Should a past history of promiscuity be something that should be part of the evidence? In summary, is sexual history information that should be put into evidence by prosecutors?

"It could come as rather a shock to many as to how many men and women have slept around."

Mr Cuthbertson said women who have slept around are still "the norm" but there are cases where a man could be seen as a potential serial rapist because of his previous sex life.

Mr Cuthbertson submitted an expert report to the Commission saying if a person was a sexual predator there would be "no way of knowing" and said it would be up to the police to investigate.
