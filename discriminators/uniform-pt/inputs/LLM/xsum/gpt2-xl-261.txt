 year, leaving its quarterly results at risk of being skewed.

Toshiba shares fell 1.5 percent in Tokyo trading despite Toshiba agreeing its financial performance could be impacted by the restructuring.

The U.S. firm filed losses of 2 billion yen in the January to March period. Its net profit for the year so far was 1.2 trillion yen, or $16.2 billion.

Yoshinori Terada, CEO of Toshiba, said in an interview published on Wednesday that the planned restructuring will not affect core business. "We will continue to provide strong innovation and leadership in our existing products as well as new products as needed," he said. Japan's second-biggest company, Toshiba is a key supplier to Sony, Sharp, Sony Corp and Samsung Electronics Co.

The company's flagship unit, Toshiba Corporation, also reported a second-quarter loss after a weaker-than-expected first quarter. It also cited its losses on U.S. operations and restructuring costs, contributing to an expected loss in the current quarter.

The company had 524.4 billion yen in net income, while a year earlier it had 548.5 billion yen.

While Japan's economy may have been hurt by the earthquake, analysts said the company's restructuring will help to stabilise earnings. Toshiba has already cut losses over the years.

The company had been a huge player in the country's home-electronics sector for decades but saw profitability deteriorate. Its revenue fell 27.8 percent to 23.1 trillion yen last fiscal year.

Toshiba shares edged up 0.4 percent in Tokyo trading after the announcement.
