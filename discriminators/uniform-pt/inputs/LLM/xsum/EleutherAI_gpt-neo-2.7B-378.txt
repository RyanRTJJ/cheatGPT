 for a variety of reasons such as having a chronic illness, surgery, chemotherapy or being widowed or divorced. It says children and the elderly should not necessarily have to suffer before being treated and that more needs to be done to help people with long-term conditions such as cancer.

The charity is asking for all public bodies to work together on the review of policies and changes to the way that disability is measured and reported.

The report is due to be published in the spring, the charity said.

The charity also set out five key recommendations and called on all public bodies to review their policies, systems and contracts to ensure they address the needs of disabled populations.

It cited government efforts to address disability and the increasing numbers of people with serious long term conditions that, it says, has resulted in a series of challenges for people trying to maintain a good quality of life despite their impairment that are being tackled via a range of initiatives.

Among other things, the charity called for more to be done to support young people with long term conditions.

A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said: "The welfare reforms introduced by the coalition in 2010 are fundamentally designed to help all people, whatever their circumstances, into work, support themselves and remain in work.

"We know there are disabled people in receipt of in-work support, and the coalition government is investing £200 million a year to help disabled people into work, through a disability and employment strategy.

"The welfare reforms included a new disability living allowance for people with long term conditions, which brings in £180 a week which can provide some of the cost of treatment for people who need it on low incomes."

She said a new "mixed" national disability equality framework, which will provide the necessary framework for a wider range of activities, was being released on Monday.
