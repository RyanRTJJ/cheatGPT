 will provide an open source project that will help to build edX "an open, collaborative project community that connects learners, researchers, and innovators to advance education with high-quality and open, free and open-source educational materials." This effort has been spearheaded since 2010 in partnership between MIT, Harvard and other institutions.

"With the growing demand for online education, we realize we must do more to support and engage learners as we are building a new generation of scholars, teachers, and learners. Our unique and growing academic community is part of the solution to advancing higher education across the world and helping students find meaningful employment, furthering their education, and contributing to our world," said UT president Bill Powers.

"We believe edX will become a powerful tool for the next generation of higher educators across the world that will be an incredible asset to higher education," Dean of Harvard's EdX program, Jim Goldman said. "Our partnership with UT is an important start to a new and important project to bridge the gap between innovative thinking and data-driven learning through open-access courses and technology that will provide a critical component of the global education workforce."

The collaboration between MIT and UT will offer students who attend UT a unique opportunity to interact with professors, scholars, and researchers on the edX-MIT platform. EdX provides a suite of online courses using edX OpenCourseWare (OCW), a collaboration between Harvard and MIT. The courses are designed with both faculty members and community participants in mind, providing students with an opportunity to learn something new, in theory as well as on the ground of practice. Course materials and material is also shared on the EdX-MIT platform over a number of social media platforms.

The edX community is growing and includes more than 3,600 students and scholars and nearly 25 organizations participating. In addition, the platform allows people to contribute materials and courses by downloading and using an online platform to collect, organize, and share course materials, as well as to participate in the edX OpenCourseWare and MIT-led open research community.
