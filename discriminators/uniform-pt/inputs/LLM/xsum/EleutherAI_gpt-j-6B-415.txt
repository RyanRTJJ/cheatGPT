, was based on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, in the Inner Hebrides, and he had been skippering the skiffs for 18 years. The boat had been built in 1999 using an almost identical hull and sail plan from the famous Cheeki Ruki, one of the best-known Scottish windsurfers, created in 1996 by skipper and designer Ian Ferguson, and which had won the World Windsurfing Tour seven times. It was a stunning piece of sailing equipment, light and fast, and when it sank the team began to fear the worst.

As part of the investigation, Douglas Innes examined the mast closely in his workshop, and he told me that when he took the mast apart to examine it, he noticed that, in the place where riggers drill the bolt holes, there were holes around each end of the shrouds and the topsides but, in a pattern which corresponded exactly with the rigging, and which he could not explain, were not where rigging would be expected on a mast that he knew was built to a particular standard.

He had the mast reassembled with the holes correctly spaced and asked a friend who had also built boats, to check if he could see the same pattern. So, when he saw the skipper’s report in which he commented that the position of two holes and the hole position on the shrouds of the mast did not match up, and when he found pictures of some rigging on a website that looked like the rigging on his mast, he was certain he had been made a fool of.

He showed me pictures of the rigging on the mast which confirmed that the rigging appeared on the mast where he had drilled the holes incorrectly. But even with two independent sets of eyes watching the rigging it wouldn’t come loose. They couldn’t figure out why a standard rigging wouldn’t fall off.

The rigging problem on the mast had nothing to do with the rigging or
