 10,000 years ago, and may have been aged about 50 to 60 when he became ill.

They believe he was buried with his arms around his side, which is the posture of one "who is resting, or kneeling".

The position of the hips relative to the trunk - so called "hip ratio" - suggests the man was of athletic build.

'Human ancestor'

Analysis of DNA from this individual showed the individual had no European or Afro-Eurasian ancestry, but was a descendant of an Asian human ancestor.

The results show this individual is a representative of the earliest populations of the area - from which modern humans arose and which now are extinct.

The discovery is the oldest human fossil ever found in the UK, and is more than twice as old as the oldest human fossils found in Africa, including a 200,000-year-old skull found in Ethiopia.

It has been described as the largest fossil excavated in the UK since the Bronze Age.

The University of York has received international interest from around the world for the find, which is part of the International Institute of Archaeology.

"York is extremely proud to be the UK home of this discovery," said Professor Chris Stringer from the university, who led the excavation.

"This archaeological discovery was made by a dedicated community, and is evidence of the ancient world preserved beneath St John's College and in the immediate environment.

"We are determined to share the story of such intriguing scientific findings with the world.

"We are pleased this finding, and many others, will be displayed at York Art Gallery with a major exhibition in 2017."

The results of genetic testing on the remains are to be confirmed, but it seems likely the analysis will show the bones belong to the same species as the ancient European and Neanderthal remains found throughout the UK and in northern Germany.

Although the specimen has been excavated, the find could not be scientifically dated until scientists knew more about the
