aghan Museum are collaborating to tell the tale in the form of an interactive audio-video exhibition designed to bring museum-goers back to the Somme.

In The Forgotten Years, The Somme was ‘a place both of horror and of pride,’ wrote Brian Brennan in The Last Great War (1983). It became a battleground where human lives were stretched to breaking point, where human courage was tested and tested again. And the people who fought through it came to understand themselves, and others, at the darkest core of war.

While the First World War lasted into its sixth year in 1916, the Somme was to be the longest battle fought by the British Empire. As the trenches came to embrace the whole of Belgium, soldiers, many fighting for their lives, lived out the final months of an ordeal they never thought they could survive.

The Somme is also remembered as the turning point of World War II, the battle which changed the course of the war, the war from which no other battlefield came so close with such terrible cost: The Germans lost 1,500,000 men but the Germans lost the battle of least blood; the British lost 1,000,000 men, the Australians 500,000.

It was the German Army’s greatest victory at the Western Front, and one of their most successful strategic operations.

For the first few days of the battle, General Sir Douglas Haig was convinced that his army had been badly outmaneuvered by the German High Command, who had gained a huge advantage through their surprise attack. The German Army had prepared meticulously for this assault, knowing of Haig’s intentions.

But they were outmanoeuvred, and soon the British Army’s hopes for salvation appeared to be in the balance. In what became known as ‘the bloodiest day in British history,’ the British Army collapsed.

The Battle of the Somme (1916) began with a small French attack. But by the end of the first day, it had escalated to a five-hour battle by the evening of 9 July.
