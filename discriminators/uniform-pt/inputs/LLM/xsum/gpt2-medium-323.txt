After the EU and Italy imposed restrictions last year, Syrians and Eritreans who had managed to cross to Egypt to try to get to Italy became trapped inside the nation, and were arrested.

It said there are also plans for a refugee camp at the Syrian naval base near the Libyan town of Benghazi, with the camp likely to accommodate up to a thousand in addition to the already approved Syrian refugees.

But France on Wednesday called on Germany to open more refugee centres in Libya.

Luxembourg's interior minister Jan Jambon said authorities had opened "several more" asylum requests in Italy since France tightened asylum rules, saying that some families with children had not been able to enter and that migrants from Syria and other conflict areas are "living and sleeping in the camps".

The new camp was seen as an expansion of a proposed tent camp close to the border with Algeria, and it could be one of many such developments in the coming weeks.

According to Frontex data, the number of arrivals by the Turkish coastguard between March and October was 1,569, followed by Syrians at 447, and Eritreans at 489, followed by people fleeing war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan.
