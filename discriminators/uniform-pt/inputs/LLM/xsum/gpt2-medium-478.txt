 a police officer as 'like a football ground' on the day.

Two officers and six police vehicles were hit between the fans.

Officers spent several minutes trying to stop the crowd but there was constant confusion. The crowd, which numbered about 130,000, continued to build until it had swelled to between 2,000 and 2,500 people by about 8pm, one security source said.

The final whistle went just after 10.20pm.

Galloway Street was closed for hundreds of metres and the street was blocked off as officials attempted to find out what caused the crush.

As part of the investigation, a team from the PSNI, Scotland Yard's counter crime team, a team from Scotland Yard's national crime unit, Edinburgh officers, two teams of emergency vehicles including traffic patrol cars and road crews attended the stadium. Scotland Yard is also investigating the incident.

Chief Constable Mike Rowley, a senior officer based at Glasgow City Police, said: "Our thoughts and prayers are with the fans who have lost their lives at Hampden."

Rioters had targeted players from both teams as they left the stadium from the Olympic Centre, before they tore down the giant Glasgow City football fanship. The football fanship, which stood on half-pipes and was packed to bursting with hundreds of fans, had suffered serious damage and now faces collapse, the force was reported to have said.

Police and emergency staff on the scene described a "bizarre frenzy" following the scenes. While two security police officers were trampled by a tram, one was knocked away.

One police officer, from the north-west of England, lay prone when he stumbled across a crowd but doctors were able to save his life. An Edinburgh emergency service paramedic injured himself near the ground after a flash flood struck the stadium, in what the Met Police said was the first time it had ever been reported that an Edinburgh ambulance had fallen victim to water.

It is not clear how many injuries are being treated in Scotland Yard's three injured service, Scotland Yard sources said.
