The Trust is also working with local authorities to assess the risk that the seal might cause to fishing and aquaculture operations, and to look into ways to protect fish stocks and fishing businesses. In the event that the seal continues to feed on the wrong type of diet, the Trust may initiate a seal ‘management strategy’ which could involve the use of scarers and repellents.
