e thinking "if we just put the money in, and don't pay attention to how it's being spent, then things will happen".

Sir Derek said there was a need for senior leaders to understand the impact of spending decisions and to ensure resources were targeted at the areas of highest need.

"It is going to be very difficult for the country to deliver on its policy agenda or for any governments - whatever their political colour - to meet the challenges of the future," he said.

Sir Derek said departments needed to ensure resources were not just being spent in a "dittied andbitty way, which lacks efficiency".

He said that making changes to the way public services were delivered, whether through large-scale reforms or through small-scale projects, often needed to be done "in a, careful and thoughtful way".

Sir Derek said there was a need to ensure that public money was used in a way that brought the "greatest benefit" to the taxpayer. He said this should be done in a way that showed the impact of spending decisions.

Sir Derek said there was a need for policy makers to think about how the NHS, the police and other services were being run in the most effective way and that spending decisions should be linked to an understanding of what works best to improve services.
