 what many of her elders view as the brutality of the process and decides to stand up and fight for Scotland's cultural and natural heritage.

The author has just received the "Best of the Best" award from the Scottish Association for Women in Literature - an award that includes $5,000 to improve the novel and Â£4,900 for other things.

Henderson wrote Fir for Luck with Scotland's historic and current history in mind.

'Cultural heritage is in danger'

"Fir for Luck tells the story of a girl, Tamsin, in the Highlands of Scotland when the Highland Clearances are brought to an end," Henderson said.

"After the clearing of the Highlands for firewood, a small group of people, the MacFarlanes, come up from Donegal with their livestock. The women have been left behind, and to them this is a way to be reunited with the people they have lost.

"But their way of life is in danger. The men of the macfarlanes think they will kill the women, in a way that will bring the clearances to an end.

"Tamsin decides to fight back and save her culture and her people. She finds the strength of her own character and also learns from the others who share her fate."

Henderson wanted to write about the Highland Clearances, but was not sure how to do it justice. She decided to base the story on real events from the 1920s and 1930s.

"I think what Fir for Luck has to do with those times is, it makes me realise how close I was to my grandparents," she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.

"They moved from west London to a small town on the western coast of Scotland and it seems really strange to think that their children are from the same background."

'The best thing for me'

"I think I'll use some of the money from the literary award for writing a short story, a novella, the best story I can write in the three months I have left."

Henderson has won many prizes for her work, including the Women's Prize
