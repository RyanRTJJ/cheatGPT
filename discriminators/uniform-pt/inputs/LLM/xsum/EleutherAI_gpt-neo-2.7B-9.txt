 each other, but when I do see her, I like to look at her all warm and smiling, always asking why I let her go," Valerii said. "That's not the look that comes over her if a man stands in front of her. And it's not the way I feel."

Gorka, 41, is a former ballet dancer with the Bolshoi, where she was a principal ballerina from 1999 until 2003. She has been married to her partner for five years, but she and Valerii separated before her marriage ended. "When we went on the trip, I felt very bad that I was not a very important person. You can't live with someone when you only see them once a week all year. It's really hard."

Gorka said she didn't believe Valerii had a problem keeping a lid on their relationship "because she doesn't pay enough attention to the people around her" and would sometimes tell Valerii something to try and hurt her husband's feelings. Valerii said her husband didn't understand why she didn't pay more attention to her career and he resented the fact that she didn't have time for her husband.

"She has gone through so much and she's done very well; I can't blame her for not being there for me," Valerii said.

In a letter to the judges that was shown on state television, Valerii said he was going to fight her because he never believed her story.

"I will lose this battle. She started it all. Her lies and lies spread fast and then she got scared and cried when she couldn't use the lies, and now she's gone, with her lies," Valerii wrote.

"But it doesn't change anything. You have your own problems, we have our own problems. I will not sit back and watch my future wife cry and regret things that have happened. I will not allow her to do it anymore."

Voter's remorse?

The verdict could cause voters to reconsider how much remorse they feel for the mistakes they previously took so
