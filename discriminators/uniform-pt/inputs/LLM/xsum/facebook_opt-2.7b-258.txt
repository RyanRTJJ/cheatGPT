 11 nations in 1995, with the number of entrants rising to 12 in 1999.

The Rugby Football Union's chief executive Andy Cosslett admitted the organisation is under "a tremendous amount of strain". "We have had to close down several regional affiliates due to a number of factors and we are continuing to review our costs and are looking at all the options available to protect the future of the union," he said in a statement.

The union said it had made savings of £10m to £12m in its 2015/16 financial year. "The RFU has made significant sacrifices this financial year to ensure the sport's survival and to ensure the survival of rugby in England and Wales in a rapidly changing global environment.

"The RFU and unions in all three nations (Scotland, Wales and Ireland) must compete in a financially stable environment to maintain the very high levels of participation we currently enjoy," added Cosslett.

Rugby league great and former England captain Paul 'Winkie' Raimondo described the proposed changes as "outrageous". "The biggest problem facing all of rugby is that the game as a whole will not be able to deliver for all its stakeholders until it can make a profit," he said. "In the face of rising debts and the threat of the game's death, the RFU could have turned to the commercial arms of various parties to help save the game but they, instead, have turned to the players.

"The players must now accept that the only way to secure their long-term financial futures is to accept some form of contractionary and revenue sharing deals."

The union stated earlier this year that it expected to post a loss of £1m in the 2015/16 season caused by a slump in ticket sales, sponsorships and television broadcasting. The union has also been forced to scale back on its training programmes for internationals while facing massive losses of £30m from sponsorship revenues each season.

In addition, the RFU made a £2m loss last season after the international tournament between England and Australia in late June.
