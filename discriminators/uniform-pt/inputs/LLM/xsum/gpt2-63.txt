 reporters, one of the "biggest challenges" he is facing in dealing with the rising cost of public services.

"It hasn't been easy to build our national infrastructure," he warned of the government's "challenging policies" which have pushed down the price of public services in some of Britain's busiest cities.

He said the government's "defining vision" for tackling rising costs was to build more state-of-play hospitals and free schools while paying the public service £3bn a year.

He criticised those who had insisted the government should take responsibility for rising living standards by promising a "new welfare state".

"If this has never been our dream, it is probably as simple as taking responsibility for rising living standards … It would be a better world, like our nation states."

In what could be the first major foreign intervention, the prime minister, John Major, said Scotland had "made historic" cuts to the pensions of Scottish and English pensioners, in an interview with the Sunday Times.

On Labour, he said: "When you ask the question'should Britain become a democracy or is it just about keeping the people in the front line'? Well, the answer is no, Britain doesn't need more national government."

Major said that Scotland has been put "on a path to recovery, not just for its people but also for the rest of Scotland, for the good people in other parts".

But he insisted he did not want to become a single country.

"If we want that, we would do it ourselves. And we can do it as a community, and we can do it within our own country," he told reporters.

"But we need a different way to do it on the basis of the facts and the values of the country".

"We just don't do it or we don't deliver," his spokesman added.

Mr Major added: "There are things that people want from Westminster about government and that's it, they can be happy about or they can be unhappy about it.
