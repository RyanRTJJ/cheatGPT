But the news comes with good news for Castleford, with prop James Graham still yet to go under the knife for a knee operation.

Director of rugby Steve McCormack said: "The injury wasn't quite as bad as first thought.

"Adam is now starting to make a bit of progress and is looking good to be back for the club within three months."

Castleford had little joy in a dull derby at Leeds Rhinos, despite an outstanding effort from centre Kris Burton, who was named man of the match.

Burton scored six tries and kicked four goals in a man-of-the-match performance on his return from a knee injury that forced him to miss half of last year.

He was also voted joint man-of-the-match ahead of wing Kevin Locke and props Jake Webster and James Chester, who kept Rhinos in it with two last-ditch tackles on his opposite number Jonny Lomax.

McCormack believes Burton's form could be a major boost for the Tigers.

"Kris' performance was outstanding for the Tigers this weekend," he said.

McCormack told BBC Yorkshire: "His try was just off-the-cuff, he's very good technically and he runs like a train.

"I can't say what we're going to do with Kris yet, but he was very impressive.

"He had a couple at the weekend that were absolutely fantastic, his defensive effort in particular, it was outstanding."

'Very difficult to win'

Rothmans director of rugby Brian Noble took up his role with Castleford at the start of the season and admitted it remains to be seen if his side can go up.

After a 10th-placed finish last season, Castleford won just two games after the turn of the year - both in their last three outings.

Noble said: "That will prove to be very difficult for us to get going. I think we will have to make a good start, it's very difficult to win at the moment.

"Our expectation is to go down there, make sure we turn up, play our game and win.
