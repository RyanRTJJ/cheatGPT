 which is part of the Piccadilly line, to be halted.

The delays were caused by a signalling fault at a tunnel entrance, and Ms Nellist said she took a commuter bus to the station from where she got underground.

"Everything was still running, so when I got to Wood Green it was pretty slow. On the platform I could see the driver taking people back to the ticket office. The conductor shouted back 'you can't go in, there's no one there'," she said.

The bus made another stop before Mr Bannister arrived. She waited for 50 minutes before leaving at around half-past 7am.

"It was quite nice being able to see the trains, even though they were all at a standstill," said Ms Nellist, who only caught four trains during the disruption.

The Met Office said conditions were likely to improve today and tomorrow, with maximum temperatures in London reaching 15C by tomorrow.

Northern warned passengers could still expect to face "severe service interruption" on Monday, with only around a third of normal services running.

Northern CEO Chris Grayling told MPs on two cross-party transport select committees on Wednesday morning that one of the reasons for the disruption was a failure to replace train crew who left for annual leave on Wednesday.

He said a replacement team were set to be ready to run trains by 7am on Thursday, when the new timetable is brought in.

"For now, we're asking our customers to take extra care and reduce travelling - for example, consider travelling outside peak hours when possible," said Mrs Grayling.

"On top of that, we've done an extra service last night to ensure we could clear the stations in an appropriate order."

She added that the new timetable for the West Central line - due to start running from 9am on Friday morning - is ready and will be operated by the new team.

Northern has also apologised to commuters for the disruption caused to the East Coast Mainline last week after a train struck a bridge pillar in East Sussex.
