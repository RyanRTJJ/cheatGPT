 their request, and the council in March decided to tear it down so that it could be redeveloped.

Now this year, in the run-up to St James' Park Opening Day, the City's land use subcommittee will be discussing the future of a similar market at St George's Church Street, which it recently ruled must be saved under city planning law.

The market, which opened in 1884, was one of the city's most successful and most sought-after selling points. At the bottom of the market's staircase, a collection of 18th-century silver jewellery and gilt glass plates, as well as pottery, were on sale.

The market was a hot place for trade throughout Victorian-era London, selling to as many as 11,000 people a day. But in 2008, its stalls and stalls inside the city walls, where it was housed under the ownership of the National Trust, became a black spot for crime and disorder.

Last year, a three-week trial run at the former St James' Church St was found to be a successful improvement and resulted in a significant return in sales at the shop's remaining stall.

A number of residents expressed anger at the council's decision to knock down the market and rebuild elsewhere.

They argued the market was an important part of the neighbourhood, as it was the main selling point for new residents who moved in in the 1930s.

In an email to business groups, Caroline Dyer from the National Trust said the council's reasoning was "a bit weak".

"The market was one of the most successful and desired selling points for a significant section of new London residents in 1948," she wrote in the email.

In response, a spokeswoman for the council, which owns the land, referred back to its land use policy; in that policy, the council said "a suitable new area should be established to continue to bring market activity to St James' Park".

She added that any new area had to be designed to "allow for the future future success" of the market.

The spokesperson said the market was a "vital commercial asset" for St James' Park, which was "the new home" of the national cricket
