 "maintain their own Twitter followers" while deleting tweets deemed "insensitive". (Some of the content was retweeted thousands of times and has since been removed.) In a statement, Twitter apologised for the incident and expressed its "heartfelt disappointment" at the "unacceptable" actions of staff who were being punished.

"We have found this to be totally unacceptable and have communicated that directly to the account holders affected. As a result, accounts which have been affected are temporarily disabled until appropriate procedures can be put into place," it said.

The department has also confirmed that it intends to review all of its staff' Twitter accounts to ensure that "every possible precaution is put in place to ensure the same standards of social media behaviour and behaviour do not exist". As well as a Twitter review, all staff have been asked to sign a code of conduct, which aims to "minimize the possibility that staff will engage in or publicly engage in conduct that is offensive or inflammatory". At this stage, the Facebook and Google accounts linked to employees have not had a Twitter account removed so nothing has been formally revealed to allow the department to make recommendations about whether to conduct a further review.

The social media industry has been "incredibly slow" to address the problem, Kostelnick said, explaining that when it comes to abuse people were "incredibly vulnerable".

Facebook's own abuse-tracking policies also seem to be failing when it comes to users who want to protect their data. Many of the Facebook accounts linked to employees are run by individuals who have recently left their positions, some of whom have said, with some justification, the consequences of being exposed online. Twitter has responded by saying it takes abuse, and the threats,
