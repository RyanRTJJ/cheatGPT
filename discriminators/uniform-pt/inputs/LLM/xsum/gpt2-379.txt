 of Ireland in the poll for second place.

The World Cup quarter-finals are out of the question, the Wales manager Kevin Pietersen said during his pre-match press conference.

"I said two things to our players and our staff, and I've said it before.

"We need to make sure we are playing in the same cup as the other four countries and our teams."

England's first ever World Cup quarter-finals will be a must for Pietersen and his side of the field - including a trip to Brazil on Friday - in 2019 after the end of the World Cup. The England international is on loan from Denmark.

"We want to be very clear that we are against the first World Cup ever," Pietersen said, speaking during his pre-match press conference following victory over England.

"Of course the other eight teams, the team in Brazil will be very happy with that at the moment.

"I see it as the best we can do for our young teams at the moment."

He was asked about being among the few players who have not taken part in an international match against Switzerland.

"It may not be a surprise," he said.

"There are plenty of players that really came through and really came through as a team. I've had good time in training but it was a nice surprise and not just a surprise, a different surprise.

"The other important thing for me is that everyone deserves to represent the best in the world, which is my real goal. Our opponents are very hard to beat so I am happy with the way the game is going.

"We have the opportunity there to show what we can do and we have the opportunity to show that we will do it."
