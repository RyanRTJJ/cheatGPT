He’s also charged with defrauding the Government of nearly $15,000 by failing to disclose the 2011 purchase on a federal income tax return.

This is something that Mr. Trudeau says he did not do.

Mr. Trudeau’s lawyers have argued that there’s a reasonable doubt in the case and Mr. Trudeau did not do anything illegal.

But as for the issue of disclosure on the federal income tax, the court found there was sufficient evidence to show that Mr. Trudeau did not inform the RCMP about the 2011 purchase.

However, the court found that Mr. Trudeau knew of the need to disclose it. Mr. Trudeau was first informed about the RCMP investigation into the 2011 purchase in August 2019, while the matter was being examined.

As it turns out, Mr. Trudeau’s father, Pierre Elliot Trudeau, also paid a steep price for his past indiscretions.

He was charged with conspiracy and the bribery of a public official in relation to a Montreal arms deal in the 1980s for which both he and his father pleaded not guilty.

There’s no love lost where the corruption court is concerned. Its judges have even gone so far as to say some of the individuals named in the case should “shut the f— up and go back to where they came from.”

Mr. Trudeau didn’t attend Wednesday’s court appearance.

No date has been set for his trial.
