There is no suggestion there are any links with the attack on the Tube.

The Government's Home Secretary was recently accused of trying to stop the naming of a paedophile groom by naming the suspect in the killing of a British Army intelligence officer.

On the BBC's Panorama programme she described the case as the "biggest crime scene in this country".

But the Metropolitan Police said on the programme it had uncovered no new information.

In London, a spokesman for Operation Midland confirmed the discovery of a large file of child sex abuse victims.

In Southwark in south London a dozen young people had been identified as victims or at risk of CSE. The officers all knew each other from the force's Cumbria service - which is dealing with suspected child sexual exploitation cases.

A spokesman said there had been no investigation into the children and this was a joint investigation by the Met, London Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre and Southwark borough officers from all seven forces.

Suffolk Cumbria's Deputy Assistant Chief Superintendent Peter Mays told the BBC's Newsnight programme that the South Surrey Police Service (SSP SBS) was now "committed to supporting the victims and their families" through the Cumbria investigation.

But the officer involved in the alleged grooming has not been named because of the sensitive nature of the investigation.

He has been working with victims and their families for nine months and will stay in the role until an investigation is completed, the SSP told the BBC.

Police officers will be interviewed immediately and then the Cumbria investigations team would be appointed to investigate.

'We are in the grip of a very serious crisis'

But one senior politician - who was not named - told the BBC his fears "really hit home and I think you are seeing more of them" as the investigation continues.

Conservative councillor Chris Rutter said: "I think people are very scared. I think all people in these communities are now in it together and the vast majority who are struggling with this are very vulnerable.

"We know what has happened to all the other victims. These men, these women, have been through hell."
