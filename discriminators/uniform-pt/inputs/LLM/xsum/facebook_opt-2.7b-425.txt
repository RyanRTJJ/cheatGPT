 patrol in Nahr-e Saraj on Saturday, according to media reports. The two-day-long operation has been launched to detain terrorist leader Abu Sayyaf, who masterminded the recent bombing in Marawi.

The two mariners were conducting a counter-assessment of the location where they had been conducting surveillance when the explosion in Nahr-e Saraj took place.

They were searching for terrorists and when the explosion happened, they died on the spot from the explosive materials the improvised bomb contained.

The operation to arrest the terrorist leader is part of the ongoing military campaign in Marawi called "Operation Grand Slam" that started on May 23. The military is trying to retake Marawi city amid ongoing clashes between rebels and government troops.

As of 5 p.m. that day, the military has recovered seven improvised bombs, two of them were detonated in the operation area while the others destroyed by ordnance technicians.

"We have recovered seven IEDs and one improvised bomb," Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla Jr., commander of Joint Task Force Marawi, said in a statement. "These IEDs represent a significant threat to our troops and the communities surrounding the area."

Padilla said most of the IEDs were planted by the same terrorist leader the forces are seeking. He has been identified only as "Bebek" or "Ras".

Padilla said they are still investigating if Ras is linked to the bombing at Moro Field Training Area in Sulu last week, which was reported by the military to be the work of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) or if it is an individual behind the attack.

The government said at least eight military personnel were among the 57 civilians killed and 130 were injured in that bombing.

"We are sure that this was an IED attack carried out by members of Marawi-based terror group MNLF," National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr. said.

The military has already destroyed IEDs planted in two separate instances in Marawi.

The military has not announced plans to recapture Marawi City.
