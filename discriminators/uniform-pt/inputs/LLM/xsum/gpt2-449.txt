 online course that, if offered, would bring in £1 billion a year and would be offered online by the NHS under the "Better Health Service" umbrella.

The £1 billion was a "coup d'etat" and the plan calls for an "integrated approach," with universities using more than 40 new online courses, which include online courses as well as online courses that are offered in English or Irish.

This will ensure the system is working to build up a community of learners and students with access to the latest information.

"An online course can help ensure that a particular health service is providing that healthcare service and is delivering a positive response to health problems."

He urged the Government to start using the online curriculum, rather than relying on traditional teaching, as being the "best course of therapy". He said that "a very large number of primary care doctors do not want to get into online courses".

Professor Pritchard's comments come from an earlier statement by Professor Pritchard, who is now a Fellow of the Oxford Centre for Science and Policy and a research Fellow at the Institute of Medicine where he served as the chief scientific adviser.

His latest statement comes at a time when the NHS, in particular NHS England,
