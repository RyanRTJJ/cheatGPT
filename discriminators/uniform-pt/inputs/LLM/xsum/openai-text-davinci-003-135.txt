Detective Chief Inspector Rob Griffin, of Nottinghamshire Police, said the force was pleased with the progress being made in the investigation, which was launched more than two years ago.

He said: "The majority of those we have arrested and interviewed are former members of staff who were employed at the homes between the late 1950s and the early 1990s."

In December 2017 the chief executive of Nottinghamshire County Council, John Rhodes, said the authority was sorry for its failure to keep children at Beechwood safe from abuse. The apology came after an independent inquiry found there had been a lack of oversight by the local authority into what was going on at Beechwood.

DCI Griffin said the force was working closely with the council to ensure appropriate supports and guidance are offered to victims.

He added: "It's very important to remember, though, that there are victims here and my team are absolutely committed to trying to identify who they are and to make sure they receive the support they may need."

The police investigation has widened in recent months and officers have been visiting other former children's homes in the area.

DCI Griffin said: "This has been a complex and complex investigation and has involved considering hundreds of documents, and it has taken a considerable amount of police resource to get to this stage.

"I want to thank all those who have participated in our work so far and I am truly thankful to all those who have provided information and shared their stories with us."

He said that while they have made significant progress, they still need to hear from potential victims.
