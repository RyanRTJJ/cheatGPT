squad, Aborah is not necessarily the first choice to be picked, however he is "very much wanted and is a fantastic player".

While Aborah has not made an appearance since the departure of Moniz, Fullarton insisted the club would continue to monitor his progress and will not rule out using him in the future. He said: “We are still monitoring his situation. He is a great professional, highly respected in the squad and it is important for us that he feels like he is part of it. I am very confident that he will be given a chance to shine at some stage this season.”
