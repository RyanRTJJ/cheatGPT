 who ran 15:08.42, his personal best.

"I was running a few times under 3:20 and then on Saturday and Sunday training we did a 10km warm-up and then in the first heat I managed to run 7:38 for 6k," Colgan said.

"I didn't think it was impossible, I just don't know if I was able to pull it out. I was on a plane the next morning so I was a bit tired, I'm just lucky I got into the final."

Despite that disappointment, Colgan is determined to make the next Olympics in Rio, despite not being one of the favourites to make it to that Games.

She says it's all about getting past the last hurdle as it looks like the distance is too hard for any of the other British women, who will be hoping to run on and improve their times next week.

"Obviously I'm not going to lie, it might be frustrating, I don't think anyone can accept it," Colgan said.

"I'll start from where I left off and I'll see where I can improve. I think I can do a whole lot better than what I have done so far."

Colgan's 10,000m silver and bronze from the 2008 and 2012 worlds are the only British medals at this summer's Games.
