 experience, in which they were forced to consider the consequences of the vote that they had cast.

But when the result was announced, it was almost as if the public had been asked to consider whether Brexit would be a disaster or a success. In the referendum campaign, the media consistently argued that membership would be a disaster for Britain – a threat to peace and prosperity, a loss of influence. This campaign was full of sound and fury, but with few exceptions the press was silent on the side of victory. The British people were then told that leaving the EU would somehow make us richer, stronger and more secure.

The campaign for Leave was fought on a basic economic basis which was repeated in much of the press coverage: what exactly were the benefits for Britain of joining the EU? One headline on the BBC said that the UK would leave the EU with a £350m a week surplus, not necessarily £350m a week more in the public purse but more than in the previous decade. A piece in the Guardian, which ran in the very few weeks before polling day, argued that Brexit could ‘solve Britain’s biggest problem’. At the time, the economic argument was all that counted, and most of what remained of the economic argument had long since disappeared. The real-life arguments that mattered to the Leave campaign now involved the future of the country, and there were many.

The Leave campaign had been undermined by many factors but this one, which remained largely unseen, had the greatest impact. A majority of the British public was now fed up with both parties, which could no longer deliver in the national interest or govern effectively. And for some on the Leave side, the evidence of economic failure offered a chance for a revolution, a national awakening. These people were willing to believe what they wanted to believe. A majority of Britons did, too, and it seems this vote was driven by an exaggerated sense of optimism.

Of course, economic arguments were also central to the Remain side of the argument, albeit in terms that were different to the Leave campaign.
