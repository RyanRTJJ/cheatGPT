) said it was investigating.

A spokesman said a staff member was hit and several staff members were affected. There were no injuries to prisoners when the inmate was struck around 10.40pm.

He said: "This man was struck by a sharp object from a distance of around seven metres and is expected to require several weeks in hospital.

"This is an isolated incident which was thankfully not connected to another incident in January and March but rather due to weather.

"We are working closely with local authorities and with the Siptu authority to address any lingering issues affecting prisoners."

A spokesperson for the POA insisted the strike was "absolutely unacceptable".

He said: "Prison officers are members of the Public and Public Sector Authority - they are appointed by the Minister who is in charge of running prisons and they act as gate guards, support staff, and officers.

"They do no prison work, but are there to ensure that prisoners feel safe and secure and to protect them from threats and other forms of abuse."

The POA said that as the strike continues, it would look into all information in regards to any incidents. It said further comments would emerge "within due course".

The prison service did not say why the strike was called off until 6am on Thursday.

A spokesman added: "Prisons are under extreme strain and we must respond quickly to any issues that may arise when prisoners are present."


Staff are advised to "remain well-behaved and to use any means necessary" and to contact the appropriate authorities for advice, training and assistance.
