 took control of Ferrari last year before being transferred to Mercedes a few months later.

"I am very happy to have come to this decision," Massa said. "This is the right time for me. I am very happy at Ferrari and that was a decision that I had to make.

"It was a big step from Renault to Ferrari. They gave me a great team with a very talented driver. I wish them all the best for the future. I am happy now that this agreement has come to fruition."

The two parties also agreed that both parties must agree on salary before any contract can be signed.

Massa, who also has an agreement with McLaren, has been linked with Mercedes but the German company has also been searching for an out for the last year following the departure of their then-prime driver and team-mate Lewis Hamilton.

"Both drivers will get the chance to make their mark in the field, which they deserve," said Ferrari boss Stefano Domenicali.

"Felipe is a terrific young racer and has shown a great potential in 2014, and I am sure he will help to make the transition to his next challenge."

Mercedes has now gone seven wins short of Williams' 2011 record. The team is currently eighth.

"The Mercedes team achieved spectacular results in 2014 and now they join my personal team who are able to make it even more special," added F1 driver Jenson Button.

"I am very happy to be able to join them. It will be good for my personal development and the team's as well as for the drivers in general. I thank them for having made me feel welcome."

Massa joined McLaren in 1997 and set the quickest times in his first year in the team.

He has had an illustrious Formula 1 career, winning three championships and claiming the 2004 world title.

He retired in 2008 following a career slump at Renault, but remained on board until rejoining Ferrari in 2011.
