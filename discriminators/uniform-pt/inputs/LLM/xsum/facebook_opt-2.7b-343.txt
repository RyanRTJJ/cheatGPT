 - nobody has attended a single assembly debate.

After the vote on a first minister, the assembly debates are always the first session they'll attend. They'll attend any extra sessions on issues that haven't been voted on (such as the budget), but not the first session of the legislature.

I have a feeling those numbers are going *up* now that UKIP are having some success :P.

On the positive side, it seems like this could have been a more positive development for Labour than the previous election - given that a) we get to pick a new leader from amongst our more senior figures, and are likely to attract a lot of attention for whoever we put up and b) the Welsh public seem to be pretty unhappy with the lack of progress of the Assembly on so many issues.

But I do wonder if people will see her as anything other than someone desperate to leave the Assembly, not to be quite as extreme, but with much less credibility, and much more of a reputation as a bit of an arsehole.

It's unlikely to do much for her, but it could be a useful distraction.

Actually, it *might* be a positive. The fact that the Assembly is so much less relevant than it was a few years ago is good; that the Assembly has got to the point where it's only been a bit more relevant than it was a few years ago is bad. The fact that so many non-convenors can't bring themselves to vote in an Assembly debate is a bad thing for Wales; we should be getting through things there.

The Assembly could perhaps be doing better things with its resources - I'd love to know what the budget is and see a breakdown of what it's going into and how much of it is making the difference rather than what they're paying the people working for the Assembly to do. Or perhaps I'd love to see them doing better, but that's not going to happen, because they don't get any money from
