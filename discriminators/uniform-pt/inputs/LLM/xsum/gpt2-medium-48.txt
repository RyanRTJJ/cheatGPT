 some mistakes on the wrong strokes were getting us out on the front and away from the line," commented Knox. "But everything turned out OK in the end, we had a lot of good sessions for everybody here and there were some very good results."

"It's going to take more time to get to the final with each round, but the guys got here today and made it work, so I'm very proud of them."


Williams was replaced on by Tom Kostopoulos the next day after picking up a broken collarbone. On the first day following his injury, he said of his condition: "I think it's a very, very, very serious injury so that made getting through the day much easier so we have three days off, we've just got to be as positive as we can and get back as fast as we possibly can and get our points."
