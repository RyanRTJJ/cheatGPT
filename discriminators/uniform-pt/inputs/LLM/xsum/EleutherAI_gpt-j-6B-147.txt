 warned that problems like cancer and heart disease are spiralling out of control because of too much food, alcohol and obesity. There were too many foods, drinks and services promoting junk foods and alcohol, it said. And there was too much fat in our food. The BMA has called for "a fundamental review of the current system of food regulation to improve nutrition" and stop people over-exploiting food. "The NHS is often put under huge pressure to provide more resources, particularly into hospitals, and as a result we have seen a rising number of patients with obesity, obesity-related illnesses and alcohol misuse. This makes it even more important that we have effective regulation of food and drink, and that we can ensure that patients receive nutritious, nutritionally balanced food when visiting our hospitals," said Dr Mark Porter, the BMA's lead for nutrition and alcohol, and a GP in England's Humber region. But it is important that regulation does not stifle the creativity and innovation, he added. The Scottish government believes that too much regulation stifles innovation in food, drink and marketing of unhealthy products. A review of the rules for regulation of foods and drinks is in its early stages. If implemented, changes would be introduced to help consumers make informed nutritional choices. But it must also be practical and realistic, it argues. The changes will be a welcome boost for the food industry, which will be able to keep offering healthier diets, but are not expected to do much to tackle obesity rates. The review is being chaired by Lord Howell, and will examine what regulatory framework in the UK is best at preventing excessive weight gain.
