-330 is the type of aircraft with which the fault occurredâ€”but since it's an Airbus, he said, his department did not have to investigate further.

Aviation officials say the Air China pilot's decision to make a sharp approach to the taxiway before arriving at his destination is a known risk. Aviation experts estimate that the pilot of the Airbus H-330 would be at a risk of crash if his approach was not smooth (as opposed to making a sharp turn for landing). That risk is not limited to the pilots of commercial flights: According to a 2007 government report, an estimated 1,700 commercial flight crashes occur in China every year. They mostly take place when an unfamiliar pilot makes a sharp turn ahead of where the pilot expects to find his landing zone. The danger is especially acute while the aircraft is at a standstill.

The A6M2 Wolverine is the latest aircraft to suffer the fatal flaw in the C-137's approach. This year, more than two dozen aircraft have fallen prey to the same problem.

The C-27 is the latest military aircraft to suffer the problem: In February, Russian fighter pilot Alexei Kuznetsov died when his C-27 crashed in the Sinai desert, killing all three on board. While Russian officials say there's no official record of all accidents on Russian planes, they do attribute at least one of them to pilot error.

The C-137s that make up the American Air Force's new F-35 can be vulnerable to this problem as well. It may surprise some but the C-27 has twice crashed, most recently in January. Even when accidents are caught early, the planes are often left to rot and explode.
