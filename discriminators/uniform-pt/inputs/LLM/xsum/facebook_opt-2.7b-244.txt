This, he will add, is a choice of democracy versus "the chaos of Jeremy Corbyn and Labour" against "the continuity of David Cameron and the Conservatives".

A prime ministerial manifesto is typically used to present policies to voters a year before a general election. It is generally an expensive exercise and will be subject to scrutiny by party members before being published in full. But it represents the most important pledge of the election because it sets out how a prime minister will govern in office.

The Conservative document outlines plans for:

Making the NHS and schools the number one priority. Spending an extra £4.3bn a year by 2020. This includes paying an average 2.5% rise to teachers' pay by 2020 which would cost £8bn, extra support to tackle child poverty, and extra funds for free schools. It also promises to build the biggest new university in the University of North Wales.

An extra £3bn to be spent on infrastructure. This will include an extra 10,000 police officers, a £750m transport revolution and a £10bn National Shipbuilding Plan.

A stronger approach to crime. The prime minister is pledging to hire 100,000 extra police officers over a decade, which means doubling the number of police officers, with more being recruited into local police and increasing numbers of officers on frontline. Another 30,000 frontline officers would also be recruited in the criminal justice system.

A higher minimum wage, as a pilot scheme for £7.50 an hour, after the Bank of England announced it would raise the maximum threshold to £9 an hour after Brexit. The pilot would not include Wales but it would also cover Scotland. This is in contrast to Labour's plans to increase the real living wage for those aged 25 and over from £7.20 an hour to £10.10.

Grow Wales, a plan to develop Wales' economy. This would create new jobs through investment in high-skilled manufacturing and renewable energy. It also aims to ensure the UK achieves its carbon emissions target of 60% below 2005 levels by 2050.

Plans to help communities affected by industrial disasters in Wales by ensuring workers are consulted and protected when an incident occurs.
