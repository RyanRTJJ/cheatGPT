 security measures have been put in place, with police searching people and vehicles in the streets of the capital. Police are asking ordinary people to report any suspicious objects and are on high alert after an attack in Paris last Friday.

Laachraoui then tries to light a fuse on a black belt with a lighter, while his accomplice is seen standing next to him. The pair then speed off and get the van to get out of the station before the fuse is lit, the court was told.
