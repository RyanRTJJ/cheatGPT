 is no cure.

"This is a fungal infection of great global significance," he said.

"We now have a good clinical tool for this condition.

"We need to find someone to test this in to see whether it works on the global scale.

"And that somebody needs to be a big pharma company who don't really care a lot about fungi."

Dr Gow added: "If we can get to a place where a drug like this can be administered to children, adults and old people, it will be huge - for public health and the economy."

The fungus can affect any part of the body and can affect the heart, brain, lungs, skin, nerve, blood vessels, kidneys, eyes and other organs.

It is commonly known by the names a "heart-stopping" infection or an "anaphylactic shock-causing fungus".

Most deaths occur in areas with humid climates such as Africa, South America and Australia and in hospitals in hospitals.

And although most people recover with the right therapy, some people relapse and suffer severe, permanent side effects.

In one of the biggest trials of its kind, doctors in Italy and the UK studied the impact on more than 400 children with systemic fungal infections after a heart operation.

They reported that the drug was able to prevent death or severe complications in two of the children after three months of treatment.

The US company that made the drug, Galapagos, is also investigating whether it works in other conditions.

Prof Gow, head of the university's school of clinical microbiology and immunology, said: "We want people from all over the world to come to Aberdeen to try to find who this person is who can find and implement a treatment for this. We'll pay for that."

Dr Duncan McGlynn, president of the British Fungal Society, said the group has lobbied the European Medicines Agency to include systemic fungal infections on the EU list of diseases to qualify for a licence to drug patents - a move that could save hundreds of millions of pounds in research and development costs, freeing up funds for treating the global infection.
