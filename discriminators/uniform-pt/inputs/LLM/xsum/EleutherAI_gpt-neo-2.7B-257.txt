 and Jewish schools terrorised. There appears to be "zero tolerance" for Jewish schools and synagogues in our country. We must see this as a national security issue.

Jewish schools and synagogues have been attacked numerous times. At least 14 Jewish cemeteries have been desecrated with graffiti targeting Jewish holy sites, schools and Jewish religious sites. There have been incidents of vandalism at Jewish community centres, homes, hospitals, and even a synagogue. As far as I'm aware, none of the victims have received any form of financial compensation.

We are a country in which people of faith are targeted. We're a country whose politicians are more than happy to exploit that.

I want to focus on two specific issues. First, it is time that we have a national dialogue to educate ourselves on the challenges faced by Jewish organisations in the United States and the challenges faced by Jewish organisations here in Britain.

A recent article in Breitbart by Daniel Korski on the Jewish problem was an apt summary of why American Jews are targeted. It is a problem many of us know only too well.

Daniel then writes.

I’m a white, middle-class, educated Jew, and I don’t identify as a victim. Instead I identify as a journalist with a very public background who has written about this issue for months and years. I’m appalled that it is as bad as it is.

Daniel is a journalist and he needs to stop blaming America's Jewish community for the acts of the far-right.

But he isn’t a victim, he is just a person who has seen how Jewish communities must deal with terrorism, violence and hate.

In some ways, all of us are victims.

I am a white, working professional who has been active in the Jewish community for most of my life. I was active in my community as a child, going straight into community schools which were run by my parents and which included Jewish
