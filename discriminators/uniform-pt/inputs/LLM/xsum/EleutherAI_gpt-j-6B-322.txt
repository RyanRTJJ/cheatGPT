 and continued to drive while she got treatment.

In March 2010 her mother died at age 75. Her sister, Linda Miles, moved back into Ms. Marchbank and her father's home. By the end of June 2010 the house was deemed unsafe.

On May 7, 2010, The Globe and Mail wrote an article calling for an immediate moratorium on evictions of long-term tenants. "A moratorium would not change the economics — the cost of keeping these housing units is too high — but it would buy more time for tenants to fight," the article suggested. "These homes are the least wealthy part of Canada, and there's no chance a real estate developer will step up to create these units through an affordable housing initiative."

Because the rules were not written with the possibility of mortgages becoming a second mortgage on a primary residence. In order for Marchbank to buy her home she would need to first sell her home, or have her father or sister move in, and then use the proceeds to buy a new home.

Marchbank says her father and sister are "extremely reluctant" to take this course of action. "There's no other home where we could afford if we had the sale proceeds from this mortgage," she says. "There is no other home that would fit us, because it would require all three of us moving there. There are no properties for sale that would fit our needs financially."
