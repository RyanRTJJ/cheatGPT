 or even hold a referendum on the UK's future in the EU.

In a further sign of Mr Blair's concerns Britain risks being held back by the EU, Mr Clarke said such a move would be a "catastrophe".

The former top politician said he fears the financial services industry would have nothing to do with a UK economy without many EU markets after Brexit.

Mr Clarke dismissed the claim by some business leaders that the UK has benefited from its membership of the EU and has not paid a price for its membership.

"I think one of the things that many of us are looking for, and may actually get, is a much clearer perspective from Mr Cameron and others on what would happen then as a country with no place really in this.

"I think it would be quite a catastrophe. The impact of Brexit or not leaving would have dramatic consequences for Britain."

The comments were made before the Conservative party's recent revival in opinion polls by its pledge to hold a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU.

But, asked on ITV's Daily Politics if it was possible, Mr Clarke responded: "I think one way it could happen is we'll have a Conservative government and they will think about it, and I think the referendum will probably not happen.

"If then we get to the point where the country has voted against Brexit, then I think you'll have the prime minister in a very very difficult position, and that's how it is."

David Cameron believes a referendum on Britain's EU membership will win his party the next GE (General Election), and perhaps win him a second term
