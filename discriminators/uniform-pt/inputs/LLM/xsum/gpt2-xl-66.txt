 Ireland parish; Knocknagin is no longer a parish â€“ it became a Diocese in 2011. The Irish Constitution states that there must be two parishes in a territory but it does not have to make it mandatory.

A priest in Knocknagin told a local newspaper last night that the Diocese had recently confirmed a merger, and it has applied to be officially managed by the Roman Catholic Church.

It is understood that both Knocknagin and Desertmartin are to be merged within 24 months and that the new entity will serve all Catholic parishioners. It was said that all parishioners will be paid the same rates and there will be no cut in funding. Those who chose to remain in their parishes will be paid from the proceeds of the sale. There is some uncertainty as to the exact dates that the two parishes will be merged.

It is also said that there will be no Catholic priests in the new entity which has a mandate to be secular and is therefore not bound to observe Irish Catholic teachings or customs, even in their own place of worship.

The Irish Constitution recognises the Church of Ireland but does not have a requirement that parishes within it follow it in its spiritual life. The two priests at the centre of the controversy have said that the Church did not ask them to go against their spiritual beliefs but that they were not prepared to do that.

Both the Roman Catholic Church and Church of Ireland see their authority as one, but it is not clear whether the two entities can operate as one without breaking the law.

It is interesting to note that Irish law does not recognise a separation between the Catholic Church and secular entities that are not controlled by the Catholic Church. The Church of Ireland is controlled by the Irish Government and the Vatican, while
