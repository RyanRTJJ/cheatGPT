, the brother of Australia captain and four-time rugby league World Cup winner Phil, has told the Herald the family is still searching for answers and that while Australia's men's game has recently experienced a spate of high profile violence, it was no accident. Lockyer pointed to the death of AFL star Michael O'Loughlin in 2010 and the violent attack on the late NRL star Jason Dunstall as an indication that domestic violence had gone from being a "private matter" to a major issue. "This is not the first time it's happened. "The difference is everyone is now aware of it and it's getting the support it deserves," Lockyer said. "We have to look at it from a global perspective, because we have too many tragedies happening all over the world. "What's happening is what was happening years ago and now it's in the public eye. I'm not going to blame anyone for the fact men and women, at any given moment, may be at the hands of those we love." Rugby league great Greg Alexander, who is the father of NRL player and Kangaroos back Jai Arrow, said the attack on Dunstall reminded him of Dunstall's death. "In this era you think there's more awareness of domestic violence and there'll be some sort of repercussions," Alexander said. "But I don't know how many victims' families are out there that will say that's happened to them," Alexander said. "I don't know how anyone thinks that, let alone think something like that can get away with it." Alexander said there was a need to bring awareness to the topic, especially when players were at the height of their sporting careers. "Hopefully with all the publicity the issue gets brought to light and put to bed. "I know Jai is doing everything he can to protect himself and do everything possible to prevent that happening to him. He's still very open about where he's at mentally."
