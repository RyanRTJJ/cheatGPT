 his wife, a German tourist, in the area with her family.

The woman, who had a baby on the beach, was told to pay a $2,500 fine. If she did not, the fine would increase to between $6,000 and $10,000.

She has been warned not to return. The prince said the incident had been a "major disappointment", adding: "In principle I am against people who take'selfies' on the beach, but it was legal; there is no other way to take them."

The pictures were taken before a group of girls in short skirts, who apparently were taking selfies on the beach, saw the pictures and tweeted photos of the children.

The photos quickly went viral on Twitter, with the #SelfieFails trending on Sunday night.

Prince Harry's royal duties have increasingly placed him in situations in which privacy is expected. Last year, he was photographed alongside the Queen when she was playing golf at Balmoral. The image was used on posters by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's charity, Duchy of Cornwall Foundation, to raise funding.

Prince Harry is expected to wear a black waistcoat, black trousers and a white shirt when he attends a dinner at the Royal Ascot.
