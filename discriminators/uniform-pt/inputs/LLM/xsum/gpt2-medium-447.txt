 came in, the highest number recorded on that date in over two years.

As you may recall from when sales were up more than 13% in 2013, real estate developers like Toffler, Lothar & Co could still be able to sell their new homes in anticipation of the rising value of the pound – which will, of course, help lower their asking price.

Despite this, property owners were understandably very reluctant to sell their homes. In fact, the market has taken a huge knock off from falling house prices. Real estate agents and property experts are urging the government to reverse the government's previous tax rebate, which has effectively kept the cost of ownership down since 2000, as well as tax breaks for those who buy their principal residence on their principal land.

One thing that could help ease the pain of this is the introduction of rent controls – which would essentially allow them to keep all property sales below market rate for the duration of the housing bubble.

Rents and Property

The number of houses in Scotland rose in the 10 months to December.

Between October and December, the average annual change was 4.6% compared to 3.3% the previous year and 1.3% in 2011.

However, since the start of 2012 prices and vacancy rates have risen by 9.7%. That means households cannot keep up with inflation, meaning rents are out of reach for many.

Why do developers and builders need to build more

There are too many new houses being built for demand – which is leading to them being underused. This is especially true if demand falls or the price increases. Developers now sell houses at too much price per square foot to build enough to be competitive at a competitive price. Hence the shortage of available homes.

Furthermore, developers will get more for their investment if the average selling price for all of their properties continues to rise – not to mention that they are likely to be able to offer buyers the highest discount rates available.

So the reason for more developers
