"This study is really important because mosquitoes are vectors of many diseases," said David H. Skaggs, who led the study. "They can transmit both Lyme disease and malaria, not to mention the potentially fatal Zika virus. This new information, together with the current knowledge of tick behavior, will help to better map out strategies to minimize tick-borne disease and improve public health."

When it comes to transmitting diseases, mosquitoes carry a variety of pathogens that include yellow fever, chikungunya (pronounced CHEE-konga) and dengue fever. While mosquitoes are able to bite humans even during the day and at dusk, they are more prevalent at dusk and dawn, when people are outside and have less protection from mosquitoes.

Scientists identified the mosquito-breeding sites in four areas where birds collect a variety of plant materials. They found the mosquitoes tended to target plants that look similar, called attractants; they collected these plants from different locations, suggesting different factors likely influence where mosquitoes pick up food.

"These attractants can be from the plants themselves, or it could be other things like pollen, sap, fruit on nearby trees or rotting wood," Skaggs explained. "It could be any of a number of compounds that make these plants attractive to mosquitoes."

To test whether mosquitoes target different kinds of attractants based on their colors, Skaggs and his colleagues used the color-sensing compound diacetyl in conjunction with an ultraviolet light to shine on the mosquitoes to determine their sexual maturity in adulthood.

"What we can do is shine a light on a mosquito and then collect the droppings that it leaves on plants," he explained. "That way we can identify the sex of the mosquito in adulthood, or as soon as the mosquito has hatched from its egg. If it's male, it will just fly off."

Their research also revealed female mosquitoes don't need an ultraviolet light to see their color, and they're attracted to plants with the same color as both female and male mosquitoes. Males are attracted to red plants while females are attracted to yellow (yellow with a red tint).

"This study helps us identify the attractants that provide the most opportunity for the mosquitoes to breed
