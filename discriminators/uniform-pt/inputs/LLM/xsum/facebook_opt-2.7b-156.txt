 a £50,000 mortgage, but would pay a lower rate.

There were strong signs of growth in the building society sector, with new figures from the Bank of England showing that lending within the sector rose by 12%, or £9.7bn, to £38.8bn in the year to March.

The building society's director of mortgages, David Rothery, said: "Although there have been some challenges that we have faced over the last 12 months, we think that lending has largely held up well.

"Given this, we have decided that now is a good time to provide greater choice and greater value to consumers. The change to our mortgage rates will help give more people more choice when looking for their first fix and will help those with current fixed-rate deals to spread the cost more effectively over longer."

The move follows recent moves by other building society mortgage providers, such as First Direct, to review its rates to provide "more scope for rate cuts".

The rate changes follow an announcement that Nationwide Building Society will offer new borrowers a two-year fixed-rate mortgage deal for buyers of new-build homes.

First Direct also this month hiked its standard two-year fixed-rate product to a rate of 2.89% from 2.54% to match the Bank of England base rate of 2.5% after making a series of rate cuts.

However, Lloyds TSB said in March that it will cut its standard variable mortgage range by up to 3.8% from next month.

A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said: "Fixed-rate mortgages are highly competitive, as the Bank of England base rate shows, and borrowers will see no immediate impact on the market."

The building society said lenders will have to disclose any reductions in rates to customers before they take effect in July.

The new 60-year-old mortgage limit is the latest boost for the building society sector, which is seeing strong inflows of new customer accounts.
