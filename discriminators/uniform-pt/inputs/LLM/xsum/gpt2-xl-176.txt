SEs at grade C than the national average in 2010.

On average, 10% of all pupils achieve five good GCSEs at grade C in the south, compared with 7% nationally. Of these, four-fifths achieved five at grade C for English, maths, science and geography, while seven-quarters did so in reading.

A spokesperson for Birmingham City council said the "challenge" of tackling child poverty was being highlighted in the results and "remains one of the council's greatest challenges."

They added that since 2010, the council had spent Â£6m in targeted initiatives to improve the quality of young people's academic results, including a focus on the most deprived areas and initiatives into children's leisure and community activities.

While Birmingham has a relatively high proportion of pupils at school entry who struggle with reading or maths, it also boasts a high concentration of pupils gaining good GCSEs at grade C.

A number of factors have been pointed to as being behind this, including low-key teaching and an emphasis on pupils' social, physical and cognitive development.

This contrasts with northern cities such as Leeds, which had a disproportionately high number of people failing the 5th grade at age 16, as well as pupils who went on to achieve some grades at A-levels.

Overall, the number of pupils in the south achieving five decent grades at grade C was three and half per cent higher than the national average in 2013, according to the figures

But, with recent increases in pupil numbers and the recent recession adding extra pressure to schools across the region, Brent's education department is
