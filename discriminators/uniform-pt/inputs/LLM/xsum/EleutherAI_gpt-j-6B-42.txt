 maintaining it's "distinctiveness" too.

The artwork now hangs in a local gallery in San Francisco.

"We were going to do a lot to make it look like the real thing," said Joe Miecznikowski, creator of the technology that helped to create Rembrandt's work.

"The work could have been done on [digital] video display, we could have done an oil painting on wood, but we wanted something that you could look at and think, 'Wow, that's a real Rembrandt.'"

So the art experts turned to the technology that has revolutionised the music world and video gaming.

"You start with a base layer, and then on top of it is the subject's hair, with highlights.

"It was a lot of trial-and-error stuff, like, 'How does this subject interact with the light?'"

"It's Rembrandt at a much higher resolution. He'd be excited by it," he said.

"He was a real experiment
