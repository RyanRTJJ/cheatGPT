y the Care Inspectorate who expressed concerns about safety, leadership and staffing.

Aberdeen City Council records revealed that Kingsmead Home provided care for 52 people, some of whom had complex needs or were living with dementia. 

A Report of Investigation by the Care Inspectorate found that Kingsmead Home had a catalogue of failings including; delayed notifications to them about incidents, failure to prevent and assess risks properly, poor systems to ensure staff were adequately trained and incompetent staffing levels.

Despite this, the Care Inspectorate stated that action had been taken to address the majority of previous concerns they raised. Resolution of remaining actions had taken longer than anticipated, however the service is now rated 'good' overall.

Mrs Gray's daughter, Jane Smith, expressed her concerns regarding the quality of care her mother received at Kingsmead in the months leading up to her death. She said that her mother's health had slightly improved while at the home, however her condition deteriorated when she was moved home and subsequently passed away. 

Mrs Smith paid tribute to the hard-working staff at Kingsmead, saying that they had gone the extra mile to make her mother comfortable in the time she was there, and she is glad that the management has taken note of the reports and is working to make improvements.

The Care Quality Commission is continuing to monitor the home and is expecting it to continue to make improvements.
