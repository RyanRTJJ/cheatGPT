 from the people who are suffering the most. As the majority of people coming from Afghanistan find, it is difficult to access the outside world. The vast majority of journalists we speak to report on a 'bottom line' (the most profitable way to make money) rather than in support of the plight of individuals or families.

"The problem is that there is no reliable access to victims, families, carers etc."

This report goes further to look at what happens after a person has been released from hospital.

"For those of the people who have been released from hospital, they often find it very difficult to return home and some become severely depressed – this is because of their loss of liberty and freedom to move, to be in and out of family, to be out and about. Also their family members often experience a range of emotions, from fear and disbelief to a sense of loss."

According to NHS Choices, a hospital stays cost NHS England around £13,000 per person with a four-person ward costing £22,000 – this is less than 2% of the average monthly wage.

But if you don't have money, there are charities that help the family with housing and transport. Many have also helped children recover and have found life has improved.

One charity is the Hope Home - www.hopehome.org.uk - which provides counselling, education and support for those who have been released from hospital.

However, you can also help those affected by this article. If you feel you were treated unfairly, would you be willing to help others?
