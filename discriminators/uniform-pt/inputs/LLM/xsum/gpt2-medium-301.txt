", but they had no means to pay the $20 fee.

As for Boudreau, he said he wanted to do well for a job he loved and a cause he believed deeply.

"I really can't get out of bed in the morning. I can't go out on trips anymore," the 26-year-old resident of the townhouse complex said on CBC Toronto's On the Hunt. "I can't go on all those road trips."
