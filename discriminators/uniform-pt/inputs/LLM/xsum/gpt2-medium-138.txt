This comes after another controversial funding deal between Edinburgh's police and councils, which saw them agree a "cave-in" deal for local authority funding.

The "cave" agreement saw a 12-month transitional settlement between the Edinburgh District police and councils that took place when the new Police and Crime Commissioners were elected on 13 September, 2015. That agreement ended five years of austerity cuts with the deal allowing police to carry out a range of new operational measures, such as a more visible presence in the streets, faster training of officers, new technology and much more.

"The agreement with our policing partners has seen important contributions to reduce crime across Scotland for some time," said Scottish Police Scotland's Chief Constable Stuart Cundy.

"This agreement has helped to reduce criminal incidents in Glasgow city centre during 2013 but it is not perfect. Our officers are committed to keeping the community safe, and will carry out any operations needed to achieve that.

"It is important to recognise and acknowledge that there will be some areas of Glasgow that may fall outside of the agreement but there would still be many resources that could be used.

"Our officers will focus not only on the areas where they are focused but also to ensure we have a good and effective police force that is able to respond best in any emergency."
