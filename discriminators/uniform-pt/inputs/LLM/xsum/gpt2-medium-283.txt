"It is extremely difficult to estimate the probable level of impact of this magnitude without remote sensing, based on radar data, as well as sonar observations off the Indian Ocean," a source familiar with the investigation told the South China Morning Post.

In April, US navy divers found two bodies off Reunion, with the bodies of one British citizen and one Indian National having been pulled from the sea floor. The families of the bodies said they were
