 for them to receive more training - particularly from women.

In the first three years of study, some 40% of students drop out. Around 20% leave without having completed the full course, as opposed to some 15% who don’t go in the first year.

Some of those who graduate to become AMs cite sexism as key reason for leaving the course - the male students, having completed a degree themselves, are perceived as the experts and can impose their views on female students.

“Most women can identify a situation where a male has influenced her, but more often than not it’s a female who has influenced a male,” Dr Rana said.

She explained that most AMs felt that a male teacher is the one in charge of the class, although there are exceptions.

“What’s great about training men is that you get a lot of new and fresh perspectives to take with you when you get out,” she said.

Mr Lall, who is also completing a BA in English, said that it made sense for the institution to allow more male students, since he believes men are better able to take in different views.

“I thought that it was a natural move,” he said.

“There are plenty of women around the world who are interested in literature, or journalism. I thought it would be the best way of bringing in a new perspective to the classes - a fresh perspective - and being able to relate them to the students.”

“It has not been received (as a woman’s issue) - it has been more of a case that it does not have the representation,” he said.

According to the survey, of the total respondents who were interested in being AMs, around 25% were women.

However, the commission’s report into the institution’s working environment has raised concerns over the gender pay gap.

Despite being a single-sex institution, most staff of the Assembly Commission are women, and they often work side-by-side
