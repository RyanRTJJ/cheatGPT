 who also took the 10,000m and 5,000m gold medals in Glasgow earlier this Sunday.

McColgan ran with Ayana for almost the entire event, the pair running stride for stride from the gun. The Briton was running with her head tilted back around 90 degrees, the angle from which she is generally prone to race her 10,000m best.

It made for a strange sight, as Ayana ran so easily, her stride so fluid, her speed so effortless, whereas Colgan, who has been a more consistent runner over middle and longer distances in recent years, seemed to lack her strength.

McColgan's body language didn't bear this out, however. She sat on the ground, arms folded, head tilted, looking back out of the corner of one eye as Ayana ran her through the early parts of the race. Colgan looked back, at the other and back again at the track.

"It's been an enjoyable couple of days," said Colgan, who won the 1500m on Saturday. "It's been a bit of a weird weekend, I've been having some fun, even though the racing's been tough."

McColgan had been left off the Great Britain 5000m team that travelled to Moscow last Tuesday - a trip she said she'd always wanted to take - and didn't feel she could risk it having felt so poorly recently in training and, on top of that, being married to an Englishman with a son living in Italy.

At the time she wasn't convinced there might be a place for her on a British squad.

"You want to be there and I had that," she said. "But I was like, it's quite tough coming to London for a training camp - it's not ideal."

McColgan now seems convinced, however, the time is right, in fact the best time to return at all.

She's due to compete in the European 5000m championships in Zurich next month, finishing training in the UK on Tuesday, with the expectation that she will be in London on Friday for an 800m in which she will be aiming for a place in the Olympic Games.
