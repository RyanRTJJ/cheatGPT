Campaigners from the Stop The War Coalition and the Stop The War Coalition (UK) are calling for public trials for those who ordered the murder of five British soldiers in Northern Ireland.

The Stop the War Coalition called upon the courts to ensure that those responsible for the soldiers' murders were held to account. However it said that the government was not planning to hold a trial.

Instead, the government planned to conduct a full trial at Leeds High Court during 29-29 July next year, a month after the 20th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, in which 10 unarmed Civil Rights protesters were shot dead in Londonderry.

"This is not acceptable to justice campaigners and those whose lives were affected. The Coalition is campaigning for a public inquiry with the aim of getting to the truth."

The Coalition added that despite an overwhelming majority of MPs voting in favour of public trials this year, "it is now clear the government will not act until after next year's election".

"In the interests of justice and the reputation of our soldiers it is right that this issue be properly resolved in public."

The group also pointed out that a public inquiry was already pending into the issue and that the government was bound by legislation to carry out a public inquiry into civilian killings in Northern Ireland where the main offender is known to have acted alone.

In a statement, the Defence Committee said: "The Department of Defence does not believe such a public inquiry is required for this matter since a full, public trial will be convened by the Courts."

"As there is no intention to allow a public trial,
