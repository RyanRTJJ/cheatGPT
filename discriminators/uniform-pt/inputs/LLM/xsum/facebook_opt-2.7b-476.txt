 more than three years.

“We will not have any interest rate hike from us this year,” Draghi said. He added that the outlook for inflation in Europe was better than that of the U.S. and other major economies.

The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.1 percent annual rate from July through September, and unemployment fell. But in December, the Federal Reserve decided not to raise interest rates from the historically low levels, citing slower global growth as a reason and saying that it was in no hurry to end its asset purchases.

The U.S. unemployment rate actually fell to 5.1 percent in December, compared with 5 percent the month before.

In December alone, the European Central Bank said it had bought the equivalent of 456 billion euros ($561.2 billion) of bonds to try to revive the recession-weary eurozone economy. In October, ECB President Mario Draghi said the bank would buy 1 trillion euros (about 1.2 trillion U.S.).

Draghi stressed the importance of the ECB’s bond purchase program.

“Because of the purchases, our financing conditions remain very favourable,” Draghi said. “And with these favourable financing conditions, interest rates are continuing to come down, while at the same time inflation is expected to rise gradually.”

Many market players anticipate that the ECB may have to increase its asset purchases to stop the rise in inflation. This would likely send its currency lower.

Draghi again said that he was pleased with low interest rates in the euro area, but said the lower prices could not become permanent because many of his members — including Germany, a leader of the currency bloc — argued persistently against higher prices.

Draghi said member countries that opposed higher rates included Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Malta, Ireland, Finland, Luxembourg, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden, Switzerland and Finland.

Earlier in the week, Draghi said that his decision on more bond purchases was not a commitment to keep buying them at the volume approved
