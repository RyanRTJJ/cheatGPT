 the Kaaba, and the crowd of pilgrims did not take notice of this. But I was praying that Allah should save me and I would never forget this prayer.

So when the news spread around the camp that a foreigner was dead, everyone went in the direction of the victim. I stood back to the road side which would lead to the campsite. Suddenly people shouted "The foreigner is dead, the murderer has been caught." It took some minutes until I made the turn on that side. I saw an old woman holding out her hand. She said in Hausa to the policemen "It is that woman who killed the foreigner."

When it comes to this woman everyone knows who she is. A few days after the incident, she has been in prison since 7.00 am when her son came to see me. She said “I saw the foreigner killed right on the spot. How could I have resisted this mad man?"

The old woman's story is the same as the ones from the other families.

Now I feel like I know all the families of the victims. Most of them are either traders or people who are living and working in Saudi Arabia, some are Saudis, others are foreigners. One man was telling that his sister sent him some money to visit his mother; on return he was not allowed to see his mother and they gave him a piece of paper in the hospital where they brought his body. He wanted to check on the letter because he wanted to know where his mother was.

Some families from Jeddah came, they were afraid he would be buried without having a proper last Islamic prayer, that is why they decided to dig his body up out of the ground in the middle of the Mina to say his prayer.

I have never been to Mina in my life; I
