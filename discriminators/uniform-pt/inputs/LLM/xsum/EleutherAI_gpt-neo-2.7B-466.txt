 community centre with a library, swimming pool, community hall, offices, a health center and an indoor sporting facility, according to city documents.

Under the first phase, more than 2,000 new homes will also be built.

In his report to cabinet on Wednesday, O'Dowd said he didn't think it would be prudent to hold talks with the land owner to sell the land now and he called the land acquisition proposal "a very attractive proposal".

"We would like the land to go ahead as soon as possible," he said.

The project will cost nearly $2 million and is expected to be ready for occupation in 2015.

The new centre will replace a current facility at the site, which has become a community center, and will feature a new library, pool, gym, community hall and other facilities.

O'Dowd said the community centre will be a "very active" community facility.

"The goal is to make it open every day of the week, every weekend of the entire year. You will find people out and about doing all kinds of things in this facility."

Coun. Jim Llegerman said that if a land deal were to be signed for sale now for the site, he would be happy to have the community centre in its current location, but it would be hard to sell a piece of property that has been used solely by a community centre.

"I think it's unfortunate that people have been in favour of this site and they're seeing it as an addition to the Town Hall, not a community centre," Llegerman said.

Llegerman added that in the time he has been in government, he hasn't seen the need to do much with community centres, because of the high cost and lack of funding.

NDP MLA for the area Tom Browder had said earlier this week that there were "some things" that would have to happen before a land deal was signed for the land.

Browder said, "So far no one has stepped forward to do any significant development on this site and we are going to get a few more bids on this land."

The NDP MLA was responding to comments made by Couns. Michael
