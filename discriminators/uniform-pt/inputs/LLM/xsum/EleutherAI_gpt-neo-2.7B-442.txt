 over the counter.

According to law, tattoo images should have a “significant artistic intent” and use “non-obtrusive” colors and symbols that are not meant for commercial use such as blood, gore, human nudity.

“In some ways these artworks are not quite what we would consider to be illegal, but that doesn’t mean that it’s entirely acceptable,” said Ms. Chirac.

“This is a clear area for improvement and regulation. And the only way to fix that is to regulate this activity.”

The Ministry of Labour has confirmed that nine of the 10 tattoo artists had been served with a letter of violation before they were found, and the remaining was still under investigation. The ministry would not say when the investigation was initiated.

Some people said they had previously sought a licence for their tattoo or would start the process again if the ban was lifted.

But other people were angered.

“The ban only made things worse. At what point do you realize it’s a huge financial drain to your community?” asked Paul Zibakally.

Others said they were still getting tattoos, and some say they did their best as parents to try to prevent their children from being involved.
