"We're currently using our drones in Afghanistan and are going to begin them in Afghanistan to help identify and mark enemy positions, build the base and help with intelligence collection," said Bill Harrigan, director of strategic planning for the Army's Rapid Equipping Force. "If you look at the technology that exists today, the idea that you could have a self-carryable aircraft on an unmanned system to fly over areas where friendly or enemy troops are located to deliver a payload to where they're located is exciting and is a potential capability for us."

The service's technology development group is charged with identifying and testing technologies that could contribute to a broader strategy or operational effect. The agency is tasked with developing and procuring equipment and weapons systems to enhance the force and operations that improve military effectiveness.

"I don't see any technology that we're conducting currently that is new but there certainly will be some new technology being developed," Harrigan said.

In the past two years the Army has begun test flights of a wide array of new technologies, which were developed out of existing R&D. Among the systems under development: the first 3D-printed missile launcher, a handheld, compact, multi-spectrum radar and a new class of aircraft for special operations forces that will allow them to operate from remote locations.

"The Army has been very deliberate in selecting the type of technology that they're conducting for testing and evaluations," said Tom Eason, director of the Center on National Security at George Washington University. "They're really trying to identify what the best ones might be and the best use cases. A lot of the current technologies that are in development for the Army are being developed primarily for the military industrial complexes."

The Pentagon is eager to find out how autonomous drones can enhance operations.
