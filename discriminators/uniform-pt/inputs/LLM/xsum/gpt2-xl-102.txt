 effects to a few gulls.

A similar accident was reported at the Port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, in March 2007, when a ship's tank was hit by one of the large ice chunks from the Arctic.

In a statement the National Energy Board of Alberta said: "The N.E.B. will undertake a significant review of safety in oil and natural gas ship operations in the Arctic, particularly with respect to the protection of migratory birds and the habitat in and around the Arctic, as it relates to the N.E.B.'s ability and desire to conduct operations in the region."

On a similar note and based on the same incident, the Alberta Federation of Labour released a letter to the government of Alberta's Minister of Labor, Ron Kruger, outlining how many jobs oil and gas facilities on the north side of the border could create, and how they would help the province.

"One of the most expensive and least reliable ways to expand production in the oil sands region is through new tankers passing through Canadian marine terminals and on to international markets," the letter says.

"The risk of collision with oil or gas pipelines carries severe financial consequences. In the event of an oil tanker grounding or accident in the area, oil sands facilities and pipelines would have to be shut down for a sufficient time to minimize the risk of any potential spill."

The Canadian government recently announced that it will spend C$2.5 billion ($1.5 billion) on major energy projects like the Northern Gateway pipeline to the Pacific and the Northern Gateway Pipeline to the Atlantic â€” pipelines that would increase Alberta's production to 1.2 million barrels per day.

The industry, meanwhile, supports more oil shipments to Asia, arguing that the Asian market for energy goods is growing at a much faster rate than the rest of the world, and that the industry is making strong inroads by developing a new technology that has the potential to safely produce large volumes of crude from tight oil deposits in the Alberta Bakken and other tight-oil plays.

While the northern oil and gas industry says the risk to birds as well as oil spills is minimal and oil spills have become so
