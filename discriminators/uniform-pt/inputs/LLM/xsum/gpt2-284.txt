The new code has been adopted by four other states.

And the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it has received an average of 17 per cent of calls out of the 50 states.

"There are no new, no serious safety problems," said Eric Erskine, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief. "We continue to work with our partners and stakeholders to find ways to reduce the number of deaths."

But some of those who have asked for more safety precautions are disappointed.

For example, they say bicyclists are much less likely to be followed if they're not facing an approaching traffic camera but are at risk.

And Dr James A. Neely, who leads a group of cyclists in New York City's downtown who are using bicycles for their daily walk, says he is more concerned with how safety measures are carried out in intersections.

"There are an incredibly small number of people that make the most sense of this," he said.

• This story was amended on 2:29 p.m. to clarify a statement provided by Neely that cycling is a different game from driving. It is only a sport, not an illegal activity, and, as with a vehicle, if you leave the roadway in traffic, if you have a red light and have no brakes, then traffic traffic becomes safer. The statement was corrected on Saturday. All drivers driving traffic-free on footways, bike lanes or street corners should be careful they don't get in front of a police officer.

More than 40,000 people from about 35 states, with 25,000 in New York City, have posted comments on Facebook expressing their support for Highway 101 and Highway 92.

Motorists: Don't walk in front of traffic cameras. Get out your wetsuit. — Mary Louise Dvorak (@MaryLouiseDvorak) January 29, 2013

Do they see a traffic warning? Is a bike lane a green light? — Robert Williams (@BobWilliams) January 29, 2013

It's a lot more serious, but I'd expect a lot less than 20 fatalities. I would put it at 35.3 and 35.2. — Kevin Alesma (@keithalesma) January 29, 2013
