seeking cowboys ride around in cowboy gear while a host of other stunts were completed.

The event in 2010 was met with a mixed reception from some locals, and after more than a year of deliberation over how best to commemorate the event, the decision was made to postpone it.

As many as 700 people have now signed a petition against the event, which was expected to be held on November 18 this year after the organisers submitted proposals last month.

Last year's event was held three days later, on Friday, November 15. More than 15,000 people visited the event, while hundreds more took part in a ride on the replica of a Wild West gunboat and rodeo competition that took place on Sunday, November 18.

The rebel cheese rollers group is planning a second event on March 28.

A spokesman for the organisers of the event did not immediately respond to a request for comment this week.
