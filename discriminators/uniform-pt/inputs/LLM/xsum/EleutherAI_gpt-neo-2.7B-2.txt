 from the patients or family members and friends who know them inside out.

So take care of your friends who have children or grandchildren, and they will take care of you. The first people my father took care of and helped were when he was in hospital for a serious illness.

When my wife received a call at 10 30 pm on Sunday night from her brother who was concerned about his health in hospital, he called to tell her that he was “feeling fine.” When I received a call at around 12 30 am that his condition had worsened and he was in danger, I felt compelled to rush him to the hospital immediately.

While I’m obviously not his doctor, I feel blessed to have my father take care of him because that’s what we did. We took care of him for his entire hospital stay.

The nurses at the hospital were also great. Dr. Paul’s nursing team took some really nice care of us – from making us comfortable to taking care of our needs. I was able to enjoy a glass of wine, a cheeseburger, and some chicken (not too much because I was only at home for about 40 hours; most of that time spent in ICU) and the nurses were wonderful to get me through the night.

One of the most helpful things the nurses did was to come up with a formula to give during an extubation when we were getting our breath back. It took them a little while to figure that out, but it was a nice way to ensure that we had some calories in our bodies so that we were comfortable enough to go home.

Dr. Bill’s staff was also great. At the beginning of every shift he would come into the ICU to speak to us and make sure that we were all comfortable. Once we were cleared for discharge, I was able to visit his office for the week to thank him as well.

When the first thing I noticed was Dr. Paul’s and Dr. Bill’s names in the paper, I immediately knew that I wanted to get in contact with them. They were both terrific, and I hope that
