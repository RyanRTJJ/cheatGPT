. Demonstrators have burned down the parliament building and a police station.

The current assembly has been dissolved after a no-confidence vote.

"I appeal to all the legislators to come back with a united stance and vote against this government and this illegitimate and unconstitutional assembly," he said. "I request them to use their political wisdom and to make the right decision and to vote against this illegitimate, unconstitutional assembly."

The speaker repeated calls for talks and said that only dialogue can help heal the rift between the state and the opposition-led coalition.

"This government is like a big ship that has become submerged in the sea. We need to sail with it, but we need to sail with us as well," he said. "If we keep arguing, we are dead."

The speaker said he was confident the constitutional charter bill could be passed in the assembly as soon as possible, and added the people demanded the abolition of the assembly, but in their minds they are asking for only the dissolution of the current body.

"This body is not dissolved and this body is an instrument for dialogue so I appeal to my fellow legislators not to destroy the state," he said. "The people have been demanding the abolition of the assembly for over two months, so I urge them to reconsider, but we can live only once democracy is restored."

The speaker said a new constitution was needed to restore trust among the people, adding that the people have not been heard.

"We have had 15 months of chaos and unrest. The people have called for dialogue; they have made protests, even killed people. The state has not listened to their demands and this has led to them taking to the streets," he said.

"I appeal to my fellow legislators not to destroy the constitution, not to destroy the state. We may destroy the state or create chaos in the state but to destroy the constitution is just an error
