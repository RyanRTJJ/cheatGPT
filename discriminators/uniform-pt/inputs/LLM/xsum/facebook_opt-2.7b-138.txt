 to anyone involved in an incident of rape or any sexual offence.

Chief Constable Euan Slater said: “I’d like to thank all those who have supported us so far in our efforts to raise awareness of rape, sexual violence and its serious consequences. The money we raise will have an invaluable impact on improving our understanding of this issue in Scotland.”

The campaign launched yesterday is the first of two planned. The campaign will raise awareness of the impact of rape and sexual violence on victims, survivors and their families.

It will also help the government understand the true scale of the problem.

Mr Slater said that Scotland’s rape rate was the second-highest in the UK.

He added: “The problem has reached catastrophic proportions in Orkney and Shetland, and the support we are getting from Rape Crisis Scotland is vital.

“We now have to ensure it is widely understood and discussed. We want to encourage everyone to talk about it, whether at a party, in an internet chat group or, best of all, in the company of someone they trust. And to do that we are launching this campaign.”

David Maclean, director of training and services at Rape Crisis Scotland, said the funding would provide vital service for those needing it in the islands.

He said: “Rape Crisis Scotland has welcomed the offer of funding from Scotland’s Chief Constable Euan Slater and officers at Police Scotland. This money will make a vital difference to the services we provide in Orkney and Shetland, and will ensure that everyone – those who experience, report, support or care for a survivor of rape and sexual assault – has access to appropriate and appropriate treatment and support services.

“We welcome funding from this source and hope that it will help people in Orkney and Shetland who would also benefit from this opportunity.”
