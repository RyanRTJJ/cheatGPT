 said it would allow the visitor to "interact with his or her imagined city, to enter a fantasy scenario, or make use of a narrative device."

It will show on a large cinema screen, or be shown through virtual reality software.

But the art will still be the work of Banksy, as he has been on the run since last month when two of his pieces were sold at Sotheby's New York.

The identity of who painted the two pieces remains a mystery, though the owner of the other piece, an early spray which read "Dogs ate my art", has revealed that they could be him.

Both of the paintings, which were discovered in a house in East London, can be seen at Tate Modern - along with 13 other pieces from his huge body of work.

They are the first two of many shows put together by the artist, who has previously shown his art at the Old Trafford Cricket Ground.

"The new city in this installation is an imaginary one, and yet it is at the same time recognisable," said Tate director Nicholas Serota, who will travel to New York to show the city itself with the art.

"It is a unique visual experience for Tate Modern visitors to enter the world of Banksy."

The two major exhibitions have been funded in part by a philanthropist, John Kingman, who described them as the "start of an exciting new collaboration".
