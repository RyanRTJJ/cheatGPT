The disaster triggered a fire scare at a nuclear plant near Fukushima, Japan, when hydrogen sulphide gas was released. Two Japanese nuclear plants were restarted on Monday because of the disaster.

Authorities have already decided to raise the alarm if more hydrogen sulphide is released. A radiation dose of more than 10 millisieverts is considered acute. But authorities said it was unlikely that the level of radiation could affect anyone beyond the immediate area.

The scale of the disaster has been fuelled by a sudden rise in the number of fires that spread into the ocean after the gas was released. Thousands of people are feared to have been affected.

The nuclear disaster was widely seen as the most severe incident of its kind since the Chernobyl nuclear disaster near the Ukrainian border in 1986, in which some 26,000 people were killed.

The nuclear disaster started on the same day last month when a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami struck northeast Japan, sparking fierce aftershocks.

The quake is expected to trigger major earthquake-tsunami waves that could kill around 10,000 people.

More than 300 people in northern Japan have died since last March in one of the world's deadliest disasters when a nuclear power plant was damaged by the 8.9-magnitude quake and tsunami.

Japan is the world's biggest oil importer and nuclear power accounts for about one-eighth of the energy demand.

Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tokyo Power, Tokyo Electric Power Co) began shutting down its nuclear reactors this week as part of preparations for the disaster.

Tokyo Power Co is the third largest nuclear power company in the world and operates four nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi complex, a joint venture with the Kyushu Electric Power Co and the Chugoku Electric Power Co.

The Japanese nuclear regulator, the Nuclear Safety Commission, announced on Saturday (14 May) that one of the three damaged nuclear reactors at the complex showed some
