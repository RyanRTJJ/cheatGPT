 long hours to increase their fertility -- even if they don't feel they can lose weight and still do the job.

Shift work has been linked to obesity, depression, hypertension, kidney problems, high blood pressure and even obesity and Alzheimer's disease. Yet it was not a factor when a number of Canadian and U.K. studies looked at shifts in their menopausal patients, some of whom are also at risk for weight gain and have low blood clotting factors.

In a study published in June in The New England Journal of Medicine, University of Toronto researchers compared the health of 12,000 Canadian women who worked long hours, and those who didn't, in different occupations.

They didn't detect a statistically significant difference in weight gain, but the women who worked three days a week had an increased prevalence of Type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis and hip fractures in three decades. The researchers also studied 25,000 Canadian women before they went to the hospital between 2001 and 2009, and again six months later, to determine whether long hours contribute to the poor health of their wives.

There is a body of evidence suggesting that working in a demanding job can damage health, particularly during the early stages of a woman's pregnancy. But shift work and workaholicism are among the "occupational hazards" (including the use of drugs, smoking, alcohol and illicit drug use) that contribute the most to the decline in the labour force participation rate, which has shrunk by more than a third since the beginning of the 21st century.

There was also a higher incidence of hypertension among women with high maternal work hours, compared with women with low work hours. But the higher risk would not necessarily protect women against cardiovascular disease. The relationship was stronger among women and children who were more likely to have at least some parental care responsibilities, and a more active lifestyle.

For decades, the assumption within the corporate world has been based on the notion that working long hours means increased productivity. While some long-time executives have taken that on board, many are now questioning whether such the theory is valid.

The shift-work study found that high-risk women are at greater risk than are low-risk
