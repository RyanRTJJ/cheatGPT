ncluding Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs), police workforce numbers across England and Wales fell by 21,708 (-14%) over that same period. When Fire and Rescue Service personnel are included, a further 4,255 (-13%) employees have been lost.

These figures reflect the fact that austerity has had a significant impact on police forces in England and Wales, with police budgets being reduced by 25% between central government grants to local police forces. This has meant that police officers in England and Wales are now seven hundred fewer than in 2010, with the biggest cuts being seen in the Metropolitan Police, West Midlands Police, and Greater Manchester Police.

Despite the cuts, the number of police officers employed in England and Wales has remained fairly consistent, with the decrease in large part due to the sharp decrease in the number of PCSOs – whose numbers have almost halved since 2010 – and civilian staff. However, forces are increasingly using technology and digital resources to assist in police work, with some forces now using ‘predictive policing’ technologies to try and anticipate crimes before they’re committed.

Overall, the main impact of austerity on policing in England and Wales has been the reduction in the number of personnel available to front-line services. As such, it is likely that the decrease in police officers over the same period will have had a notable impact on the response times of forces, and their ability to foresee and prevent criminal activity.
