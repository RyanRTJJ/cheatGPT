 can fulfil its mission of bringing the Welsh experience to life.

The report recommends a review of the funding structures for S4C and the Broadcasting Corporation of Wales (BBC Cymru Wales) to ensure they are equally resourced. It also called for better collaboration between the two broadcasters, and for independent production companies, to meet audience needs.

Recommendations in the report include the setting up of a Creative Wales Fund to support the development of new Welsh language content, and money to be set aside to increase S4C's input of indigenous Welsh language content.

The report also said that S4C should be given a greater influence in European Union decision making to ensure the Welsh language is taken into account.

In addition, the report said the Welsh Government should review the current governance and management of S4C to ensure it remains accountable to the people of Wales.
