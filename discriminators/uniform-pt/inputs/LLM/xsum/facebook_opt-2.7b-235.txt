 the Battle of Gallipoli.

The initiative aims to put a face to World War One and remember the loss of those fighting in battle in 1915.

Australians were invited to share memories of ancestors who lost their lives serving abroad during the First World War.

The stories will be collected into a digital anthology for people to read and re-read, telling the stories of Australians affected by the horrific conflict.

The Battle of Gallipoli was the bloodiest in the history of the British Army, with 11,000 Australians and New Zealanders dying in five weeks.

More than 23,000 men from Australia and New Zealand died in the Gallipoli campaign, which saw the Allies land in the Turkish territory of Anzac Cove on April 25 1915.

The story of Australia's involvement in the Gallipoli campaign will be the second to enter the compilation on Remembrance Day.

Tasmanian MP Jacqui Lambie will be one of the judges to select winners and finalists.

Australia's most war-torn state, South Australia, will have the honour of hosting the final day of the memorial.

The final day is a national commemoration that involves many Australian communities.

This year, veterans will attend the final day events at The Parade of Remembrance in The Sydney Opera House, including those from the Australian and New Zealand Army Forces (ANZAC) as well as service members and their families.

More than 70,000 people are expected to line the streets for the event in the heart of Sydney.

There was no formal ceremony in Sydney on Friday to mark the beginning of the Gallipoli commemorations, but local Aboriginal groups held events.

Earlier this week, Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott revealed that he wanted the nation to "put Gallipoli beyond the bounds of history" with "no apology or tears" with his new initiative.
