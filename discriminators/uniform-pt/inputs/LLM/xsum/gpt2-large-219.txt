 voluntary redundancies were already being considered, and the council says the government had a part in the decision to get out of the business.

"As noted earlier, the council has been forced to make other savings, such as through the closure of over 1,000 primary schools and the reduction of police and council services," he said. "These were in addition to the £30m savings that remain to be achieved under the proposed fiscal framework."
