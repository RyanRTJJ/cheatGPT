Mr Buffett said he took an even bigger deduction during his 2008 presidential run.

"He took a huge deduction, and that's why that person is so dishonest," Mr Buffett said.

Mr Buffett was referring to President Barack Obama's $7.5 billion federal salary package and $3.2 billion for his company Berkshire Hathaway Trust that has raised $26m in capital and invested $1.8bn.

The businessman's wife, Jill, said he used his charitable giving to help his family. "I can't speak for myself, but I don't know that it would be hard for them," he said.

In the two years in which he earned this much cash, Mr Buffett was paying $1.4bn in federal income taxes, according to his tax return available on the website of his company Berkshire Hathaway.

The couple, who live in Brooklyn, in the South Shore of New York, say they received about $100-million in personal checks from Mr Trump, and his family, in return for helping pay their college tuition.

Last month, according to a copy of the federal tax forms filed with the IRS, they reported receiving a $922,913 check from his trust. The couple pay about $25,000 a month in state transfers to charity but no federal income tax, tax officials say.

One of Trump's campaign aides, Steve Bannon, who founded Breitbart News in 2016, said in a statement early this month that the billionaire had not been contacted about his tax returns.

The couple have raised more than $4bn in the first 36 months of the year, which is higher than any presidential candidate for at least 20 years. Trump's tax filings were widely discussed by news organizations.

It was not clear when the billionaire became a presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
