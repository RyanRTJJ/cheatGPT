The BBC's Chris Morris says it was a grim prospect and the storm was expected to hit hard south of Paris at night.

Our correspondent says in some areas parts of central and northern France faced water up to six feet and rivers which sometimes reached 14m (39ft) high.

Weather officials from the French coast are due to leave the coast on Monday, but there is a risk of additional flooding, he adds.

French President Francois Hollande says an official visit to Italy is also cancelled because of the storms that broke out across southern Italy early on Monday.

He has said there is more than enough warning and rescue equipment in place.
