 tested.

Around 35 million people are thought to live with long-term blood sugar issues, or risk diabetes. According to the charity, that is up to nine million more people than previously thought.

Health minister Lord Bethell said there was an "urgent need" to get to grips with the health problems.

But he added: "While there's good evidence that making small changes can make a big difference, it's important that we have a long-term strategy."

The figures were published as Diabetes UK said more people need to be taught healthy eating, which has been shown to reduce the risks of developing the condition.

Diabetes UK's head of charity, Louise Scovell, said: "Our national diabetes prevention campaign, Let's Get Tested, aims to get millions more people tested by 2012.

"But to do that, we need to get this message out there about what a diabetes test can do for you.

"Even if you think you've never done anything wrong in the past when it comes to how you eat, the message remains: you could get blood pressure problems, kidney complications and even type two diabetes, all due to eating too much sugar.

"That's why we support the recommendations in the Eat Well, Stay Well guideline."

Diabetes UK also pointed out the government has said it will fund a million more tests over the next three years.

It called for those who think they are at risk, or have problems, but are not diagnosed, to be taken seriously by doctors and the NHS.

"Millions of people are still being ignored and their symptoms go un-diagnosed, and that's why we want to see more focus on prevention, both in schools and the workplace," its chief executive, Professor Sally Davies said.

Hospitals are being asked to do more to encourage healthy eating among patients diagnosed with a blood sugar condition, or suspected of having diabetes, according to the National Institute for Health andCare Excellence.

The NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: "This is a landmark move from the Department of Health, which underlines the critical role of the NHS in the battle against the country's huge health inequalities."
