" of the user names and passwords for online service Google Plus and some Twitter data.

He claimed in a YouTube video uploaded this week that: "It’s my personal database of what I have gathered over years.

"It’s like a real database if you’ve ever been in any databases before but this data, most of this data is mine and it’s not all over the interwebs anymore.

"When I say data, data means users and passwords and their user names and dates of birth. There is some Twitter information in there and a fair bit of Google Plus information.

“So, it’s not even a whole lot of that but that was the data I was looking for that it was the most valuable. “When you realise it’s all of Google Plus it’s really big if you think about it. It’s big.

“It’s thousands of users and it’s not public at all in any of the sites that are involved. So, people have to connect to it, they’ve to have the right code to log in to that and they’ve to connect to Google Plus to do that. So, it’s basically if you think about it, it wasn’t just that one database of information, but it was five databases, to be honest.

“You have to think about that and why anybody would want to trade it or anything. I don’t know and I don’t get any money from it or none of it.

“But it’s not like I went into the interwebs and searched for people who have a lot of Facebook pages or something.”

He added that "some users might be able to check it out anyway" and the offer would soon be closed.
