The bout took a beating for WBO and IBF welterweight leader Johny Hendricks. In a victory over undefeated champ John Stockton in a 10-round split-decision victory Saturday at Madison Square Garden, Hendricks, 35, had claimed a title shot at #3 on ESPN's "Sports Illustrated Sports" for the third straight month, surpassing a unanimous decision for "The Ultimate Fighter 13" at the main card in January.

Rousimar Palhares (29-4-1) won with two submissions in the final eight rounds and will face Nate Diaz (31-6-0) in the first two rounds of the third fight at Madison Square Garden.

Former featherweight champion Conor McGregor is currently ranked 30th in the world in career wins, while he was eliminated to lose to former champion Michael Bisping in last year's Bellator 155.

"I've been thinking about it and talking to my friend, [WWE veteran] Daniel Carmouche, and obviously as a veteran I can get involved in the community.

"I feel like this fight should get a lot of attention, as I already said it would. I didn't have a huge amount of hype but I felt like my life was on the line in this fight."

Bisping had been undefeated for almost two years after beating the controversial WBA featherweight champion in July 2015. After his stunning knockout loss in September 2015, Bisping fought his first-round knockout at Madison Square Garden to get into the UFC.

"I think there's some pressure and some people are really getting into this and people are coming at this fight on a personal level, but I wanted to prove my level of play," said D-Lightweight and former top-ten heavyweight prospect Anthony Johnson when asked to compare the two.

"I think if you look at recent days, there's probably a lot of pressure on the fans for D-Lightweights in this fight."
