 on her doorstep and is urging fans to give him a home!

Evan Whitehouse's artwork - a bronze sculpture titled The New Born - was unveiled on the steps of New York City's Town Hall in October last year.

The sculpture depicts a mother - dressed in a brown silk robe, holding her newborn - with its powerful composition tackling the 'convoluted ways in which a mother's gender is reinforced by social traditions, such as the ritual of circumcision, which most often takes place before birth.'

Speaking to NewYorker, Whitehouse said, 'The woman depicted in the piece, which is currently out of commission but which I hope to have reinstalled in the near future, is me.

'The painting is intended to be a symbolic gesture, a response to the question: In which order is gender constructed?... I mean, there are many ways in which a man’s body is conditioned by social conditioning. But, to me, the way a woman’s body is constructed is one of the most problematic, and there is so little I can do about that. But, I’m hoping that there will be something I can do about our social institutions that actually do this.'
