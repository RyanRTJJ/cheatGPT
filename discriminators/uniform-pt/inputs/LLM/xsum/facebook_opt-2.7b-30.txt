, Natalie Burdett, said there were clear signs she was still alive.

The teenager's body was discovered in woodland in Great Houghton, Leicestershire, near the home of a friend, Matthew Hogg, 14, and the couple's 14-year-old daughter.

Ms Burdett, 29, said the girl had been playing football with the teenager's other friends the night before. Her body was found in a forest just across the road.

"She was playing with the little girls the night before," she said. "Some fellas came to collect the dog and she got into the scuff with them. She told me she had done the wrong thing but she got away with it."

Leicestershire police are still searching for Mr Hogg and his partner's daughter, who are both being treated for severe head injuries.

Ms Burdett added: "At the police's request, her body was sent for post-mortem to check for wounds such as a broken jaw bone. There was a lot of bruising."

The case has shocked Leicestershire, with more than 1,600 people signing a petition calling for the pair to be punished.

Ms Burdett said they would have a special place in the children's hearts because the little girl had such a big impact on them.

"She was a wonderful girl," she said. "She was my older cousin and she was such a great influence on the kids. She would have been 14 in a matter of weeks."

Friends of the girl left cards at her roadside vigil at Great Houghton last night, saying they were "devastated" by what had happened.

"It brings the whole community together," a man said. "There's been a huge outpouring of anger."

One woman, who identified herself only as Mary, said: "I've known the victim all my life. I've watched her grow up â€“ she's always been kind. She never stood out.
