Samsung is expected to issue another recall later this month if it deems the phones pose a safety risk. A source close to the firm who asked not to be named told The Korea Times that the company is still waiting for details from the company to determine how to react to the Note 7 issues.

On June 27, Samsung recalled 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7s to replace faulty batteries.

The Note 7 is Samsung's third smartphone device that has shown a battery fault, due to a defect related to manufacturing tolerances. Both devices were sold within a limited time. The defect exposed a proprietary manufacturing process in which a battery is manufactured and shipped with the device wrapped in protective packaging. The Note7 is a device that Apple created for its larger mobile OS.

Earlier this year, Samsung announced that it would discontinue its Note 7 line. It promised to recall its next batch of phones, and it pledged to improve manufacturing tolerances. Since then, no other smartphones in the Note 7 family have suffered any battery defects, which Samsung blamed on defective suppliers in China.

Samsung said at the time that the new production methods were "no better" than the first batch. The company also revealed that it also had an updated process for manufacturing the batteries of the new phones, which it said it used in its earlier batches.
