 meant that people under that age would be unable to use services to look up friends and family, check up on the latest gossip, or even just keep in touch with loved ones. That particular proposal would have effectively outlawed apps like Kik and Telegram for kids, just because they offer messaging.

It didn’t.

Instead, the government proposed changing the law to make such data-sharing optional – as long as parents give their consent to it. This proposed change was backed by the government in February.

I asked about the proposal and its likely impact on the ability of children to get to know their parents or friends.

On 16 November, I spoke with a senior officer at the Canadian government, who was not authorised to speak on behalf of the department.

I asked whether the change in the law would affect messaging services such as Kik, WhatsApp and Telegram in particular.

I also asked what evidence the department had of “the harm suffered by children whose parents have not consented for their data to be used by services like Facebook”.

It turns out that such data could be abused for all sorts of things by those who have such profiles.

I told the senior officer that a child whose parents don’t want their data shared could in principle still use a messaging app to talk to his friend for a few days if his parent didn’t tell them he didn’t want his photos and video shared. He may be given access to certain apps, but not necessarily.

The official also told me that the government does not know exactly when a parent would be able to decide what his child did on his mobile’s home screen. On average, he would be allowed a few days of use. If, like many parents who I spoke to, he used an app on his phone at school that his kid never wanted there, he could end up with a lot more
