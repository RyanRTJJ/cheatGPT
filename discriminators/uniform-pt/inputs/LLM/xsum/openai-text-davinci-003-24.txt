r recreational or commercial reasons, some cross for humanitarian reasons or to reunite families. The two countries have agreements in place to help ensure a smooth and secure border crossing experience. 

On the Canadian side of the border, the Canada Border Services Agency is responsible for all immigration and customs processing. The agency, working in collaboration with the US government, has developed a process for ensuring cross-border security, including preclearance programs that allow travellers to clear immigration, customs, and some agricultural controls before they travel. The Canada Border Services Agency screens all travellers entering the country to ensure they meet all legal requirements.

A major challenge at the Canada-US border is the recent influx of people seeking to enter the US without proper immigration status. This has led to an increase in illegal immigration attempts, which puts strain on resources along the border and has led to longer wait times for legal arrivals. Other problems, like a lack of resources or coordination between Canadian and US immigration enforcement, can create additional difficulties for those crossing the border. 

Despite these challenges, the Canada-US border remains one of the worldâ€™s longest, most secure borders. Both countries are working together to ensure an efficient and secure process for visitors. With the right resources and continued collaboration, it is possible to maintain a safe and secure border while still allowing people to travel freely.
