 from merchants and tourists.

At least seven of the performers are wearing wigs or masks â€” "I won't say how many are wigs," Mr. Peeples wrote. "That's an important part of the show."

The show is free to the spectators.

"This is New York City at its best," said Mr. Peeples as he introduced the cast by city and state. There were three "street performers" each from New Jersey and New York, one from the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Other performers include those who perform "Sleight of Hand," using magic tricks on coins, and "Juggle Me," where the "magic" is juggling balls. They are trained in performing in the street, an art form that dates to the middle ages, and have their own costume and props.

"It's a real New York moment," Mr. Wooten said as he juggled a coin. "This is New York City. This is Times Square. This is America."

He said he spends about $500 and gets by with handouts and sales of other juggling props.

The group arrived on Sept. 29 for a three-week run on the streets of Times Square.

Mr. Peeples said about 300 people showed up at a recent open house.

To become accepted in Manhattan this summer, the group had gone to schools in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Washington state.

"It's been very hard and stressful to get them into the city and here the day before," Mr. Peeples said. "It's not something that's easy to do."

He noted that the performers had received mixed reactions in Philadelphia, where they performed for many nights in August.

"We can't guarantee their safety with these rules, but we can make sure they're safe while they're in the city," he said.

The rules for pedestrian plazas call for no more than eight performers at the same time, no live animals and no street performers performing in the daytime.

The performers can be no taller than 5-foot-3 and no thinner than 5-foot in, and must always wear a hat with a clear crown.
