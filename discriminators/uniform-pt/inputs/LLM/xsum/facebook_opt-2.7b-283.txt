The Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, announced the news at a news conference last night after receiving a final report from an Australian-based team that is looking for the disappeared plane.

Dr Tony Burrows, the Australian lead investigator, told the prime minister that “no further progress has been made since 2015 in the search area for MH370 based on new possible leads”, according to a news release from his office.

“The Australian team was supported through 2017. The Malaysian government has funded the search costs and the Australian team has assisted in analysing new satellite images.”

The Australian experts have travelled to Kuala Lumpur and will join the Malaysian government team searching for the plane.

Mr Razak told journalists that he had ordered a three-month pause in the search in the southern Indian Ocean for reasons that were “personal”.

“I deeply apologise to all the families of the plane crash victims,” he said. “It is unacceptable that some have said I have closed the door to the search.”

The search was suspended in January after two years yielded little to no results. No body has been found or any trace of the plane.

In another development related to the MH370 case, Malaysia’s home minister had announced yesterday that families of the victims of the flight would receive compensation totalling almost RM6 billion (S$2.4 billion) under a new “reconstruction of life” scheme.

Malaysia Airlines has already settled personal claims against the airline for nearly RM2 billion, while another payment of more than RM4.2 billion has been settled by Malaysia’s transport ministry.

“Families will receive RM4.2 billion from the government to be divided equally between compensation for loss of life and compensation for loss of property,” said Mr M. Kulasingam.

“There are two categories of compensation in the scheme—compensation for actual economic losses and compensation for pain and suffering. The compensation may range anywhere between RM300,000 for a single loss of life and RM4.7 million for a single loss of property.�
