-seeking cyclists and runners - and dogs - ride over the city centre's cobbles. For riders, the experience involves tackling the cobbles using a bicycle with the front wheel removed to provide extra support. For runners, the idea is to jump between some of the walls of a medieval town.

The event took place on Sunday afternoon and proved a real boon to the area's economy. It brought in an economic benefit to the city of £45,000, according to the city council.

The report found that the Capital’s emissions must be cut by 60% in 2020 and Edinburgh Council have set a target to achieve this by 2030.

But in a climate change debate, a city known for its love of cheese is likely to have made some enemies. Among those who took part was Andrew Laming MP, who has been criticised for holding a series of climate change events behind closed doors, including one with a “secret” message about his views on climate change and the Royal Family.

The event took place on the same day he had to be grilled by Scotland’s Parliament for refusing to disclose his views on climate change. And many of Edinburgh's citizens took to Twitter to express their amusement at a protest organised by the cheese rollers. Tweets included: “Climate change? Cheese in the City? Noice!”

“It’s an anti-climate change rally, and we’re running it in the heat,” said one of the organisers, whose real name is Chris McKeown. “We are hoping it will turn out to be an interesting day in the political environment.”
