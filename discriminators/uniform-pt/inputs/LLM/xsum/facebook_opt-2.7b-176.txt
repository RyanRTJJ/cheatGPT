 (A*-C), three good (A**-C) and three good (A*-C) GCSE grade 8 or above than did last summer, but it will take a further 13 years for the south’s performance gap to close.

And according to the latest OFSTED report for England, the gap widened in 2015, rising to 7.1 percentage points.

The firm’s analysis of the GCSE results in England this summer, reveals some regional inequalities.

Almost 60 per cent of pupils nationally will take up two or more subjects this summer. In the south, three fifths will.

It shows a similar pattern in England overall – the south is the only region in England where it is the norm to take more than two grades out of four and outperform their peers at GCSE.

Gillian Guy, executive director at SchoolDash, said: “Although the gap in performance between the north and south of England has closed this summer, a further 13 years will still need to pass before the north has caught up with the south’s performances.

“Despite this, the north of England has seen a significant increase in the number of schools in the highest league table of overall GCSE results.

“This is likely to reflect the increasing diversity of schools that are participating in the system and in schools which have been taken over from school authority running as academies.”

Among GCSE results from 2015 schools that had their foundation phase transferred to academies are:
