 teams with Argentina and Brazil, Asia's two major teams, joining the league.

Sanzaar said in a statement that the decision had been taken after analysing results from the first phase, which consisted of three groups of six teams, the second phase, which included the top six teams from each group, and the third and final phase, which were played by the winner of each group against the runner-up.

World Cup hosts and world champions Germany, along with the top four sides from South Africa's Tri Nations, are now out of the tournament with Australia also in the qualifying zone. Japan, which reached the semi finals in 2008, also have been dropped after failing to qualify.

Australia's final game at the World Cup was a one-sided defeat against New Zealand who topped the group with a 100-7 thumping of Tonga, a result which secured them the title and the automatic qualification for next year's tournament.

The result left Australia with a slim 0-1 win-loss record which saw them eliminated.

South Africa's last World Cup appearance was at the 2003 tournament in Australia and New Zealand, when the Springboks lifted the Webb Ellis Cup following a 22-12 defeat against England.

The Springboks began their bid for a second successive title by crushing Fiji 56-7 at Newlands but then lost 24-11 to eventual tournament winners France.

South Africa finished the tournament in third place while Australia came in fourth.

The next stop is the November window when a handful of matches will be played by the teams in the qualifiers.
