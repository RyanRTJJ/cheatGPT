 that it suspected "seafood poisoning" caused the death of the people who ate them.

Four victims have been infected in the past two weeks. Their death caused "shock" in the Hong Kong, the CFS said.

"They reported eating fish, especially salmon, in the past week to week and a half. The victims said that the symptoms started at the onset of the illness, and they all died within four days," the CFS said.

"People who had bought the fish were advised not to eat them. The Public Health Department has also closed several fish markets in the Kowloon peninsula," the CFS added.

The CFS said that the fish farms in China had been producing contaminated or overgrown fish and that it would continue to monitor the issue.

The disease was linked to the outbreak of Shigella flexneri infection on the west coast of China. It was found at two fish facilities in Guangdong province, where 40 people contracted the disease.

There were two more cases of the disease on Hong Kong’s east coast. The CFS said that it was also conducting tests to prove if the illness was caused by the outbreak of a bacterial infection called shigellosis or by another type of bacterium called pseudomonas aeruginosa.

However, the CFS said that it suspected that the people who died were infected with the seafood-borne illness.

“All food sold should be declared and health warnings issued so that the public takes the advice seriously,” Health Secretary Leung Ka-wai told a news conference, the South China Morning Post reported.
