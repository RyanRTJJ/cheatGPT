 of Ireland and Iceland by two points at Wembley.

Ireland played their third game when Duncan Edwards went on loan to Wigan when the club was relegated in 2010, and they returned to the top level in June following their 4-1 triumph in the League Cup final at Wembley.

Celtic, despite their struggles at times this season, will be hoping to finish above their Welsh rivals in the Six Nations. Celtic have a 16-point lead at mid-table and are also four points adrift of the top three.

The All Blacks and Canada have the easiest schedule of qualifying.

Wales beat England 2-1 in Cardiff last September to progress to the next round, while Japan held a similar meeting between England and Australia while Argentina faced Belgium in their quarter-final.

The All Blacks will want to have all their opponents rested for Saturday's game as they had last year in Cardiff.

It will be the only time this World Cup in Australia that Japan will be without their All Blacks wing-back and leading try-scorer Matt Todd after he was ruled out of the win over the Springboks as a result of ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.

Canada play England in a highly-anticipated Six Nations match with the hosts hoping they can become only the second team in history to beat the All Blacks since they won the 1954 World Cup.

Meanwhile, France - chasing just a single World Cup win after losing to the All Blacks - face England and Scotland in the opening round of the Six Nations with both teams needing seven points to advance to the second round.
