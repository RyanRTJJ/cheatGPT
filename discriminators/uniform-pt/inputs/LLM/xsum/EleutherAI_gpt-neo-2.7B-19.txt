 this season.

After a first start on the left of midfield, Ellison could have been a contender for Man of the Match for the 3-0 win over Chelsea at Selhurst Park on Sunday. Instead, the match finished 0-0 because of a defensive wobble, although David Silva would later score another late goal against Liverpool.

Ellison's time spent at Loftus Road ended after just 10 months. He had joined from Fulham in a deal that saw Wes Brown move in the opposite direction to a new contract at Stamford Bridge.

He would end his career as the top-scorer in all three top level games he played for QPR. The club have not made a single permanent signing in a 12-month period:

No 10: QPR sign two players after the club’s first £20million in sales £17.5m, £5.1m and £5.7m - £3M after transfer window

The club have now picked up 10 new faces in one summer, following a £5.7million summer spend. The spending spree has seen QPR spend £7.5million, with the signing of midfielder Ben Gladwell leading the list.

Gadwell has come in for criticism in some quarters as he is the first signing. It is thought that QPR are being conservative with the signing, while there are doubts about his ability to break into the club's first team.

QPR chief executive Graham Westley had the deal announced on the day before the club flew out for America's SuperCup with a new squad.

Ellison joined QPR in 2000 from fellow Premier League side Fulham and went on to make 149 appearances for the club.

He is set to have his QPR badge made into a statue in his honour at Loftus Road, when he leaves the club, so he'll be forever part of the first team dressing room.
