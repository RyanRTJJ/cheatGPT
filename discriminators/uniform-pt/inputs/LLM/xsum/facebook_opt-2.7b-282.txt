 plane had been cleared to fly by a safety official, he added.

A spokesperson for airline Lufthansa confirmed that the flight had landed at the Munich airport "safely. No further flight movements are possible".

A passenger who would only identify himself as Stephan told German news broadcaster n-tv that the plane had circled in the air "for 10 to 15 minutes" before making an emergency landing.

He said the pilot had been shouting "emergency situation".

The Airbus A320-200 jet left Hamburg at 21:53 (17:53 GMT) for the Turkish resort of Bodrum. It is due to take off at 20:50.

Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said he "feels for the passengers", adding that the airline has "set up a support team for them and their families".

An internal investigation has been launched and the two crew members involved have been suspended, he added.

The captain took over the controls about half an hour before landing.

Passengers in the cabin reported a loud bang, a passenger named Stephan had been quoted as saying by Bild newspaper.

The Airbus plane had left Hamburg Airport at 17:53 local time (16:53 GMT) and was headed to Antalya. But because of technical reasons the crew requested to land in Munich at 18:28 local time.

The plane had only just begun its descent when passengers reported difficulties and alerted the cabin crew.

Passengers took to Twitter to recount the chaos. The flight information displays at both Hamburg and Munich airports were down, flight monitoring company Flightradar24 reported.

A technical malfunction involving an aircraft is extremely rare indeed - in fact, they are so rare that they're included in a separate flight safety document known as the Aviation Safety Directive.

The Airbus A320-200 aircraft was manufactured in 2000. The German airline was the first operator to operate the plane.

The aircraft has had a successful track record for safety, according to Flightstats, a Berlin-based aviation firm.

It has accumulated more than 1.2 million flight hours, or 7.7 flights per hour, with no major incidents - and only one minor mishap was reported more
