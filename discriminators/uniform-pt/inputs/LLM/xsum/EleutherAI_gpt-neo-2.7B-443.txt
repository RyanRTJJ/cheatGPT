" has produced mixed results, with the shops finding that it has been very beneficial to them, but at the expense of the Welsh economy.

The changes they would like to see are the following: a "super return" for Welsh citizens, so that foreign tax paid on purchases in Wales would be deducted; a tax-free status for imports from the UK; and higher rates of tax for imports.

The Welsh tax commission says that this would cost Wales about 2,500 jobs, as well as a huge amount of tax revenue, as well as creating an unfair situation between Wales and the rest of the UK.

And then there are the political implications. Tax on imports is "a very touchy subject", says Caelyr Edwards CBE, the secretary of Crickhowell, but he adds that there are concerns about "unethical traders" in Wales.

He adds: "There has been a lot of misinformation. The UK's [Welsh] tax rules are very simple, there are no special rates on foreign goods."

If it is decided that the Welsh government will do what it can to introduce changes, it might not be able to change the rules on the EU single market for two or three years. And as it stands, it remains very difficult to change the tax system where imported goods are subject to VAT and not excise.

However, the tax system is not the only factor at play in the decision to import from outside of Wales.

There is also the matter of public transport. If the shops are to operate out of warehouses, then a big issue will be parking.

But as a former business owner living in Crickhowell, I feel that I am in a unique position to help to make the local economy much stronger and the town much more enjoyable to live in.

With so many new opportunities in the area, I would be happy to see another large building development coming to the town.

It is true that the tax system is not the only factor at play in the town's decision to import from overseas, but what I would say is that the town itself will remain much stronger, more attractive
