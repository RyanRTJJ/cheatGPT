 a side that will challenge Liverpool for the top four, and added:

It's clear we must build on what we have already done. I expect we will have more success on the pitch but we also want to be on the right path and I'm sure there will be a change in the leadership at the end of the season.

He added: 'I will never forget the joy I got this season as a player for Swansea and I hope to represent at least as much for the club as I did for them.'

Meanwhile, Gylfi Sigurdsson could face up to two months out through a knee injury suffered playing for Iceland against France. He could miss the away leg of that World Cup qualifier (10 April) as well as the game at the Liberty Stadium.

Chairman Huw Jenkins said: 'Gylfi was carrying a knee injury throughout the week and we anticipate it will impact on his availability for both tomorrow's EFL Cup game and the game at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday.'

Wigan Athletic midfielder Aaron Mooy is in contention to return to the starting line-up for Sunday's Premier League game at home to Liverpool.

Chairman Dave Whelan said: 'It's an issue. We think Aaron's got a minor hamstring problem so we could test him at half-time tomorrow and see how he feels.'

West Bromwich Albion have no new injuries but it's likely that midfielder Jonny Evans will start tonight against Manchester United.

Newly promoted Aston Villa, meanwhile, will be without their top scorer Ross McCormack until October as he continues to recover from a back injury.

The 29-year-old started and finished the 4-0 win at Watford on Saturday but is expected to be sidelined for another 10 weeks.

Manager Tim Sherwood said: 'He's starting to make progress but that's all there is. His training is going smoothly but there's a lot more left to be done. We have some tests coming up and he's got to get through those.'
