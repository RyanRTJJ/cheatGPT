 Chris Jordan, 22, was in Eastbourne Hospital during the incident. A neighbour told the Bristol Post: "He played his cricket at home and when he showed up at school it was all business; he was polite." Another resident said he saw him with the woman at about 11pm while they sat down for dinner. He said: "She was sitting in a chair opposite the door with the TV on because Chris was there but she wouldn't open the door. I saw her and the man and she immediately said she'd just left him. "When I asked what they were talking about she said he was talking about his parents and said she wasn't going to ask him if he was ok again." Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: "There was one lady sitting next to him and when I asked who she was and if she was his mum, she said yes, she's from Eastbourne. She was chatting away when I saw her she went into a foyer of the house. When I left she was gone. I rang him up and let him know and said he couldn't see my face that day. I never saw him again." The man from Eastbourne told Bristol Post that he had known Chris before his father, who was a taxi driver. "There'll be no place for him in this world," he added. - SOPHIE MCKENNA
