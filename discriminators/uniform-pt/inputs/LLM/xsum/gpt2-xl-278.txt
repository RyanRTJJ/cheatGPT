But the Department for Transport said road accidents would actually have fallen in recent years, thanks to a combination of changes to safety equipment and the introduction of 3G.

The government has repeatedly said that 3G is helping to improve road safety, and some research suggests it also reduces crash risk by as much as 20%.

But the research, which was commissioned by the RAC and published in a report by the Institute of Advanced Motorists, suggests the increase in driver safety was largely artificial.

It found drivers were distracted by other tasks in addition to talking on phones, such as checking their emails, reading maps or checking their mobile phone battery life.

The IAM report noted that while 2% of drivers were found to be reading an online news article while driving, this was now 40% of all cases.

The news was similar in practice on other forms of distracted driving. For instance, while a fifth of drivers were now texting other drivers, that proportion rises to 40% when it comes to drivers in cars.

The report concluded that while drivers are now talking on their phones and driving in the knowledge that they have a hands-free option, they are not more alert to the road or themselves.

It added: "Many drivers appear to be engaging with their mobile devices whilst in the control of a vehicle, but by this measure they may be less aware of the surroundings."

There had been some increase in the number of phone-related deaths. "However," the IAM said, "the death toll has remained relatively stable, at just under 100 deaths in the UK in the years between 2011 and 2013.

"Drivers can take heart that they are safer than they were 20 years ago but this is largely due to a continued decrease in the national fatality rate, which in recent years has fallen to its lowest level since the 1920s."
