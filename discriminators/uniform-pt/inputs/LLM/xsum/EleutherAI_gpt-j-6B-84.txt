, according to the American Lyme Disease Foundation.

The recent study is one of the largest to investigate the relationship between Lyme disease and other tick species to come out of the U.S., said study author Adam LaPorte, a geologist at the University of New Hampshire in Durham.

"If there were no other co-infecting tick that was so efficient in transmitting the pathogens, there would be some relationship," he told NBC News in an email.

LaPorte said he's working on a project to search the rest of New Hampshire for similar cases. He said there's some potential that Lyme disease could eventually infect ticks in other parts of the U.S., but it's unlikely.

The researchers say it will take time to fully understand the cause of the Lyme disease outbreak, but they're hopeful they've given some new insights that will help future investigations.

"We do know that it is possible to infect dogs with other organisms such as Borrelia and tick-bite fever, and these are all transmitted to humans via tick bites," Stucki told NBC News. "Therefore, it's likely that similar scenarios may also be applicable to ticks being responsible for the increased prevalence of Lyme disease in humans."

"The next step is to determine this further in different geographical locations, both in the U.S. and globally," Wikel added. "The more places we look, the more likely we are to reveal some previously unconsidered associations that might prove influential in the future epidemiology of Lyme disease."
