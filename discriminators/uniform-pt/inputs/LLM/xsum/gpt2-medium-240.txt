 national economic and trade policies which have led to a sharp trade imbalance, with the UK having more of the goods and services than the US.

The Ministry of Defence has signed an agreement with Airbus to offer a specialist contract to staff to help with equipment delivery to Britain in exchange for 10 per cent of their gross profit or a fixed price.

The deal is worth £30.95 million of funds from the sale of UK combat planes and fighter helicopters and also includes £5.5 million in direct funding. Staff will also receive training in defence technology, with the government promising its staff will be responsible for ensuring the most up-to-date weapons systems are fitted to the systems and systems suppliers.

A total of 12 of Britain's leading civil and defence officials have signed up to the offer, as is the Ministry of Defence.

The Government says the offer will help ensure that defence and security technology and operations can continue to thrive in a challenging and competitive world. Staff will take up the role on 15 January, the same day Boris Johnson is about to give the National Security Strategy a green light for parliament.

The MoD has already delivered 15,000 Tornado R5 aircraft – including up to 100,000 in order to be delivered to the UK before Christmas – and is expected to be able to deliver another 11,000 R5s within a few months.

David Lidington, Defence Secretary, said: "UK defence and security is a vital area for security in the world. Ensuring a strong presence in this market means we're able to meet the increasing challenges of the global internet age while keeping our forces and equipment as sharp as they are.

"This offer is an important step because it gives the Government's civil staff the skills, training and knowledge they need to achieve this."

The MoD has an estimated 3,000 civil staff working alongside all the armed forces in its defence sector. It expects around 900 contracts already have been signed but the initial scale is yet to be reached.
