 time laws.

Some countries include the time taken for lunch breaks in their working week and on the weekend. Others will accept the time.

The change comes after a year of negotiations by the EU-wide working time agreement unit (WTU).

But the change is likely to have an impact on some businesses.

Dorset-based travel company British Airways will take “all reasonable” action on an EU ruling that their timecards must be more detailed in 2018.

“This has no impact on us and is entirely down to our new CEO taking this on board,” a BA spokesman said

However, Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin, has criticised the work-life balance proposals.

The UK’s largest travel company is understood to be considering whether to continue to abide by EU working time rules.

The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Passive employers know that they can’t cut their workforce.

“They have been forced to adopt and enforce EU working time rules, even as their workforce shrinks for reasons beyond their control.”

There will be “no free lunch” for employers in the event that the regulations are changed, she added.

‘Dilution of working week’

EU officials said that although employers can and should make reasonable efforts to be consistent, they would lose some flexibility if they were forced to spend more time at work during the year.

Diverse businesses will be more affected, they added. They pointed to the example of food delivery companies like Deliveroo - where 40 per cent of its workforce is employed by private investors to run the business.

But after 2016, that was cut to five days unless they were “very specialised and complex businesses”.

The UK's largest transport company Virgin has said it plans to continue with the regulations.

A working time spokesman said: “
