When asked by Police Scotland for comment on the verdict, the family’s lawyer, Brian Whittle, said: “At no time did Stephen Bell take any pornographic image of children himself.

“Had he taken any material he would have faced arrest.”

Defence lawyer Brian Whittle has called for Scotland to implement tougher controls on the internet and pornography and has said this kind of offence should be a criminal offence.

He said: “I think it is a serious matter, particularly as the content is of such a grotesque nature. This case has led to a review of the internet’s role in child sexual abuse, as well as other crimes.

“It is certainly something that deserves greater attention in Scotland and I have suggested to the Scottish government it becomes an offence to post pornographic images on the internet.”

‘What happened in this trial was not an aberration, but the tip of an iceberg.’

“This was not child pornography but sick videos, and he would have been charged under the law.

“This is a criminal offence – a non-existent offence in Scotland.”

Mr Whittle added the trial itself was a ‘total waste of resources, time, money and the taxpayer’s money’.

‘As an attorney I have advised that all people be given a fair trial.

‘That does not mean the people get a fair trial in Scotland.

‘And I think to have made the charges where they were makes it doubly difficult, as a criminal charge is the only way to convict him.’

During the sentencing hearing, Mr Whittle said he did not agree with the Crown’s view that there was reasonable cause to suspect that Mr Bell could possess child abuse images.

‘You had no evidence of possessing any of the videos described in the indictment, which was a nonsense. You had no evidence of accessing any of the material as you described.

‘What happened in this trial was not an aberration, but the tip of an iceberg. And we would not be surprised
