, and was one of the most influential social psychologists on the panel.

The problem with the whole discussion, he argued, is that the public just isn’t persuaded by information which is presented as a moral imperative.

There is a danger with the idea of social change and the message that can be promoted to the public, that if you use fear-mongering we can get the public to understand the right to food or safety in some way.

And with such messages we can begin to change behaviours, but not without a large amount of risk from an extremist, populist, conservative side.

– The Right-to-Food campaign is a good example where the danger is clear – the campaign has a political message. The problem, though, is that we get a message that is political, instead of being an educational one about the dangers of obesity – what are you feeding your child, with the wrong diet and lifestyle habits?

– How will the right-to-food campaign be received by people living in our cities, where the issue is obviously far more complex?

– Also important is that it appeals to the emotions of the public, in order to change their behaviour – we could say that it works by changing people’s emotions. But what if it’s wrong to use the emotions of the public, and that’s where we have problems?

– Our society is very emotionally driven. If you talk and argue long enough at the right audience it won’t go away, even if the argument points out flaws in our society and what is wrong with it.

– People’s emotions are very powerful, and we do often see problems that seem intractable, but once they are exposed to emotion it makes it a lot easier to find a solution to them, it does however take away the emotion, and in doing so allows us to find better solutions to complex problems.
