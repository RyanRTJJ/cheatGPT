 2008 financial crisis can sue Goldman Sachs, so can private citizens alleging fraud. And if that is so, they should not be barred from pursuing those claims because the bank's former head, Hank Paulson, acted on their behalf.

The decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of a former executive at the investment firm AIG, was unanimous. The lower court had first dismissed the suit without even hearing it. The 9th, which is based in California, has jurisdiction over claims against Goldman, along with the former New York Fed Chief Hank Paulson and a former chief of staff for the Office of Financial Research at the New York Fed.

The AIG executive, Richard Fuld, sued AIG several years after the 2008 crash, claiming that he was pushed out because of his refusal to give in to pressure from Goldman executives. Goldman denied that it had played a role in the ouster.

The suit ended up in the lower court, which found for the bank. The 9th said that the claims against Paulson, the New York Fed and the NY Fed's former chief of staff, Mark Patterson, were "legally sufficient" to meet the standard set by the Supreme Court in the Citizens United ruling, which holds that a corporation does not lose its right to free speech when it makes a financial contribution to a candidate or other political organization. Patterson was also AIG's former general counsel, who acted as an adviser for Paulson and others.

This was an issue of First Amendment law, said the 9th Circuit, in a split opinion that affirmed the district court's judgment without comment.

'There's no question that AIG, which was at the heart of the financial crisis, was harmed. And that harmed them directly... There were multiple theories that they were harmed and that harmed them. They're very, very damaged,' said Judge Sandra Ikuta, who wrote the opinion. These two separate sets of claims should be considered, she said.

AIG filed two sets of claims against Goldman Sachs in the district court in the first case, one for underperforming loan
