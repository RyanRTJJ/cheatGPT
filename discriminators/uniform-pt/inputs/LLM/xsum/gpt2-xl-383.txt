 quarterfinal showdown against archrival Brazil. With England missing their two main offensive threats -- John Terry and Wayne Rooney -- who were both suspended, Sampson opted for a more defensive lineup to stop Brazil, but it failed.

Nahki Wells

Nahki Wells is more familiar with the league than Sampson had. Wells has served two stints as the Seattle Sounders starting goalkeeper -- first in 2006, then more recently as the team's backup in 2010. And just like Sampson did with Jones, Wells has made a name for himself during his two-year run in the league's top North American tier. Last season, Wells led the MLS Golden Boot race with 37 goals.

However, when Sampson left the Sounders, Wells was forced out of the starting XI. He played well during the first round but only started one more game after that. By 2010, Wells had been out of soccer for seven years and it looked like he had completely lost his touch. With the Philadelphia Union and now the New England Revolution having both shown interest in Wells, maybe he's finally re-emerged on top form.

Tim Howard

In his career, Tim Howard is 12-for-12 when the U.S. scores first. That includes nine goals in the 2010 World Cup. On Wednesday night, the U.S. came away with a shutout against Belgium, but it wasn't because Howard was an unsung hero. Rather, he was the best U.S. player, scoring three goals and denying three goals.

"I would give him every chance to start for the third consecutive game," Sampson said. "If we need a little bit more courage, if we need a little bit more belief to get over the line then I think Tim is the right guy."

Howard's current contract with the Revs runs through January, but he's not the only one who could be asked to fill in for Sampson. The Revs are in the run-up to an MLS
