The £40m unit will provide assembly, maintenance and modification work for the Bombardier Global electric locomotive (AGL) fleet.

GD will have 30 workers on site, with up to 40 construction and transport engineering staff on site to assist throughout the two-year investment programme.

In late January it was announced that GD had agreed a firm order to build 85 Bombardier AGLs.

GD, which has built train-makers in Swindon and East Lothian, is keen to diversify its commercial activities because of Brexit.

The factory, in the south of the UK, has about 200,000 sq ft, with a further 130,000 sq ft build bay for heavy-duty equipment.

GD says that the works will provide a significant local employment boost – to around 250 in the long-term and 250 in the short-term.

Chief executive Tom Pendergast said: “We are very excited to be announcing this new facility and the associated economic benefits for the local community.

“The construction of the new facility is planned to be completed by the end of 2020 and our initial investment is planned to be around £40m.

“This facility is an integral part of our strategy to become a leader in commercial activities supporting our military programmes and customers.

“We intend to use this facility as a core component of our diversified manufacturing portfolio, and are extremely excited by the opportunities this new facility presents.”

GD chief financial officer David Bockelson said: “This is another important milestone on our path towards achieving our operational and financial goals.

“This new facility will serve as a regional hub for our commercial activities and provide significant support for GD’s efforts to diversify our business and become the most profitable and trusted firm in a rapidly growing and important industry.

“We intend to use the facility as an integral part of our diversified base to support our military programmes and our customers across the United States and Europe. This new site gives us the ability to add a new skill base to support GD’s growing portfolio of products.”
