 Walker is in Belfast where the union’s North Down branch has handed a five-point charter to the school management. He speaks to the union’s organiser and assistant general secretary, John Kennedy.

A one day strike by NASUWT members at a number of schools in Belfast and Newtownabbey is set to take place next week.

NASUWT members at schools such as Banbridge, Glenavy, Newtownabbey Grammar, North Down Primary, Belfast Academy, Dunmurry and Ballyclare High are all understood to be planning to stage the industrial action over pay, jobs and workload.

It is understood there will be pickets outside of schools on the day and union members and their supporters will also take part a picket line outside Belfast City Hall.

The union’s North Down branch said it is seeking several demands which include pay rise, the restoration of jobs, the abolition of “administrative duties” and fair workload.

Speaking to the News Letter, NASUWT assistant general secretary John Kennedy said: “Our members are committed to the job but we need an end to the ‘pay for performance’ system which is placing pressure on members jobs.

“The NASUWT wants to put a stop to this, we don’t view this as strike action, it’s more the NASUWT calling for employers to see that all staff need to be put in the box when it comes to calculating pay.

“We also want the schools management to put more focus on the teaching job, as well as looking for ways to improve workload.

“There are more than 6,000 NASUWT members at the Northern Ireland schools and all are fully committed. However many of the staff are overstretched and as a union we feel that there are some issues within the schools we want to raise with employers.

“We have put the five points charter to them and they are saying they will meet them but they haven’t put out a response yet.”

The union has urged its members to be involved in the pickets as well as outside the schools.
