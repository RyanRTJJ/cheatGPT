The HMRC said that about 10% was "under tax" and that about another 15% applied at "other income".

HMRC said that it was in the process of "clarifying" the data, but insisted that it would "never, ever" refer to the HMRC.

"We need to establish what is being claimed on a tax return, and we don't do that for individuals under 25," said a spokesman. "There were 12,500 individuals here last year who claimed tax in the UK, of whom 5,500 claimed tax. That is 7.3% of the population.

It is very hard to get on the same page as HMRC and people have an expectation that HMRC must have some authority, but they can see what is being recorded on the books which is not necessarily what is actually there.

It is a very complex technical issue, and it is something that we are not going to say on the official page."

HMRC added that it had also taken "preliminary steps" to increase transparency and reduce tax avoidance,
