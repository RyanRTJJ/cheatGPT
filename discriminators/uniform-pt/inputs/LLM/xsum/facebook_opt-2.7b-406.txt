 did not act violently towards McAlroy or his wife Claire but was convicted of attempted murder after the jury found he was the one to pull the trigger. He could have faced a life sentence but was offered an eventual minimum of 20 years without parole for the attempted murder. He also received an extended sentence for possession of a weapon - a sawn-off shotgun, with the intent to cause fear and to endanger the life of his wife.

The trial at Hamilton Sheriff Court heard that when Gage met Claire, they got on well. When they returned home from a holiday Gage, who was separated from his wife, decided to kill her. To get her alone he sent her a text that began "I am just a normal guy who likes his family," and ended with the line "my guns are packed". The trial began after a jury found Gage guilty in his absence in October. Gage said he knew nothing about the killings but claimed McAlroy had been "a nuisance" to his wife. "He wasn't good for Claire," he said.

McAlroy, who had a young son, was killed when Gage fired three shots at him in the couple's home and then put the shotgun through its own front door. He and his wife had been drinking vodka and red wine in the living room. McAlroy's wife was also shot. The shooting was over property the pair had borrowed from a friend, Mr Brown. Gage said: "I'm not going out for a fag any more, I have a job and I'm good for it."

His lawyer, Alan Webster, said Gage's crime was not planned out. He had got jealous of his wife's drinking, had sent her to bed, and when he saw the friends loan his wife and his own money "he had no option to shoot them".

His lawyer said that he had been treated badly as an immigrant: "He had difficulty with English, with the police, the judges, with his wife, the English. He tried to fight them all in one way or another."

Webster said that he had been left "mentally scarred" by Gage's
