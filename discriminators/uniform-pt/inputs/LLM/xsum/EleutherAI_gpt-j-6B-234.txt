 resolve to invest "enormously" in the area.

"This is a massive win, not only for the north London borough of Haringey, which has set out to redevelop Regents Park, but for Tottenham Hotspur too," added Levy.

"We have known our own strengths and weaknesses for years. This investment was about the long term and we are now confident that we will be able to attract even better talent at a young age and to make our training ground an even better home for the players we have.

"We have put a lot of thought into this decision to grow the academy and the project of having a training academy right at the heart of our academy. By doing so, both in terms of the physical development of the facility and the social environment, we are helping to produce the best players and to encourage more of our stars to stay."

Spurs have had academy facilities at Hotspur Way since 2004 but the current main stadium training centre will be built in the heart of a residential area and accessible to local schools.

Levy said the club's other decision to create a residential academy in Enfield, away from White Hart Lane, was about long term planning. A site of that size could not be ignored but was not the priority it is to the north London club.

"In the end we decided that we wanted to develop the facility in the heart of Tottenham and get people to live in the area. We believe that this is a much greater project than even the White Hart Lane site. The land at Hotspur Way came as a godsend but this is going to be a much bigger and more significant project."

Haringey's regeneration is designed to create a mixture, in a similar manner to Tottenham's partnership with Enfield, the local borough, where more than 5,000 new homes will be constructed.

The investment, which will mean the opening of new schools, businesses, community facilities, an open parkland zone and a primary school, includes a state-of-the-art facility for training and education. Spurs will play
