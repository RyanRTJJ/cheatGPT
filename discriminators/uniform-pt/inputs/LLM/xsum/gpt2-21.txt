 recommends a daily pace of 15 minutes of physical activity per day.

In addition to exercising, the research found that individuals who took part in 100 minutes per day could take part in some 200 different activities, like reading books.

People who spent more time on the outdoors did this by training. Those with limited social skills also took part as they practiced their range of skills in outdoor activities, such as making use of a backpack.

The study, published online in the journal Climatic Research, also shows an inverse relationship between the levels of activity and health care access for older adults.

However, a smaller group also increased activity in their lifetime that had not been measured.

"Our finding shows that there is no direct relationship between the level of activity and health care access for older adults, as long as their daily level of activity doesn't improve much," said Chris Jones of the University of Cambridge.

"It's not the case that individuals living in poverty might be less physical at the end of an afternoon. This suggests that physical activity is linked with healthier health-care access."

The study was conducted by the Centre for Nutrition Research at the University of Nottingham, in partnership with the Institute of Medicine.

Abstract

Health care access is a major public health intervention that can influence economic productivity and long-term social wellbeing. However, only 30% of women in the UK are obese, and women are less likely to take part in such activity than men.

There is considerable focus in the public and commercial arena on efforts to improve access to health care and to prevent chronic diseases (such as heart disease and diabetes) through the provision and administration of health services, which have a high mortality and morbidity, but this does not reflect the health and well-being of
