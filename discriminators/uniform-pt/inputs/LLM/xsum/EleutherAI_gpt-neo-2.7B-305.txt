In practice, it treated all people, regardless of their circumstances, as disposable,” the commission said.

“The employment relationship was thus structured across the board on a basis of discrimination and abuse and of inequality,” the commission said in a submission to parliament’s inquiry.

But the commission’s report also criticised the company for spending “far more than average for a small company on expensive non-staff ‘events’ and travel”.

The company took a further 12 months to deal with complaints from those who experienced harassment as a result of its policies, but only a short number were investigated.

The commission highlighted the findings as it began investigating other companies that it considered had similar policies and for which workers were not treated equally.

The commission said it believed it would take legal action against BHS, but it had received no official decision on whether it would do so. The investigation is continuing.
