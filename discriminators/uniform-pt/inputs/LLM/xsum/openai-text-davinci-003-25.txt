rd term in power. Mbonimpa was attacked and shot on August 3, 2015. He survived after being treated for two bullet wounds in his neck and arms at Bujumbura's Centre Hospitalier du Renouveau. He had previously already been arrested and threatened; he had spoke out in denunciation of the Burundian government and its actions which many believe has led to a serious political turmoil. He later claimed that it was a targeted attack on him by the government meant to send a message of silence to other human rights activists.

Mbonimpa's organization, the Association pour la protection des droits humains et des personnes d√©tenues (APDH), has been active in denouncing Nkurunziza's decision to remain in power for a third term despite the 2-term limit set down in the Burundian constitution. APDH joined protests in the streets of Bujumbura against the president's actions, and the group was declared illegal by the Burundian government in April 2015. After Mbonimpa's attack, APDH temporarily suspended its activities due to security concerns. Mbonimpa also claimed that his life was in danger and urged the international community to help ensure his safety.

Since his attack, Mbonimpa has continued to speak out against the Nkurunziza's government and the political unrest in Burundi. He has made international appeals for help to stop the violence and to force the government to call for an inclusive dialogue.In June 2016, he received the Front Line Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk. Mbonimpa has repeatedly denounced the growing violence in Burundi and has asked for international intervention to protect the human rights of Burundian citizens.
