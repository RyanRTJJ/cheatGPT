, according to the UK Heritage Fraud Taskforce, which oversees a project to reduce fraud, many thefts committed by people with links to the traditional industry are going unsolved.

The National Maritime Museum's Maritime Archive is the most comprehensive database on piracy and the maritime industry ever recorded, having been built over the past 40 years.

The documents span about 300 individuals, businesses and organisations, showing how they have been able to profit from international trade over the generations.

"One of the best things about the Maritime Archive is that it's built up the history of the industry in the way it has," James Cook University's Tim Lenton said, who heads the maritime archive.

"It's a fantastic archive on the global maritime trade."

But the data is incomplete. For example, only around 75 cases of piracy have been recorded since the Maritime Archive began.

Another problem: the Maritime Archive documents many incidents which occurred years ago.

The project's focus is on the more recent crimes. And the taskforce's deputy commissioner Richard Murphy says that they are only focusing on crimes such as smuggling, fraud and other forms of waste in the sea that are now serious criminal offences.

Crimes committed when boats are out to sea without a licence are rarely recorded.

"Many of these [crimes] go unnoticed," Prof Lenton says.

Although the taskforce does a little outreach at its headquarters here, some of the criminals' family members are also helping to keep an eye on the heritage of the seas.

A British woman, who is based out of Los Angeles, and a Turkish man, who has his wife in Scotland, work to build and maintain a website that tells the story of the maritime world.

On this website, the man writes: "Our intention was to educate and raise awareness of what the sea means to humanity."

It's a job their young son does too. The man said that their son, at school in England, had
