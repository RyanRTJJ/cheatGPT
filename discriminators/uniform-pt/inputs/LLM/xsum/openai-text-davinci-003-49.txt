 and actor David Tennant to help launch the "Book Buzz" programme in England. The programme is aimed at bringing literacy to young people and encouraging them to enjoy books and reading.

As part of the mission, teachers and librarians will work with Booktrust, a charity that promotes books and reading, to launch the Book Buzz scheme in primary schools. Primary school pupils aged 11 and under will receive a free copy of Walliams and Tennant’s book of short stories to keep and share.

The new mission has plans to reach up to 200 book clubs across England, in libraries, schools and communities, so that the pupils can come together to discuss the books and stories they are reading. The new mission also encouraging parents and carers to join in with the reading, providing them with tips and guides on how to help their children access and enjoy books. 

The mission also hopes to make reading more engaging by launching regular book events across England, which will feature appearances by authors, book-themed entertainment, offers and discounts. 

Mrs Morgan said: “My mission is to give young people the opportunity to discover a love of reading and ignite their imaginations". She hopes that the new mission will have a positive impact on young people's literacy, giving them the opportunity to discover a love of reading whilst helping to improve their understanding of books, stories and the written word.
