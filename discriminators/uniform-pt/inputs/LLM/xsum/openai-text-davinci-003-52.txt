Total sales increased by 2.6% on the same period a year earlier, after accounting for inflation. Sales of non-food items such as clothing, furniture and electricals performed particularly well, increasing by 4%. Food sales have also seen a slight rise of 0.8%, with shoppers buying discretionary items such as ready meals and cakes.

According to Helen Dickinson, chief executive at BRC, the figures show that, “Although worryingly slow during the first quarter of the year, retail spending was bolstered by an Easter boost in April, particularly in sales of non-food items.”

The figures also show that online sales continue to outperform the rest of the market, rising by 11.6%, though this figure is marginally down on the previous month. Despite this, BRC and KPMG suggest that traditional bricks-and-mortar outlets are increasingly taking advantage of the “omni-channel” model of shopping, offering customers the convenience of both online and physical stores.
