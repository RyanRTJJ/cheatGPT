the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, an area of outstanding natural beauty, and the hotel is expected to provide an economic boost to the region by creating around 30 jobs. The plans, which have already been granted outline planning permission, also include the provision of a 70-space car park.

The hotel is expected to bring considerable economic benefits to the area. Aside from creating jobs, it is anticipated that the development will provide extra capacity for tourists, which will strengthen the region’s overall economy. It has also been suggested that its presence will help to broaden the range of accommodation choices in St Davids, which is currently limited in this respect.

The hotel plans have attracted some criticism, with a number of local residents expressing concern about the impact the development may have on air and noise pollution, traffic and the visual amenity of the area. The outlook of the hotel is such that it will not be visible from the coast, and it appears that it has been designed to minimize its impact on the area.

The addition of a Premier Inn to the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park is likely to prove beneficial to the area. It is anticipated that the extra capacity for tourists that it provides will help to revitalize the region’s economy, and the provision of 30 jobs will help to reduce unemployment in the area. The hotel’s design appears to have been tailored to reduce its visible impact on the landscape, and its presence should provide a range of benefits to both local residents and tourists.
