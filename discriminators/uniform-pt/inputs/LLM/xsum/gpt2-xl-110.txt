 disposed of without being registered.

The deaths and expulsions were uncovered by the British medical charity the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) after carrying out an analysis of almost 2,000 infant deaths in London between 1984 and 1995.

It found that the deaths of about 3,400 babies in London between 1990 and 1996 had been registered as unauthorised for reasons ranging from being too small to being born with serious conditions.

The RCPCH said it would work with hospital trusts and social workers to make sure such deaths were recorded properly.

The charity's chief executive, Barbara Stocking, said: "Our data was compiled using the death record system, which, in an imperfect way, gives a comprehensive, accurate understanding of what happened to vulnerable babies. These records must be strengthened.

"The government cannot tolerate the idea that hospitals have conspired to kill tens of thousands of newborns, especially in London."

Ruth Appleby said a local baby-selling agency in her native Newcastle had given a false birth certificate to ease the baby's entry into care in April 1992. "I was told the baby wasn't born so it wouldn't affect anything with the care it was going to get," she said.

"I was so relieved when I saw the child, I couldn't believe it. It was the most beautiful little girl."

A subsequent inquest had found the baby had died shortly after birth of complications including anencephaly, a brain abnormality, in which the brain and skull are unable to form the neural tube in the foetus.

It had also been born with an extremely weak heart. Some experts believe that congenital heart defects are far more prevalent in babies born in the European Union, where birth registration is less strictly enforced.

Ruth and her husband John Appleby, both of whom were born in the UK and have adopted a number of European Union nationals, believe that their baby daughter was given a false birth certificate,
