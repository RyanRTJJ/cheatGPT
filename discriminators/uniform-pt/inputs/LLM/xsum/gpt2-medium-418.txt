 on Wednesdays.

This is the most significant move to date in Chart Show history. The only change to the way the radio station's chart, now exclusively on Radio 1, will be presented is the introduction of a new weekly track by our live band band The Tragically Hip.

Chart Show was only shown on Radio 1 once in the last 10 years and is scheduled for it again soon.

To celebrate the historic change, fans of The Hip will be able to buy a special bundle of three CDs through their Bandcamp account (at the time of writing, The Hip are due to go on tour in support of their new album on November 12) or through iTunes, which feature a live performance by the band.

On the same principle as the first Radio 1 Chart Show special featuring The Hip was made available on Wednesday 12 October, the three new tracks from the new album will also launch in the UK this week.

The Tragically Hip's single 'Havok' (out now on iTunes) will appear over the next 24 hours at the top of iTunes and will be sold through Radio 1 Digital and will have its first UK release on Friday 6 November. The Hip's UK follow-up to 2007's 'Havos' – 'Blast From the Past', released this Thursday 5 December – will be available on Radio 1 before Radio 1 subscribers see the track.

The Hip's 'My Hero', their eighth studio album since 2007, is due in April 2017 via Hype Records.

Radio 1's music program 'Live: The Tragically Hip' will continue the special for the next five days with live performances from 'Blast From the Past','Blast From the Future','Havok', and all three 'My Hero' tracks available through Radio 1. No other songs are currently live on any Radio 1 Radio 1 channel other than 'Radio 1 Live' which features live selections from Radio 1 and Digital Radio 1 channels, as well as the ongoing 'Radio 1 Best of 2014' playlist on the radio
