's the same principle. There's no need to wait. It's just an alternative."

The Scottish Government has not announced if it will take any additional investment, but many of those affected say they would now have to sell if they could not find partners.

They believe the new rules could damage the chances of private businesses buying infrastructure as a whole.

But Labour claims it has acted quickly to protect the economy and help the vulnerable and say the change will make it harder to build the roads Scotland needs.

Labour's deputy leader Grahame Morris MP said this had changed from the days when "every big piece of infrastructure in Scotland would be sold and built in stages and given away as scrap paper".

He added: "By forcing governments to take control of many of these projects the Government of Scotland will continue to let up on spending on our roads and bridges.

"To take more control over what is in everyones house, even more of what is in everyones front lawn, will only encourage road tolls and road closures. More people to put their car on the motorway and on to the cycle path, or to pay up to Â£50 of their income for more fuel, that just has no place in our society."

Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the action by government is an example of how it is losing control over public investment.

He said: "We now have a government that is trying to prevent the investment it needs to create good jobs at a decent wage without any new taxes. Of course, it's clear the real problem is that the Treasury won't invest if it doesn't receive any new money from the coalition.

"I'm not calling for a privatisation of Britain's infrastructure, but this government has turned around and now wants to sell off Scotland's infrastructure.

"As many of the vulnerable people in our society are now facing the risk of homelessness, air pollution, poor working conditions and rising food prices
