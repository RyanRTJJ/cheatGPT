 each other and that's why we decided to part ways," the wife said. The husband added, "We have had good memories together and now we must separate peacefully and bring our life in a different direction."

The couple's romantic story—which began with a chance encounter at a Moscow theatre—had been popularized by the Russian media, which had covered the wedding anniversary ceremonies in 2013.

The announcement of their divorce was met with public sympathy in Russia, as the couple appeared to have the public's best interests at heart. Comments from local news stations included "it's a brave decision" and "it's an example of how long-lasting relationships can end in mutual respect."

The former couple said that although their marriage was coming to an end, they would still remain friends. In the same breath, they both agreed to keep the best interests of their children in mind, and that communication between them would always maintain a cordial tone.
