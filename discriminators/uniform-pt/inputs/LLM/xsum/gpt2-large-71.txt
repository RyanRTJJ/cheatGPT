 Queen Victoria, of all people. As the queen, however, she is not in line to be queen of anything.

Her Majesty the Queen is more or less a state figure, more like a king or queen than Queen Elizabeth as the ruler of the British Empire. She was declared a queen in 2001 for her 90th birthday, which takes her to the 1,250th birthday since her mother ascended the throne in 1952.

And what a century this has been. So far this century England has been united in a monarchical union with three different monarchs–that being Queen Elizabeth, Queen Elizabeth 2 and Queen Elizabeth 3. The fourth, of course, will be the person that ends her reign, that being Prince Charles of Wales. Although people will say so right up to the day of her death–the day in 2016 when Buckingham Palace will be renamed after her.

That means it will be an English monarch that reigns for the next 250 years. It's going to last almost that long, actually.

"We hope that people will be in good humour about this" Hill said after speaking to reporters on the Queen's plane following a Royal Windsor dinner on the South African coast. "We will see. Some people may consider it a little bit odd and it won't be a bad thing at all," Hill said, the Associated Press reported. "But as long as the people vote to leave the European Union and get a good deal, then the Queen has the right to stay on for a while longer."

So she will maintain that title for 250 years? I mean, that's a long time.

It's not like this will change much for the rest of the country. The British are all united in an unholy union until the end of time. The British
