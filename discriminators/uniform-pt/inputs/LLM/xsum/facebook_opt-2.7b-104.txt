atrice is the second-largest city in the region of Abruzzo and is the site of the Amatrice Crolla, where 79 people were killed.

This week's special cartoon features a young girl who is carrying a teddy bear, a familiar toy for Italian children; the girl then places the teddy bear down next to an earthquake damage-marked wall and as she does so she looks at the bear in shock, as if her father has just told her the news.

The caption reads: "We were shocked, but we knew this was to be expected."

This comic comes as rescue teams begin a massive survey of the areas affected by the earthquake, which is one of the most powerful ever recorded on the continent.

The town of Amatrice has not been spared by disasters of this kind in recent years; as the AP reports, "there was at least a third more destruction and damaged in Amatrice than in any other municipality in Italy after a 2009 earthquake killed hundreds and left nearly 70,000 homeless."

Rescued people have shared the despair felt by so many people living in the area. On Twitter, @pierolacina stated that seeing the destruction in Amatrice reminded him of the day his parents died. "I am sure that I was in shock then. It all reminded me of the day my parents died," he wrote.
