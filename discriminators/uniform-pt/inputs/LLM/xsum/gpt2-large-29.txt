 or a timeframe, on the UK's response.

However, one senior trade source said: "I have no doubt that if the UK leaves the EU without a trade deal it would not only lose its position as a major exporter of goods but also face an even worse trade relationship with the rest of the European Union. Even as a small exporter with a relatively weak export potential, from an EU perspective, the loss of those single market freedoms would make very little difference."

Mr Smith and other Brexit backers have warned that no deal would lead to severe damage to the UK's economy. However, even if the UK leaves without a deal, the British Government has said it would still have a "massive trade surplus" with the rest of the EU and many economists – and the Brexit campaign – argue it is already doing well.

Mr Smith wrote in his letter: "The only question remaining is what would the resulting trade and migration framework look like? A single market for goods and services would be in place, but with limited scope for free movement and for the free movement of labour in particular. The UK would also negotiate a trade deal with the EEA. The EU budget and current financial arrangements would remain in place; but EU citizens living and working in the UK would lose access to the current 'free movement' rules if they left the EU."

Mr Smith also said the UK could seek to pursue a trade deal with "most other western countries" which did not offer a "similar arrangement". A series of meetings was due to be held between UK trade negotiators and EU officials at the end of June, but no agreement has yet been reached.

He explained the EU negotiating stance: "I believe we should seek a'soft Brexit;' a period during which all trade benefits but no restrictions are imposed. I believe this is consistent with economic and political reality.
