 and another 300 people remain missing

Brazil's environment ministry has been criticised over the slow response to the collapse of a Samarco iron ore mine in one of the country's biggest environmental disasters.

Authorities did not issue a national alert until seven days after the dam burst and they failed to inform the public that a second, nearby dam owned by Vale had stopped sending out warnings.

As the situation degenerated over the next five to six days, there was a "lack of information, a lack of clear information [and] a lack of clarity of what they were doing", said Luciano Ribeiro de Moraes, a state senator from the state of Minas Gerais.

"That is why so many were shocked yesterday when it showed that in the middle of the night there had been a failure at Vale's dam," he told local newspaper O Estado de Minas. "This isn't good enough. I want to know what went wrong."

The company initially said the incident had destroyed a nearby river and two lakes, but later announced that it had been a temporary failure and there was no damage to local reservoirs. Vale has been blamed for the disaster and on Tuesday admitted to a loss of $2bn (Â£1.5bn) in its third quarter.

However, the collapse of the dam on 23 November has now left 62 million cubic metres of mud spilling into communities in the region, covering everything except the walls of some houses, according to the Civil Protection Agency of Minas Gerais.

As emergency measures began, the company was criticised for lacking coordination between the different emergency response efforts: as it was dealing with the immediate fallout of the dam failure, Vale said it was unable to provide assistance to local authorities.

One week earlier on 16 November, mud hit the town of Mariana, another state, and
