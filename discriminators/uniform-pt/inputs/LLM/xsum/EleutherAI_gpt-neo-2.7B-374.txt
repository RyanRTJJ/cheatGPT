 Taquan Mafi was impressive in defeat, with all three of the South Africans kicking their first-up to a Warriors team who had just beaten the Kangaroos by the same points.

South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus said Taquan Mafi, back in action after the Wallaby summer break, delivered the all-round performance needed to break a Warriors team he felt were too dependent on their key forwards.

Kurtley Haughton and Duane Ver Stegen were on the field for the Warriors, who came back from their narrow loss to the Kangaroos at the MCG by playing their key positions.

"It was a big effort by him and he's back again looking fresher than people thought he would be," Erasmus said.

"He played with a lot of determination which is something we've been working very hard on, and he came to the party on Saturday night where we had to find a way to beat him. It was very hard to do but he made the most of his opportunity to step on the field and do it.

"He's a guy that is a big presence in attack and his run at halfback gave us more direction and also a way back in defence on our end. For us to really do it, we have got to look at it like 'we're not going to play him as a forward and we're not going to make him the best on-field forward player, we're going to make sure he goes down the middle, he is going to get a great off-load and that's our only job."

When he arrived at the Warriors training base in Tauranga a couple of weeks ago with the understanding he would take a two-month break, the South African coach also brought along some new faces. His key men, Kurtley Haughton and Duane Ver Stegen, were not part of his original squad, which includes Tohu Harris, Stephen Donald, Jordan Taufua and Sam Carter.

Having lost the first match of the season to the Kangaroo outfit in Adelaide, the Warriors also made the decision to switch to a new captain - Kurtley Haughton having signed a deal to join Warriors for
