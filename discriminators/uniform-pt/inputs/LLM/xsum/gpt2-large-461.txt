 over Brexit, said it had "decided it was better to move on, as the new strategy will focus on more mature and innovative products". Its chief executive, Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, said the new owners were "very professional, capable and passionate about what they do."

The ENO is one of a small band of Danish companies — the names of which may appear unfamiliar to you — that are thriving in an international climate of uncertainty. A Swedish firm known as Energoatom, which won a tender to build the Paris-based accord's crucial climate-change mechanism, and a Slovak firm that supplied crucial information to the White House to keep the Obama administration in the European Union, were among the winners of a recent deal to buy an existing firm whose name you might recognise: Nestle, which is a massive global food brand sold in more than 130 countries.

While the state-owned company Finkenwerke, which had won a bid to take over a German firm that produced a wind turbine assembly, has found some success, a new generation of Danish entrepreneurs are turning to their peers for help.

The Dutch have been an example. Voorlo, a Dutch group with a number of small Danish businesses that make wind projects, has bought another Swedish firm, Ostergaard, which makes a product meant to help reduce sulphur emissions using "carbon capture and storage" — also known as carbon capture and reuse. And a Dutch consortium has signed a deal to buy Denmark's biggest electrical equipment manufacturer, ABB, in a bid to increase international competitiveness.
