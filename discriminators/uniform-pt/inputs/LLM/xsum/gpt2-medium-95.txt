 said to be at least 65 years old, to be placed on exhibit at Wotine Park.

Wotine Park is under new ownership and was created in 2008, after a lawsuit by the late Andrew Jeter that took many years to resolve. It offers an on-site wildlife sanctuary but is restricted to only five daysa week while the lawsuit is resolved, said the Wotine Park website; visitors are only allowed to see about 25 per year.

"People just don't understand what this seal is doing in the wildlife sanctuary,'' said Todd Ebeling, the foundation's executive director.

The seal lives on the park's shoreline but feeds on sea bass that have been pulled off the lake bottom by humans in the past year or two. The foundation is currently trying to get the seal put into another sanctuary.

The foundation and Kallistos said this was the first time the animal had been seen there. They have been trying to convince park employees and the federal government that the seal should be allowed to live there indefinitely, since the foundation and the government don't agree on what to do with what they sell.

The zoo is "really interested'' in keeping the seal, Ebeling said, adding, "It's great that wildlife people want to do something like that.''

In 2013, the foundation acquired some 533 pieces of sea or estuarine shell and other fin-like parts from a collection of nearly 500 shells collected from more than 200 marine animals, and the shell was shipped out to an aquarium a few miles down the road.

The shell came at a very high price — the shell was going for around $11,000 to $14,000. The foundation and Kallistos said the price was justified because their goal was to protect the animals that would be preserved, and they believed they could accomplish that if they returned the shell to the aquarium for display.

That shell was returned, but no longer suitable for science and display, Kallistos said. While the seal is part of Wotine Park, it cannot see well and cannot swim — neither of those are required for native animals that live outside of their native
