Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said he was aware that law enforcement will be at Thursday's show "in addition to what we expect to see any day."

"Our primary concern is keeping the community safe and our officers safe," he said Monday. "If we're going to get a show, get a show. We'll have a presence and we'll do what we have to do to make sure there's a safe concert for everybody."

The Boulder County Coroner hasn't identified the victims of the July 20 crash.

Boulder-based law firm Loeb & Loeb is representing the five victims — some of whom had been involved in previous criminal cases — in a federal lawsuit against concert promoters AEG and others. That case is scheduled to go to trial Aug. 19, Loeb said.

The Loeb firm also represents the family of Kelly O"Connell, who died in 2016 at the Red Rocks Amphitheater. O"Connell and four other people died during that concert, which had been held annually since 2003.

"These incidents all stemmed from or are related to the Red Rocks event, which we are obviously aware of and deeply regret and saddened by, including the wrongful death," Loeb said.

Loeb also said that his firm will ask the court to move the trial date back, and has been told it could move to 2021.

Loeb said no other firm will represent the victims in the O'Connell case. He would not say how much money will likely be spent on attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the Red Rocks trial.

"We have worked out a compromise with them that it would be fair to get the trial sooner and the costs go down because the people responsible are much better off and the victims and their families would rather have some money and closure as soon as possible," he said.

The Loeb firm was given a partial summary judgment on the liability-related claims regarding the O"Connell death in March.
