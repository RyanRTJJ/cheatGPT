 a member of Canada's 4 x 100-metre relay team, was outgunned by former world champion Asafa Powell.

But Powell, one of the best sprinters in the world, could not equal the dominant performances of Johnson-Thompson.

"It was very disappointing to not do that again," Powell said. "I thought I was going to be able to. It was a very strong show tonight.

"For me to beat Asafa [Powell] in front of that big American team certainly was a good sign."

While Canada had the better of its Olympic final, it was Italy who emerged the victor in the world championships final, while South Africa won their second world title.

It was the first time a single Canadian woman had been world champion since Nancy Greene captained the women's 4 x 100-metre relay team in the early 1980s.

"Nancy has been with me the whole time, but Nancy and I are definitely different now," Johnson-Thompson said. "We've really found our speed."

Johnson-Thompson and Powell competed separately at the world championships, though Powell was expected to be in with a chance of a medal given his strong performance. Johnson-Thompson was in fine form, but this was the first time that the world title is on the line since 1997.

"I can't believe I'm going to be world champion," Johnson-Thompson said. "It's an indescribable feeling. I want to thank all my coaches. And our country. They gave me the training for this."

Named a team captain for the team in the wake of the world championships, Johnson-Thompson was happy to represent her country again.

"My coach, the coaches here at the sport centre, and my family have done everything," she said. "Hopefully we'll be able to go again."

The gold medal was presented by Canada's former Olympic swimming coach Dan McQuade, who resigned after a run of poor performances at world level. "I'd done everything I could," McQuade said of his return to the Olympic podium. "I wish him the best of luck in whatever he does
