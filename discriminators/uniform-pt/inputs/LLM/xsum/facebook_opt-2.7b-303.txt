"Voice recognition" technology was one of the major technological developments announced by Facebook in mid-2014, but the social network insists it's not a replacement for human journalists and editorial teams, or as a means of manipulating the news.

Facebook's research director Andrew Bosworth told journalists: "We want this technology to complement the content you're producing, rather than replace you."

In addition to a "virtual voiceover" tool, Facebook will be rolling out new tools to allow organisations and public groups to "raise, discuss and debate issues affecting them".
