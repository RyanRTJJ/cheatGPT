 accused him of being a key leader of the banned Jamaatud Dawa party and the mastermind behind an attack in Lahore last year that killed a police officer. Now Mr Asghar has been released. He has been placed under a bail bond of Rs 200,000 and banned from leaving the country. He has been taken to a hospital for "precautionary measures", the lawyer of the bail bond company says. A second bail bond company refused bail for Mr Asghar, citing fears that he could be killed by police outside court. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement Mohammad Asghar was arrested on September 21, 2004, in a raid and shootout in the F-9 locality of Lahore. According to the police account, Asghar allegedly led an armed group which entered a government compound. Asghar had fled the country and later returned. Police claimed he tried to shoot them and even brought out a pistol; at one point, they claim he threatened officials and fired at them. But witnesses said Asghar had no gun and was handcuffed when detained. During his detention, Asghar gave police names of those he wanted to be freed and a contact number to contact them, a police official said. But authorities say the names were false. Asghar was initially charged with attempted murder, but that has been reduced in the lower court to attempted murder of police officers and a local militant leader. Asghar was arrested in 2004 in connection to the assassination of a police officer's son. Pakistani security officials say he is the key figure behind the assassination, a charge he denies.
