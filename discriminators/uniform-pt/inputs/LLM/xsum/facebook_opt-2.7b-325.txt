It's a sharp contrast with the government, which last week decided not to publish the names of those responsible for failing to comply with workplace laws.

The union's chief executive, Mark Serwotka, welcomed the government's plan, arguing it is only "the start" of efforts to "get a grip on workplace law breaking".

"Every week we find stories about workers being abused, underpaid, ignored, or threatened with serious and long-term harm because their workplaces don't abide by law," he said.

"It's about time that the government acts on this in earnest and stops turning a blind eye to wrongdoing at work."

The Fair Work Ombudsman's figures showed that in total 3,000 complaints were received this financial year involving employers failing to comply with workplace laws. Of those, 1,927 have been found to be fully remediated.

The Australian Council of Trade Unions will also lobby the federal government to extend the scheme, which requires employers to compensate workers for any unfair termination.

The union last year campaigned against a private member's bill that sought to end the scheme.

Senator Serwotka will meet with prime minister and deputy opposition leader Julie Bishop tomorrow to discuss extending the scheme.

"As the employer-dominated industry is in danger of a power grab, it's only in a time like this when the entire labour movement's united approach can have a real impact that any government will be forced to listen," he said.

A Business Council of Australia spokeswoman said that while the Fair Work campaign is welcome, it is not enough.

"The government has not yet made clear whether it will implement the Fair Work Commission's recommendations for a national integrity test for workplace awards.

"Further action will be required given the alarming and growing amount of work that has to be accomplished with a lack of adequate and effective compliance resources."
