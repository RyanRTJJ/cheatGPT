 to leave his mother's home in Glencoe. He is thought to have gone missing by car on Saturday 5 May and was last seen at her home at 1pm on Sunday 6 May. He is not thought to have family in Scotland or the United Kingdom.

The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has a previous conviction for burglary.

A spokesman for Scottish police said the investigation was being handled by Scotland Yard's Major Investigation Team.

He said: "Police Scotland is in the process of asking an independent consultant to help them establish the initial cause of death and the age and sex of the deceased."

A post-mortem examination could take two to three weeks to complete.

Mr Davies' sister, Sarah, said he had been "very depressed and anxious" after his conviction.

She said: "I'm not sure that you could not imagine how devastated he was."

Mr Davies' mother, Christine Edwards, 51, from Hampshire said she knew he did not kill himself because of his mental illness.

She added: "We have no idea, because I don't wish to spoil things again for him."

Detective Chief Superintendent Michael Stewart, head of the police anti-crime unit, said: "I believe we may now have a firm theory regarding the circumstances of Mr Davies' death and I am appealing to the public to be patient as we continue our efforts to find the young man we all want to find dead but cannot."

He added: "I want to reassure the public that there are lots of people out there who are searching every minute who are looking for the person that we think committed this terrible crime."

A police investigation has been launched to establish Mr Davies' motive but investigators do not believe him to be involved in an incident at any time.

Police have identified a possible suspect who they want to question about the murder of an innocent man who has yet to be identified.

The victim, who is in his early 20s, was attacked and robbed in south London on Sunday
