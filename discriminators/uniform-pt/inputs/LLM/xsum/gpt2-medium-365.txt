 recognizing same-sex marriages performed abroad and setting a minimum age at which gay and lesbian couples must be married to avoid punishment under anti-discrimination laws.

The measure was unanimously approved by Kiwi parliament and faces no opposition.

The vote came two days after the Supreme Court ruled in a case, Gretta v. Minister for Immigration and Communities, that New Zealand's ban on gay marriage violates the rights of same-sex couples. The Supreme Court granted the state another three years to craft its legislation. Gretta had been ordered by the High Court to provide a detailed explanation of how the proposed law discriminates against gay couples on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.

"We do not want to be an environment that is discriminatory towards people who have made a serious commitment in their lives to have a relationship with another human being," Justice Geoffrey Lock made the ruling when he presided Monday's hearing. "Whether they come from different cultural backgrounds or just different points of view, many people hold to a certain idea of who they are in life, a moral stance and a set of moral values." He added that New Zealand had to be open to allowing gay people to wed. "We are not prepared to impose a blanket exclusion on persons simply because they are gay."

In his ruling, Lock said that an individual can make a decision, "for instance, to marry a person of the same sex, who is living with their partner," and that it was the personal choice of that individual person. "There can be occasions when a member of public feels that he or she does think differently from their partner. It is not illegal for that person to make that decision." The justices then gave notice that the ruling would be appealed to the Supreme Court, which in December would hear arguments after New Zealand's federal Supreme Court ruled that the law applied to gay and lesbian couples who had already obtained the necessary legal documents to marry on
