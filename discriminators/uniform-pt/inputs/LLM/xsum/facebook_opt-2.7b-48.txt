, I guess it went back to how it was last week," he remarked. "I was very lucky the course wasn't overly difficult. The greens were just very slow and not really receptive as we've seen on some other courses.

"I hit one of my best iron shots of the day on 16, the green is really good on the left so I wanted to hole the seven iron but it went right. My six footer for eagle on 17 was a bit unlucky I made three pars in a row just before that."

At the halfway point, McIlroy, who carded a 68, leads by three strokes from Lee, a further stroke back from Knox, who birdied the two last holes to give him a 67.

The American, who finished tied for second behind Lee at last week’s Scottish Open, has missed just one cut in 18 events so far in 2009. "I'm in with a chance for a first in 2009," Knox revealed at the halfway stage.

McIlroy, meanwhile, feels that the final two holes are crucial in this event. He commented: "They've not made greens this slow for a reason and it's going to make it really tough to make the move and win the tournament." Lee, currently tied for third on 10 over par, knows how crucial the closing holes are. "If you want to win this tournament, you've got to come in today and take advantage of these final two," he stated.

The last time these two played together, Lee’s three-putt bogey on the 15th handed him the lead, and he was not about to let a similar opportunity slip through his fingers again early on Friday. McIlroy is very much in the hunt for victory, however he admitted that he is still struggling to get into a groove. "I need to make a few birdies around here tomorrow to get back in the hunt," he was quoted as saying
