But other experts were skeptical that much could be achieved with the codes, which they said were merely recommendations and lacked enforcement mechanisms.

The new guidelines — which draw on similar legislation in the European Union — also seek to address concerns about algorithms and political bias in social media. But critics said some of the recommendations were vague and the government’s proposals failed to address some of the biggest issues, such as political interference by tech firms.

The codes are the first major set of rules to emerge from the UK’s year-long investigation into disinformation ahead of Brexit.

Mr. Davies, who has led the government’s response to disinformation campaigns, said there had been a “real groundswell in concern” the internet had become a “siege of lies.” The government said it was taking action because “the public expect us to act.”

Mr. Davies called the platforms’ handling of data an emerging area of responsibility and warned they had to make sure data was used responsibly, especially given new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI).
