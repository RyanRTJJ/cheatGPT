he trees and campaigners said they were "healthy".

The council said it had a duty to remove the trees following a resident's complaint about damaged properties.

Sheffield Tree Action Group (STAG) said the removal was "morally indefensible".

Local residents and councillors have joined STAG in protests since the work began to bring residents' complaints to the attention of the council's contractors.

At one point, the contractor attempted to move one of the trees without securing it properly and the tree fell back onto its original position, STAG said.

Chirs Peace, co-founder of STAG, said: "Throughout the morning we've been submitting written statements, photographs and video footage to the council, in an attempt to explain why the trees should be saved.

"The council's contractor also attempted to move one of the trees without securing it, and the tree tipped back onto its original position. We believe this demonstrates the recklessness of their action".

The council said it had received a complaint over damage to a neighbouring property caused by the trees and it had a "legal duty" to respond to that complaint.

It continued: "Following an independent survey, it was deemed that the trees were causing such damage and needed to be removed."

Local councillors, Matt Goer and Jillian Creasy, have also submitted a formal complaint to the council about the way the tree removal has been undertaken.
