and the Welsh language organization Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg, who have since noted an improvement in bilingual services, with some councils taking bold steps and taking a fully bilingual approach to their services.

In addition to improving bilingual services, the introduction of the Welsh Language Standards has seen an increase in the number of Welsh speaking local government employees, and an overall increase in the use of the Welsh language. A 2019 report by the Welsh Language Commissioner found that 31 councils across Wales were fully implementing the standards, compared to just 13 in the previous year. The Commissioner has also held local authority performance reviews and awarded "points of excellence" to councils that exceed what is required by the Standards.

The Welsh Government has also put in place plans to promote and expand the use of Welsh in the public sector. These include launching the Welsh Medium Pathways programme, which aims to equip public sector staff with the Welsh Language skills and resources needed for bilingual working, and launching the Welsh Language Technology Strategy, which will aim to develop innovative language technology products to make services more accessible in Welsh. The Welsh Government has also established the Welsh Language Commissioner, whose role includes reviewing the level of Welsh language provision in the public sector.
