, about half of those taking part are not politicians, he added.

Mr Davies told BBC Radio Wales: "The idea was to do something more informal after the Commons has finished for the day and just to come here on the bike for the last weekend.

"It was very much about raising the profile of cycling and more people should be cycling for transport.

"We asked and we were very surprised to find out that most of the politicians had not been able to take part.

"We are looking into that, the event organisers may have been given incorrect advice."

Last year's Velothon took place in Ballymena and only one of the 30 local councillors took part.

He said many councillors had told him they wanted to take part but the event organisers suggested those who wish to take part have to be "featured".

The Velothon's organiser, David Davies said the event is a "very successful event" and its aims to ensure that the Welsh Assembly building is "not the only venue in Cardiff to host an event".

However, he told BBC Wales that he wants to see political leaders take part in future events.

He said: "I think there is a danger that politicians may look upon Velothon as part of their political role and it may become a lot more expensive for them to take part.

"The only politicians that took to the streets of Dublin last year were people who are on council tax, not MPs.

"I've spoken to the MP involved and he doesn't feel he is at a disadvantage because he was not able to take part."

But Mr Davies added that he believed the event is helping Welsh Assembly politicians.

He said: "I think Velothon is helping the Welsh Assembly more than it is the Welsh MPs.

"There will be more MPs interested in cycling and if it helps them I think that's a good thing."

The Velothon's first edition in Ireland saw about 7,000 people take part in Dublin and Mr Davies added that
