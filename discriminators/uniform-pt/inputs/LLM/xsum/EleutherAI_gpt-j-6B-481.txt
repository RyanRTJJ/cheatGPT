. The poll this time is being closely watched amid concerns of a repeat, as both candidates seek to extend their winning momentum and consolidate their claims of legitimacy before the November 27 presidential runoff. Neither side has conceded defeat since results were announced Sunday evening. The count is still taking place in contested areas, and officials have said there is room to alter results. Both camps blame each other for the delays.

In an earlier statement, Boubacar Keita, a spokesman for incumbent president Fran√ßois "Comrade" Toure, accused rival Moussa Faki of being "the true accomplice of the attackers," describing him as "the one responsible in the entire country for the death and injuries of innocent citizens."

"It must be clear that he is the one behind the killings of innocent citizens," Keita also said.

In his televised speech, Faki denied the accusations, accusing him of making "false statements" he'd committed a crime.

The two men are set to run against each other on May 26, but opinion polls see Toure winning with most of the votes, leading to a run-off on June 27 between him and Faki.

"I do not see it as part of my responsibility to participate in the kind of violence (that has) characterized the past few days... I will not run under these conditions," said Faki.

The first round of balloting on February 18 was marked by a wave of violence. More than 50 people have been killed in some areas in the five days leading up to the vote, according to the UN's refugee agency.
