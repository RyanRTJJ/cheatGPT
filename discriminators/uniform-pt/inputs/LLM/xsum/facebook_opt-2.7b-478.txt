 as “heavy” although there were no major incidents.

On a lighter note, a fan sang “The Dolly Dub” for the first time outside a ground for 21 years – but missed the line “The Dolly Dub’s on the way”.

The song is a tribute to an Edinburgh fan who travelled from her native Glasgow to watch Celtic beat Dundee United at Hampden in 1993 and died of a heart condition the following day.

The Scottish Football Association has confirmed the song would not be allowed at the next match at Hampden.

"The song, the video, and all the aspects associated with it will not be permitted in The Park," reads a statement on the SFA’s website, "and the Scottish FA will issue a strong statement when all the facts are known of what happened last night."

The match began at around 19.00 BST and was played under floodlights because of an early morning downpour.

The first half ended scoreless after Arsenal keeper Manuel Almunia came up with a series of superb saves from Aberdeen striker Kenny McLean.

The two Glasgow sides went close before Celtic took the lead when Scott Brown poked home from a corner. Two minutes later, Scott Sinclair doubled Celtic’s advantage.

The Aberdeen supporters had been given free tickets for the match after Celtic beat them 2-0 in the final at Hampden on 11 April.

The Tartan Army were quick to come out in force on the road leading from the station towards the stadium, but a heavy police presence kept the two sets of fans apart by half-time.

It was a tense wait ahead of the second half when the away fans began gathering.

Despite the absence of the Tartan Army there was a sea of red in support of Celtic and they were soon chanting “Baa oir!”.

There were some flare-ups on the fan section which led to Celtic fans being ordered away.
