With all the media hype and general public attention on the current debate in the Netherlands over public service cuts, it’s easy to forget the less familiar but equally important part to the mental health care system in a country like ours.

The Netherlands has some of the most restrictive mental health laws in Europe–even by comparison to our sister EU country Switzerland. There are very few treatment choices for people with psychosis. There are no medication options available.

Many patients are left with suicidal thoughts and unable to commit to therapy sessions after multiple failed attempts at getting treatment. A large part of their time is spent in the legal asylum system waiting for a new home. They then end up in a mental health care institution for life, despite the fact that most of them suffer from untreated psychosis and have no idea how to change that.

And even after you’ve spent many years in this system, you may have been told by doctors or treatment professionals who can’t prescribe medication or haven’t even had the time to examine their mental state–or can’t tell us exactly what they’ve observed! After all this time in a legal system (often with their own legal advocate) you may have the impression you’re in the wrong country altogether. This of course
