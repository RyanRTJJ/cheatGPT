 public contracts to local authorities in England and Wales would be withdrawn, Madge said, while all services would be cut by 30% by September 2007.

"I am announcing that, after consultation with staff, children and residents, we will be reducing the size from seven to five nurseries and children's centres across the town," he said.

Madge also said the council's children's centre at Beeston would be closed. The council had been criticised in recent years for funding that centre - known as the Beacon centre - which receives government grants to offer childcare to disadvantaged children in the area, with many residents opposed to the move. A meeting scheduled to be chaired by the centre manager would be cancelled. Beeston has been the subject of planning protests for several years.

In a statement, a spokesman for a Beeston residents' association said: "These cuts will result in loss of jobs, a major drop in services, and a substantial increase in residential area costs."

A council spokesman said: "The Beacon centre has been an income stream for over 10 years. It receives money from the council and a private partner, which is why we have not closed it."

A spokeswoman for the Beacon centre said she had received a "substantial increase" in fees, and would consider any implications for its future and "talk to all our residents about what the future is."

She said: "To make best use of our resources we're always consulting with our residents, and if it looks like our services are no longer being able to support the community, we open discussions on how to do things in a different manner, to make best use of the resources we have."

'Profit'

Labour councillor John Mckenzie said council bosses had been "pursuing profiteering over a long period of time, without any consideration of the consequences on our residents."

"The people of Beeston - the majority of whom are on the dole - are being asked to pay more for services they don't use,"
