 a night shift, while men and women who work shifts may benefit from lightening or rotating night shifts.

“This study shows that you should never consider working a night shift or rotating night/weekend shifts as an option to prevent breast cancer,” said lead author Kristi Stacey of Brown University.

Stacey and colleagues used data on more than 35,000 women with breast cancer enrolled in a randomized clinical trial sponsored by the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. The clinical trial was halted after investigators found that shift workers had a 34 percent higher risk for cancer than others.

The researchers found that women who worked 12 or more hours a night who had ever had a breast biopsy — a standard test for breast cancer — were 10 to 15 times more likely to have a positive test. Women who worked 12 or more hours were also more than twice as likely to say that they planned to have a breast biopsy within the next five years, according to the report.

Although shift work is not as common as it used to be, especially for women, the risk is still present, the study found.

“Our research team was very impressed with the power of the study and will use this and related data in our efforts to prevent breast cancer,” Stacey said. “I firmly believe in the power of research and that it’s up to every person to play a role in improving the community at large.”

The study appears online July 24 in The Journal of Clinical Oncology.
