 have already been the subject of a consultation period. The plans announced in October would create a new body to oversee and promote the protection of the built heritage, viewing and visiting heritage sites, curating and collecting heritage, education and training programmes, and research and policy development.

The proposed body would bring together some of the functions of Cadw, which is the Welsh Government’s historic environment service, and the National Museum Wales, which includes seven national museums. It would have a unified budget and be non-departmental public body, accountable to the Welsh Government. In an updated statement on the announcement, ministers said such a body would "help create a joined-up approach to the Welsh Government’s work on heritage, while giving it an independent voice and presence."

The statement continued that Historic Wales would still be accountable to the Welsh Government, and that all personnel, powers, duties and policies currently in place in both the NMW and Cadw would be “fully transferrable" to Historic Wales. It added that Historic Wales would have a "wide focus," "ultimately ensuring the heritage of Wales is better protected and made more accessible and engaging for visitors."
