The study found that over a year only 5.4% of people with severe obesity, defined as a BMI of 35 or over, lost 10% or more of their weight. BMI is the measure of weight relative to height.

The study further concluded that no more than 10.9% of people with severe obesity shed even 5% of their weight.

Researchers noted that current weight loss guidance for people with severe obesity relies mainly on behavioural change, but often fails to help them attain long-term weight loss.

Lead researcher Dr Keith Abrams commented: “Most people who are trying to lose weight find it very difficult and depending on the context, weight loss success or failure is complex and variable.

"These findings suggest we need to develop new and better strategies and treatments”. 

It is crucial that better treatments are developed as obesity is linked to numerous adverse health outcomes and imposes a substantial burden on healthcare systems. The UK government is considering introducing a 20% tax on sugary drinks to tackle rising obesity levels.
 
The study further found that even very small amounts of weight loss could lead to improved health outcomes. Patients in the 5-10% weight loss group had the most improved health relating to cholesterol level and diabetes, suggesting that there could be benefits in aiming for even more modest changes in weight.

However, the researchers cautioned that many very obese people cannot lose enough weight to bring about major health changes within a year, and treatments must be tailored to help people make achievable goals and meet them.
