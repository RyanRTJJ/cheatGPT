In a statement, Crystal Palace said: "Wilfried Zaha has tonight handed in a transfer request and as a result, the club are working with the player to resolve the situation before the transfer window closes.

Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha has handed in a transfer request

"The forward has informed us that we can expect a transfer request from Zaha before Monday's 11pm deadline for domestic transfers and the 4pm deadline for all league transfers.

"Wilfried is contracted to the club until the summer of 2023 and will be a much-valued member of the squad going forward. I would like to thank Wilfried for his contribution in the short time he has been with us and I will be speaking with him this week to find a way forward over what we believe is a very positive and successful future for all concerned."

Zaha's form this season has been a key factor in Palace's resurgence under Roy Hodgson, with the Africa Cup of Nations star scoring 14 Premier League goals and winning the Premier League Player of the Month award last month.

The Ivorian will be available for England's Nations League game against Spain on Thursday, which they will need to win to claim third place in the tournament, which would book a place next summer's rearranged European Championship.

Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha

Zaha's contract is up at the end of the season and Hodgson is looking to tie the forward down to a new deal until 2025 after he publicly made it clear he did not want to remain at Selhurst Park.

A deal looks increasingly likely, but it remains to be seen whether Zaha will play on in his current position due to the club having signed Christian Benteke on Sunday from Liverpool for Â£32m.

The former Everton midfielder will likely move into Zaha's spot as a central forward as the Eagles play their home games at Selhurst Park.

Zaha and Benteke had one more league goal last season, with the Belgian scoring nine Premier League goals in his 32 appearances.
