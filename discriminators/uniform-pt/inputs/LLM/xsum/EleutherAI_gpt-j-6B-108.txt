 will install the telescope’s sunshade over a three-year period on July 31. The first attempt was aborted last month in Florida when Hurricane Issac blew off the protective film. This is the fourth time since 1994 that scientists have mounted the sunshade to protect Webb from the Sun.

“It has been a bit of a long fight,” said Charles Bolden, NASA’s shuttle program manager, in Washington Monday, following the successful installation. “It took us a long time to go to space, and then to bring the James Webb back. Now the sunshade that protects the telescope is ready for flight.”

By late August, James Webb is expected to be rolled into its final location aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery during a five-hour, 3.5-million-mile flight around Earth. There, an eight-person crew will strap down the telescope’s 18.5-ton, 21-foot frame, remove a series of protective covers and install the sunshade, which is designed to withstand the intense heat of Webb’s target area in space. The heat shield will act as an insulation layer for Webb while also shielding it from the Sun.

“After a decade of planning, NASA finally gets to flight,” said Stephen Larson, the NASA space telescope scientist who will ride inside Discovery and remotely operate Webb on the journey around Earth.

“Webb is the most important astronomical science instrument ever launched, as well as a national treasure,” said George Diller, an astronomer at the Smithsonian Institution and a former Webb deputy project scientist. “For all we do to celebrate and safeguard America’s past, this observatory really represents the future.”

Diller said the Webb telescope’s successor will be able to image much more than its predecessor, which has captured images of the first baby stars, planets and galaxies in the newborn Universe. Webb’s successor “is going to be spectacular,” Diller said. “Its discoveries will be far and wide,” he said. “We will see where most of the stars in the Universe formed — if their chemical makeup reflects the star’s environment
