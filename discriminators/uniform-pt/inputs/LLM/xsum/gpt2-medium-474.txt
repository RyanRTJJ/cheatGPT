There were fears that her health was deteriorating once again, with doctors suggesting that she should be moved to a rehabilitation unit in London where she could better recover. A spokeswoman for Kensington and Chelsea Council confirmed that the development had been approved and plans are being reviewed to take place by next week.

In 2010, the then Conservative government made the decision to extend their stately residential towers by another 20 storeys without giving any explanation for this move. David Cameron and then culture secretary David Jones described the towers as "spectacularly expensive" but said "people will like it because it makes you feel at home".

Cameron announced the decision to extend the Royal Oak at Kensington and Chelsea just before Christmas 2001, on holiday with family and friends.

The new tower is among those owned by the company from which Boris Johnson bought the development in 2010.

The developers were given planning permission in March 2012 by the council for their new tower, and on 24 October gave residents the green light to move into the complex by 3 January next year.

The developer then appealed against the decision to the supreme court, arguing that the council had not given sufficient consideration to alternative uses for the project.

At the time, the Supreme Court ruled there were six and a half times as many social housing properties for rent in London.

Speaking about the decision on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Tuesday, Cafferkey did not take a definitive stance about whether she was ready to move out until she was more "relaxed" and ready for a new start. She added that, even if she does decide to leave the homes, it is still a "disgusting feeling".

She said: "People will say I am getting old, it doesn't make sense. I am a huge woman with a family, and I am surrounded by people who love me, I like them all. It feels, very much, like a trap. But it is not."

Her mother added to the anger felt by those opposed to her moving, claiming on Sunday that the authorities were ignoring a letter from Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, promising to "keep London" cool during Donald Trump's trip there.
