 many members of the public had been drawn into visiting the exhibition because the show had inspired them to think about the possibility of virtual reality, while also prompting them to think about the relationship between art and technology "You're constantly immersed in someone else's experience." She said although she would like to have a gallery showcase the virtual paintings of the exhibition before it opens in October, with the virtual nature of the show, the virtual installation is "a way of engaging with these issues of power, culture and identity." She added: "It's certainly possible to imagine these experiences as part of another artist's process. "But they are the experience of a particular work, a certain context of work from which they're brought in." The gallery will introduce the VR installation to the public on October 7, in time for an exhibition run from November 6-11 and a live show from October 14 – November 2. The exhibition is curated by the British Museum, supported by the British Visual Arts Council, which also runs the Tate Modern, under £7 million a year and is a recipient of the British Library Arts Research Foundation's research grant "Investigating the Future" – the first of its kind to use VR in art. London-based artist and musician Chris Taylor has teamed up with British VR pioneer Jono Båken, whose work was recently nominated for the Lister Prize for new cultural works. Taylor told The New Yorker he thought that people might be able to use VR as a means of becoming immersed in the experience of museums - it's "the perfect canvas for that." "It seems like everybody I talk to for the past six or seven months - who's been invited by museums to have virtual experiences - is very surprised by how immersive it is," said Taylor. "I have asked people to share pictures that they've taken in museums like [the Museum of Modern Art],"
