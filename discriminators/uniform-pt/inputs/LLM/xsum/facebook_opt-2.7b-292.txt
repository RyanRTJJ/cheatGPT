 as an alternative to prison in some New York counties. The city of New York is spending $18 million to increase the effectiveness of restorative justice, which could mean the courts consider the severity of an offender's crime based not on the defendant's record alone, but how the crime has affected the victim.

Restorative justice, which began in the 1960s, teaches offenders to be better people by understanding their actions, trying to understand their victim, and apologizing for the harm they have caused. It started out as a means to keep perpetrators out of prison but is now used across North America. In 2004, it was legalized in the state of New York. The state Supreme Court issued a rule that Restorative Justice must be taught to all attorneys at law. Today, there are more than 700,000 students participating in restorative justice programs in at least 15 school districts in the state, including New York City.

Most of the programs in which students participate are in response to discipline issues. They require everyone involved in the dispute to take responsibility for the outcome. Some schools use restorative justice in the following manners:

Violence is handled using a mediation process so that every single student is heard. If they come to an agreement, other students can hear about it too. In a non-violent dispute, students find ways to make up and resolve the problem themselves; for repeat offenders, that might mean a meeting with a family member, or a community service project.

Sexuality Education is integrated with the restorative justice program. Students who may be at risk have a chance to talk to a therapist, and they learn how to be safe when engaging in sexual activity.

Dangerous Weapons like Guns, Knife, and Bombs are handled using what is called "Alternate Delinquent Confinement." It is different than traditional probation. Instead of making an offender wear an electronic ankle bracelet, offenders are locked inside their cells for a period of time, and then
