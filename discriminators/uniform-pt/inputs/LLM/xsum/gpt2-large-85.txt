Mr Roberts was struck with so much force his leg ended up on the floor, he said. 'He had come close to stabbing me but the gun went off. I went to grab for it but he pulled back,' he said. 'The gun shot me and I was shot. It went into my leg. He got about five inches off me right in the leg, then it went up. 'I said nothing, I just stayed still to the last second and that is when they started shooting. When he shot me, I just fell to the floor. I was shot in the thigh.'
