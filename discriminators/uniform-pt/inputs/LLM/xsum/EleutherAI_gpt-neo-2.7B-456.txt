 by taking 14 for 49. On 24, they faced one over left to win a wicket and needed 20 with the last ball to claim a fifth bonus point. Instead they declared with 24 overs remaining, meaning they would only need 23 from eight balls later. So what were some of the positives to take from this day?

For me it all revolves around what I’m calling the “three-strike-run” pattern; the fact that when they scored all six wickets, they had four left with which to bowl. On day one that was quite important, as it helped open up the crease and give the bowlers a chance to make the ball swing. This was also important on day three as now they could bat aggressively and the batsmen would open the crease, which was ideal with five wickets left.

The good news is the team now seems pretty good, though of course the next 10 games are not going to be kind to them. It’s going to be fascinating to see if the team comes back together, as it’s clear one of the two problems in this side seems to be the bowling. They now have the freedom to swing the ball a lot, not just when it’s in to them, but also to swing when chasing them. If the other side’s spinners are good enough to change the pace on the ball around mid wicket, then here is another reason why they will strike.

The batsmen were getting better this morning. We have seen a big improvement in the batting with Rizwan Butt going past 25 in his first 10 overs and now there is no surprise in where this form is taking him. Both of our off spinners are back from injury and looking like they may return to action later in the year. We will have to wait and see how these three play out, but it gives us a lot of confidence going into the
