 boss Harry Redknapp said of the Â£50m asking price, "My heart goes out to everybody involved in the club and myself."

England internationals Yann Mumm and David Ginola, 20, are also due to join at half-back.

Newman manager Eddie Howe told a press conference after Middlesbrough's defeat at West Brom on Friday: "They took over this stadium and we did things over there last time.

"We know we want to win on Sunday and we are playing at the new Emirates stadium tonight.

"There's a little bit of a learning curve but in our experience this is a very good, good football club so hopefully there's no surprises and the fans deserve it."

The Magpies opened the scoring with the second goal on 79 minutes.

But Jordon Ibe's side could still hold on to the league title and go into top spot in the West Stand.

Tottenham manager Hugo Lloris said: "The fans really love this win."

Stoke boss Sam Allardyce claimed that all signs were pointing towards a draw from his first-team side.

"I think there's so many good things to come and we will win at least," he said on Sky Sports Radio 5 live.

"People want to talk about how the fans are celebrating but if they get a draw then it's always going to be a very good game.

"It's a good week for the manager and then he starts the next half and everything will go to plan."

And if they lose on Saturday, Chelsea fans will be looking more forward to that day's competition.

"This is the best game this season when we are playing one of the best teams in the League. It will see a great victory for us."

Stoke boss Rafael Benitez added: "The supporters will be looking forward to everything and hope that we get in a game really soon."
