 by Sir Philip at the Bournemouth Apollo Centre which includes the 'Manned Space Flight Facility/Space Systems Development'.

Sir Philip's company plans to build on this for the next 100 years but with a view to putting the Space Shuttle back into service.

When asked what had led to the £6m investment Mr McBride said, "It is all done with the right people and the right scale at the right time which has been particularly challenging with the ageing space agency, the UK Space Agency where we are. It is an enormous challenge.

"A number of companies have been brought back forward into the picture with a great deal of expertise and commitment to the job, including Lockheed Martin, which has brought in the experts from the commercial space sector, SpaceX which has brought in its team to do the design work.

"Together with Rolls-Royce you will see very strong progress taking place over the next couple of decades. In fact there are very positive trends and we believe this trend will continue beyond the end of the Sixties before something major happens as the whole space industry looks up towards the future. Hopefully we'll see the Shuttle return to service in the coming 50 years or so."

The original plan was that the Shuttle would be launched into space from Cape Canaveral to bring the first astronauts to the Moon. This was due to happen in the year 2000.

Sir Philip announced during the announcement of the £200 million of investment in Space Systems at the Apollo centre in Bournemouth that he has an "awesome plan" but that it will not be possible that the Shuttle is landed at Kennedy or that a crew is able to land at Hanoi or even that astronauts will be able to return as they went back into space.

He said: "If we do not go beyond those two goals, then we are finished. It is really exciting to be a part of that because there are great people on the team and we have some great technology.

"All the systems, all the vehicle that we have envisaged will be within one-third of the cost to bring them home. That is a fantastic prospect and I'd like to congratulate the engineers who
