 she was handed over at the agreed date and location.

A senior police officer said: "Natalie was detained for not having the correct consular paperwork and her case was assessed within the law.

"Natalie was not arrested. She was detained to assess her travel status and a decision was taken to return her to the UK."

The MP for Glasgow Southside has been critical of the SNP government's proposals and wrote to Nicola Sturgeon in October to express disappointment over the UK government's proposals.

Ms McGarry wrote: "We all want to leave Europe and move away from the EU as quickly as possible. However, we must not jeopardise the United Kingdom.

"I am not opposed to a deal that brings an end to austerity, improves public services and allows us to prosper as one country.

"But if this is a negotiation to remove the European Court of Justice in return for no customs arrangement, then this could cause a major problem".

In September, Ms McGarry expressed concern about Scotland's future when it comes to being outside the EU.

She told BBC Scotland she could "live with" a future Scotland only being tied to EEA membership - a trade agreement between the EU and the European Economic Area.

But she said she could not "live with" a UK-EU trade deal that would remove protections for workers' rights, environmental protection, consumer rights and workers' rights.

She added that there "must be an opt-out" for Scotland to maintain its protections.

The SNP had warned last month that Ms McGarry would be placed on a register for international travellers.

Ms McGarry told the BBC this was an attempt by the Tories to intimidate her and that the SNP administration does not intend to "chase people out of the country.

"I've got a responsibility to stand up for the people of Glasgow Southside and Scotland... They need me".
