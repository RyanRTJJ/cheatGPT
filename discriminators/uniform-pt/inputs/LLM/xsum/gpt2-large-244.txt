"So in Welsh politics, and for Wales' future, a question of whether we stay in Europe or leave it must be decided by a referendum," she will say.

As for what that might look like, Cameron will suggest that Brexit-supporting parties should "engage in talks with European and Commonwealth entities and the EU to find a way forward together."

A Tory source close to the prime minister said Cameron's vision amounted to "wishful thinking and a red-line and it's not what Labour is offering."

"It needs to be a question of who is most likely to be in office at the next election in 2019 but also someone that people across the UK feel able to put their confidence in."

He added: "The focus of the entire party should be on getting the people of Wales a voice and getting out of the European Union.

"No minister should be able to say the British people must not understand what they have just voted to do."

A spokesman for the SNP accused the Tories of seeking a "credibility gap", saying: "We are a small party and Labour can continue to bully us.

"The Tories now seek to use Scotland as a bargaining chip, promising to veto Tory MPs on Holyrood votes, but only if they agree to the EU's terms of membership. And just because they have a majority, that doesn't mean there can be no limits to their power."

A spokesman for the Welsh Conservative group said the party remained an "alliance of four governments with the same principles" and could not support Tory proposals.

He added: "We are not seeking a deal on EU membership as such. We want a free trade agreement that benefits both our businesses and our industries in Wales, and the rest of the UK.

"However, if it were to be made clear there exists an alternative offer which the Tory government has made to the devolved government, we would immediately consider all our options, but the Welsh Conservatives would not go along with those policies as this would have a damaging economic impact."
