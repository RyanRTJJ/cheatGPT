-based business has declined in every year since the tax changes were agreed for the new tax year. The loss makes it the UK’s fifth-largest food processor with turnover of £1.1bn in 2014.

Cargill said the new tax legislation would result in the “greatest impact” on businesses like its own. The FCA had been informed in advance of its decision to raise its guidance for tax payments this year, the British company said.

Meadowside Food Group director, John Hines, said: “These are challenging circumstances, with increasing economic uncertainty. We believe that our robust business model and strong financial position will continue to deliver value to our shareholders.”

Other major producers that have warned of the impact of higher taxes, including Walkers, Biscuit King and Premier Foods, did not give any details of the impact on their results.

The FCA first increased the tax threshold last year from £85,000 to £90,000 and then to £95,000. The changes were in force for the April to June tax year, with the level of payments due being confirmed for each of the two following years, the first on 1 July 2015 and the second later this year.

The FCA has warned before Christmas that a “sharp rise” in tax payments would occur. A previous £4 billion increase in the threshold was not sufficient to prevent an increase in revenue for HM Revenue & Customs, according to the FCA at the time.

The higher threshold will increase the average tax bill, however, because smaller earners are liable for a lower proportion of their earnings. The tax on incomes over £150,000 will be capped at 37.5% but the FCA expects the “greater majority” of payments to hit 32.5%.

On top of the threshold, and of new charges being added in 2016, there are extra costs imposed by the government’s controversial National Insurance changes and the introduction of a minimum wage.
