 Keegan, led to a second-half winner, and although the home side had already seen a previous one turned away they couldn't get a more damaging moment to take control - Mills' ball over the line in a last-ditch chance from the edge of the area.


Mills has had an average career that has been a struggle on and off the field, having played at Tranmere, Newcastle, Derby, Blackburn, Bristol City & Cardiff City.


"I don't have a bad experience here. There is only one goal in seven games. It's not a bad place to be but this season has been a hard time and they've won two games they should have won and there are no excuses about it as far as I'm concerned."


With a new management in the Championship and promotion confirmed next weekend, Mills isn't looking at any different sides for Sunderland's home games against Coventry City and Huddersfield.


"It won't be difficult to handle. We're going in with a positive attitude and we have to learn how to handle big clubs such as Coventry."


There were strong feelings at Wembley towards the end of the season, with Norwich City coming away at Sunderland with a 2-1 victory at the Stadium of Light.


While Mills insists he was "proud" of his team's efforts, there was a sense the club could have done more to win the game with the last opportunity at the end.


"I'll be honest, we could have been a little bit better. We let the team down but we've been trying to win games and we're not getting enough points. Coventry are a big club and we are really, really far from qualifying for Europe."


There were some great scoring chances going the other way in the game, but the most threatening for Sunderland was when Tom Ince sent a low shot off the post - he'll join Blackburn manager Ian Holloway as a Sunderland player on loan for the rest of the campaign.
