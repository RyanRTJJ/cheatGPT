 damage.

The vessel sank off the Scottish coast on Sunday but the cause was not yet known.

The ship sank from underwater oil droplets hitting the water and then the ship's hull.

The oil did not reach the surface. It went straight to the bottom, where the oil droplets were broken off. The oil will take time to decompose and take off carbonised into particles a mile deep.

The oil found that evening washed up on the islands.

A spokesman for the Department of Conservation said: "After the oil was dumped overboard, birds landed on the islands.

"It is likely that it will take us some time to process these pieces by hand so we cannot say for sure when the oil will wash ashore.

"Crowds have been on the island for years at the end of this whale feast and we expect some more oil to be found floating around as these are not from a recent whale spill."

It is thought that bird deaths are common in an oil spill because the birds cannot swim very far and the droplets will keep floating down for some time.

The most recent whale-furene, on 26 January 2012, wiped out nearly 700 birds on the Isle of Skye.

In 2010 six tonnes of oil were dumped onto the Isle of Man's coastline when the fishing port became a landfill. But the oil did not affect the birds, and the department said that this was the second largest mass oil spill in the UK marine industry.

In September 2007 the BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, killing 11 rig workers.
