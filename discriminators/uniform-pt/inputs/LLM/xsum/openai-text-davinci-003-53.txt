 for pushing up property prices in popular cities.

The firm said the focus of overseas investors had shifted, largely away from London to other parts of the country. Investors are now more likely to be buying high-value homes in areas that are popular with older people or retirees such as the Mediterranean, Spain or Portugal.

The findings suggest overseas investors are no longer driving up property prices, with prices even on properties with foreign owners falling in some areas compared with two years ago.

The research was based on an analysis of almost 90,000 properties.It said that between 2011 and 2016 the number of properties owned by people from outside the UK had increased by just 1% to 5%.

In London and the South East, the number of foreign-owned homes fell by 8%, although there was a 74% increase in London neighbourhoods such as Westminster, Kensington & Chelsea. In Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the number of foreign-owned homes rose by almost a fifth.

The data also suggested investors from Russia, India and China were now driving more overseas investment in the UK, with a 63% increase in properties owned by people from Russia, a 114% increase from India and 43% from China.

Overall, the report found that overseas buyers made up 11% of all sales in the same period. That figure had dropped from 12% in 2010.
