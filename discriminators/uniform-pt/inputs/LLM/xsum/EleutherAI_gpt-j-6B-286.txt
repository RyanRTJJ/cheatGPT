Bristol City Council has confirmed that the cost of emergency journeys provided by private vehicles and taxi-cabs to schools in its area will also be under scrutiny when officials gather on Wednesday to discuss the issue.

The council was forced to ask a judge to suspend charges for failing to make sure a number of school buses, and their drivers, arrived at their assigned pick up point when a child was killed by a rogue bus in 2010.

A spokesperson said: 'There will be a specific meeting with staff to be carried out to assess which vehicles are currently being utilised to provide emergency journeys to schools, as well as vehicles already in service.

'In addition, council drivers will be interviewed to assess whether they feel they can safely operate a vehicle that has been tasked to provide emergency vehicles, at all times, as per the current policy.

'If a need for a review does arise, the council will put forward any necessary proposals for change.'

Meanwhile, Bristol University has started a pilot scheme which will see private cars, buses and taxis providing alternative emergency journeys to youngsters travelling to and from two of the city's schools.

The free service, to be introduced at Filton College and South Bristol High, will operate within walking distance of the schools

The new move has been designed to take the pressure off schools during the summer holidays.

It is already being piloted by three schools from across the city, where teenagers have reported it has meant they miss less school days and miss fewer journeys when they take the bus.

Julie Smith, headteacher at South Bristol High, said: ‘This new initiative will make a difference to our students and it’s important that a safe and robust system is in place.

‘While emergency driving is often necessary, our students are young, active and don’t always need an emergency bus – they simply need to access the same level of service, just as any other child does.’

Last week, police confirmed that they are no closer to solving the mystery surrounding the'mystery driver' behind the fatal collision.
