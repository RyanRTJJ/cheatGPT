How can you tell if you have the genes that put you at higher risk of Alzheimer's?

To find out, the researchers compared blood samples from 12 people with Alzheimer's to 12 without. They tested the participants' memory, judgment, and executive abilities because these skills are affected by the disease.

The first nine genetic variants that they identified, or risk genes for Alzheimer's, appear to confer a 3% to 25% risk of developing the disease. They also found that nine out of 10 of the risk genes are linked to Alzheimer's in one family, so there is a strong genetic "mother-to-daughter" transmission of the disease.

After they found the genes, the researchers ran genetic analyses on Alzheimer's gene mutations found in patients. They analyzed people with high-risk gene variants to see if someone has inherited the disease from a parent. (In the last few years, many people have found genes that they believe might be associated with Alzheimer's.) They also identified one type of protein that may be altered in Alzheimer's, which suggests that the disease alters its own proteins too.

Then, using data from the NIH.AARP (the American Association of Retired Persons) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), they found that people with genes that raise their risk of Alzheimer's by 10% or more had greater difficulty performing everyday activities as their mental abilities deteriorated later in life.

The researchers also found that people with higher levels of risk genes experienced longer life spans than healthy people. The results were adjusted for several factors, including family history, education, and occupational level. The increased risk of Alzheimer's does not appear to be due to a particular brain region affected: Alzheimer's research has shown that people who have Alzheimer's in one part of the brain are unlikely to develop the disease throughout the brain.

How did the researchers interpret the results?

The researchers concluded that they needed to do more study of the role of risk genes in the development of Alzheimer's. They plan to follow patients for 10 years to understand any relationship between the risk genes and the disease.

Conclusion

Researchers have learned more about Alzheimer's over the past few yearsâ€”but we still don't know why it
