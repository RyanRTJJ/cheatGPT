 forces are deployed around the capital.

The government said Friday it was "unacceptable" that there had been attacks across Paris on November 13th that killed 129 people, despite the fact authorities said two lone attackers and one suicide bomber were also known to have fought on the streets.

"This is simply unacceptable," the interior minister, Jan Jambon, said.

Another interior interior minister, Jan Cliche, told national radio the attacks were "an indication of the continuing threat of extremism and terrorist cells", who were "reeling from the terrorist attacks" in Paris.

A British foreign office spokesman tweeted that the incident had "shaken [EU] and the world... deeply".

Belgium's National Post says it has seen intelligence that "several persons who fled the site were killed during a clash with police", and that local police in the city of Schaerbeek are investigating the attack.

Police in the south-eastern town of Molenbeek had earlier said one suspect had been arrested in connection with the attack, but that all remaining suspects have been captured.

They also stressed the state of emergency was temporary, not being lifted until all attacks in the continent remain under investigation.

Authorities did confirm that five people had died from burns after they got caught in flames while trying to flee Brussels after a van ploughed its way through crowds celebrating the November 13th holiday.
