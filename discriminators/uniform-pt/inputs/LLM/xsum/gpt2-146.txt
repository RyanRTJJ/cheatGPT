Hamilton, who took part in the Formula 1 Grand Prix on Friday, admitted he was disappointed he did not end up behind Hamilton.

"I think I was the leader of the race. I have got to go up the podium," he told Sky Sports.

"I don't like to lose points and now I am only three points behind the best in the best. That was a big goal but for me anyway it was the right decision."

Hamilton said: "I thought after qualifying it should have been more technical. For Nico, I just had my heart set on not losing to him.

"I have not really given him an opportunity."

Hamilton's Mercedes team-mate Daniel Ricciardo has joined Hamilton for McLaren in August after they failed to secure championship rights at the end of the season following their success last year together.

The Spanish champion took part in the last lap of McLaren's second race at Estoril in Hungary - ahead of Mercedes and the Ferrari duo.

"A big race for me is on a day when I can actually go with Ferrari," he said. "If you can run like you can when race day comes I guess that will be nice.

"That is how this is right now and I am trying to put myself back into shape.

"For me having the Mercedes is good racing to be happy and it is good driving so it will be good in a very nice mood on race day."

He also said the fact he has taken part in the race against the reigning world champion, who has won four consecutive races, indicated he was at peace in the team.

"I am actually happy about a team-mate saying I am really comfortable racing for everybody that I have not touched," he said.

"It means you can talk with everyone about how the results were and do not expect anything and to do this team-mate who has just taken all his stuff, to have a great time
