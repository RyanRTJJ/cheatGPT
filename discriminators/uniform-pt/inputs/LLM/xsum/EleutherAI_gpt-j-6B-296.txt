 spokeswoman for the Department said it was "confident all sections of the union movement will vote with the government". "It's imperative the bill goes through on Tuesday to ensure workers are protected and that any union members who may be victims are given access to civil proceedings," she said.

The union movement is due to hold national conferences over the next few years in anticipation of the bill becoming law. In 2011, a bill passed by the former Tory-led government of David Cameron which would introduce a cap on public sector pay. The move sparked a 16-day strike, the biggest ever in Scottish public sector history. It also led to an amendment to the Trade Unions Bill which means it cannot be introduced into the Scottish parliament.


What are they proposing? The most controversial feature of last year's Trade Union Bill is the introduction of pay caps on public sector pay awards. Under the bill, the cap would stop pay increases for public sector staff once a figure of 2.5 per cent is reached. This is compared with the cap on public sector pay in England of 1.7 per cent.

This means the average public sector worker in Scotland would see their pay cut from more than £26,000 to around £11,000. This is on top of the £9,000 they will lose under the Scottish government's budget plans for 2014/15 of which the cap on public sector pay is just one part. The legislation means a new pay board will be set up which will be chaired by the First Minister and will be chaired by an employer representative. But Ms Swinson believes that this is not enough. "No doubt many public sector workers are satisfied with the current pay and conditions in their union - but neither is enough on their own. They need their government to step forward," she said.

The Bill will also make it easier for the government to sack trade union officials which could stop them in their tracks. And civil servants will be allowed to strike as unions that
