The protests in Zimbabwe have been one of a number of mass mobilisations organised by activists outside Zimbabwe to call for an end to sanctions imposed on the country by the US and the EU for its alleged human rights violations and election fraud.

The main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), accused the ruling Zanu-PF party of using the country's economy to quell dissent in the country by stifling dissent through "massive state-sponsored arrests and intimidation of activists".

The Zimbabweans in South Africa-based Zimbabwe Association of People of African Descent (ZAPAD) in a statement accused the Zanu-PF of using the economic crisis to "perp walk activists who dare to oppose the party, thus giving the impression that the party is in power by default".

The group said the Zanu-PF leadership "cannot afford to lose legitimacy or legitimacy does not come even from elections". They said ZAPAD strongly condemned the arrests of five activists.

"This is what opposition politics and opposition supporters mean by repression," the group said.

Al Jazeera's Alex Richardson, reporting on the same demonstration in Harare, said the organisers had anticipated the possibility of police arresting their members and in fact gave several of them "obtrusive body-surveillance" devices to protect them.

The organisers said the devices were intended to monitor how many were being detained and where and for how long.

They accused the police of treating them "like animals" and trying to discredit the organisation.

"If you have seen Zimbabwe politics, it is not something you like to be a part of. You can be arrested on a whim," said one of the organisers, Gift Nyakuhara.

'Possibly the highest death toll from violent political unrest in Africa'

In an interview with Al Jazeera following the protest, Nelson Chamisa, another leader of the MDC party, said there would be "even bigger demonstrations" if President Mnangagwa did not call a special constitutional assembly.

"This is a peaceful movement. There will be no use of violence," said Chamisa.
