 Hamilton's pace.

Kimi Raikkonen had to retire on his return from a spin and Raikkonen's Ferrari, with team-mate Alonso, was 0.142secs down in fourth place.

Vettel, who qualified on pole for the second and final Grand Prix of the season at Barcelona in June, improved his fastest lap to 0.939secs over Hamilton after he stopped for new tyres around the Parc Eifileo on Friday morning after a high-speed collision.

Vettel admitted he may take the time to rest for the Japanese GP on Sunday or take it a stage today to ensure he is fresh for Sunday.

With the race starting a couple of minutes ahead of the final qualifying session, Lewis Hamilton's time was delayed until the start.

"As you probably now, the red line is still set by me, and it will stay with me until we cross it here. I think I can really help the team to be quick in this race with the race pace, which is a little bit difficult today," he said.

"I will try to do something a little bit different than normal to get the best lap, I will think it is my best lap that I can get to this race.

"We need to be as quick in the pits as possible for our whole race, even if I go out on the long run to do something extra.

"It will be better if I decide it now and be quick like this at the beginning. My race will be on a Sunday like this."

Raikkonen lost three places in the process to the Ferrari of the Finn, who qualified on pole.

The third Mercedes was fourth-placed Alonso, with the second Mercedes of Britain's Lewis Hamilton fifth.

Vettel's teammate Kevin Magnussen made up 0.565secs in sixth place on the combined.
