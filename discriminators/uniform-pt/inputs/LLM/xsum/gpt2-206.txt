 employ automated computers to take deposits in advance of deposit being withdrawn, and to an additional five,000 allegations of breach of trust by Commonwealth Bank.

"The Commonwealth Bank was in the process of completing the acquisition of the IDMs and these were not operational, according to the inquiry report released on Friday. The Commonwealth Bank did not operate, and therefore was not in a position to do any business with us," he said.

"I don't think it will take an attack on the bank over its management, management practices and operations to make such big damage.

"This is not about the Bank of Australia's operations; it is about the integrity of this important institution and the integrity of Australian democracy."

The government was also asked to respond to an inquiry into whether the Commonwealth Bank could have been a partner to the G5 and G6 countries in their internal affairs. The government said it was examining these allegations and an inquiry is under way by the Treasury Office into Australia's offshore and bank relationships.

The government's statement said:

"We have identified five incidents that are not under investigation. Based on these five, there is no potential for the government to intervene in any of the investigation."

"Given the concerns around Australia's reputation and how it is being portrayed in media by the Australian Government, the government is urgently assessing the matter. The government also needs to be open and transparent to the public about the integrity and integrity of the government's offshore activities."

Greens MP and former Commonwealth Bank CEO Brian Lenihan said the move by the government was "absolutely abhorrent".

"This is not going to have the desired effect, I don't think it will make a dent in Australia's confidence in the democracy of other countries, it will give the very few people on this planet the chance to govern, what I'd call democracy," he said.

"The people who don't like a democratic system are going to be able to get themselves their heads around it.
