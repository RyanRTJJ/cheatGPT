Around 90% of journeys are made in Wales. The vast majority of journeys make it across the country without taking the bus (60%) or a train, the report says. "The number of journeys in Wales has increased year-on-year by nearly a third", said David Evans, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Association.

He said ambulance accidents were on the rise, with drivers getting a four-fold increase in compensation to people caught in between ambulance trips.

More than one in five of those caught could not be discharged despite a 50 per cent rise in ambulance service.

There has been some dramatic increase in hospital accidents, with hospital staff reporting a 22cm rise in hospital admissions (and one of the highest on record).

This is important because it is a direct and fundamental part of the NHS's economic success.

increased levels of care expenditure for ambulance service and provision in the private sector, as well as the impact on ambulances.
