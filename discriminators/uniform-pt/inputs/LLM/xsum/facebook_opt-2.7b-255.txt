ink was hacked to death on Christmas Eve 2011. A court in Amsterdam found her guilty of "negligence", but the judge ruled that the prosecution had "failed to prove that the defendant knew that the mental health authorities lacked sufficient knowledge of Mr Ensink's mental health state". The Dutch broadcaster NRC called the ruling "a triumph of the right".

Ensink-Teich is also the mother of Marc Ensink, who was abducted in the US by a foreign terrorist organisation in 1986 while still a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Ms Ensink is awaiting the outcome of a judicial review of her conviction.

Ensink-Teich's son told Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant that the verdict was "incredible".

NRC columnist Jan Tille called the verdict "the biggest disaster for the victims of terrorism in history".

The NRC reports that judges "could only point to a lack of co-ordination between the police, the prosecution service and the council responsible for enforcing the mental health law, and that the defendant herself did not know to whose account she should report". This, he argued, was "a very significant factor that is so seldom considered by both the public prosecutor and the defence".

On Friday, an NGO called the Collective Against Fear of Terrorism said that it would launch the first case against Ms Ensink-Teich for "terrorism".

The court found that Dr Ensink called 112 on Christmas Eve 2011 "after having read in newspaper reports that the killer was free to kill". One of the nurses assigned to follow up the call reported that Ensink-Teich "did not seem concerned about the man's state, but said he could commit another murder".

In his ruling, the judge criticised government moves towards "austerity" as being a factor which contributed to the mental health services' shortage of money and staff.

However, it criticised the lack of awareness of the services' shortcomings as another huge factor.
