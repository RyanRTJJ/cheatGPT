 are those against prejudice: racism, sexism, discrimination and poverty.

The order has been in the forefront of the fight against these issues. For example, it was the founder of the world-famous ‘Pink Lady’ march and was the first international peace activist movement when it formed in 1910.

In the words of the order’s leader, Margravine Margarete “This is why we work all around the world to help people overcome their prejudices,” the pope said during the ordination ceremony in the Vatican library.

The pope also recognised the importance of education and noted the importance of the order in the fight against social ills worldwide. He cited the example of a young man who committed suicide in the middle east, while attending high school, because he could not face discrimination and persecution due to his religious beliefs.

The ceremony was dedicated to the 200th anniversary of the foundation of the order’s foundation at the University of Vienna in Austria.

Since the ceremony is not open to the media, a Vatican spokesman did not give details of the ceremony. “Please contact us to find out more about the event,” he wrote.

The Vatican said in a press release this week that both the Order of Malta and the Order of the Garter are “in the service of humanity”, and that those who serve in them “in the name of their sovereigns” are “ready to assume a mission of the highest moral value”.

As of April 2013, there were 5,056 members and officers of the Order of St John. As of 2009, members of the order had committed 7,250 hours of service, through which they had helped more than 400 communities in 37 countries.

Since its first foundation on 14 April 1405, under King Frederick I of Hungary, the order has become the oldest and most important European religious Order of Charity.
