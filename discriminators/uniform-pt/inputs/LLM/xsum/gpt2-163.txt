 the BBC ran last night in Wales where a Labour MP, Ian Murray, asked his MPs to 'do something to get rid of Brexit'. The answer is no more.

The fact is, Brexit will cause a major demographic shift away from the Conservatives and Leave campaign. That is the reality that has not been seen since the days of William Morris, when the Tories were led through Britain by a small group of "independent Tory MPs" with a small but well-documented record.

The evidence is overwhelming that the public, as a whole, is deeply divided in favour of Remain. This is what happened in Spain over the summer, when an amazing number of Spaniards sent their representatives there, without any political representation. This is what happened when the European Union was created by the Spanish government. This is what happened as the 'free trade' referendum took place. With Brexit approaching, it's likely that voters will not remember.

If we believe that the UK has a choice in the next couple of weeks, let's see that the electorate of Wales, and the whole world, will see that they have the power to decide. Let's believe their voters. Let's believe that all the people with a voice can say to the European Union:

"Leave the European Union."

It's not about winning, it's about winning on the ground. Those who support Remain should know better.

I'll be honest now – I don't particularly like Brexit. I'd rather spend my days watching Boris Johnson speak and read about Europe then leave the Brexit lobby for good – at least as far as my political life is concerned. But it has nothing to do with my political work in the UK, what I do is look for opportunities. Brexit is not about winning. It's about making Britain great again.

That's why it is important for Wales to hold a referendum.

It's good times, right?

After all, the fact that this referendum is being held on a so-called "safe" paper of a majority of voters makes it virtually impossible for our political parties to change.

For example that is a very real possibility.

If the government does not propose a deal, in my opinion Brexit could
