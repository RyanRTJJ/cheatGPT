ained Wynn. Investigations later showed that Allsop had used a disproportionate amount of force against Wynn and that Allsop’s actions had breached guidelines set out by the Association of Chief Police Officers.

The incident sparked a national outcry and an investigation was launched by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). This concluded that Allsop had used “disproportionate and unnecessary force” against Wynn and that racial stereotyping and discrimination may have played a factor.

The IPCC found that Allsop’s actions were a potential breach of police standards and referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The CPS then charged Allsop with common assault and he pleaded guilty. Allsop was fined£2,000 and given a 12-month community order at Coventry Magistrates Court in March 2012.

This incident caused great public concern about the use of excessive force by the police and their ability to exercise balanced and proportionate judgement. It also highlighted the need for police officers and policing in general to be more accountable and transparent. 

In the aftermath of the case, the investigation led to changes in police practice, such as greater awareness of the use of proportionate force and increased training in respect of cultural diversity. It was also hoped that the case would serve as a reminder that forces must adhere to proper standards of discipline and conduct, so as to protect individuals’ rights and prevent further instances of police misconduct.
