After years as the main tourist attraction, Times Square has now become something of a cultural battleground over pedestrians and their rights to be left alone.

The Times Square Society has been fighting the proposal for almost a decade against a proposal that would have forced the theatre district to sell the city property they had been renting for nearly a century.

The costumed performers now roam freely in Manhattan's busy Times Square, the heart of the theatre district. The council is mulling rules for pedestrian plazas after receiving complaints from businesses that they are too big and intimidating for people.

The Times Square Society is trying to force the city to sell the land where the New York Times Company ran the Times Square theatre. This is where the famous M-G-M buildings once stood. The group's spokesman, Jim Fichter, said there used to be 5,000 people in the street every day, and now the square is full every day. He said the Times Square Society is fighting for the health, safety and security of their clients.

Jim Fichter said the Times Square Society and other groups are fighting "for their safety and the health, safety and security of our clients."

"If we can't be assured that the public can get back to Times Square and we have to sell the land that's been used by Times Square for over 100 years that is our responsibility," he said.

"But if the city can sell the land I don't feel right about it. And if the city can't sell the land I'm not going to sit idly by and allow it to continue to turn into a liability over this long run."

"Times Square should be left as a neighborhood. Not all of it, but it should be left alone. They can't take it away from Times Square," John Ettorre, president of
