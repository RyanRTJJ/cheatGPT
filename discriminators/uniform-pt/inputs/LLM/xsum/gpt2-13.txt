 the Department of Electrical Engineering and Applied Sciences of Salford University, from the University of York, UK and his colleagues were studying the use of high speed transmitters in small grids which use optical fibers to transmit information using high speed optical transmissions. These systems are called 'N-GIGs' which are highly connected and allow for the transmission of information between stations. They are very efficient at providing such an integrated network over a large number of channels and low latency. The researchers say a higher speed transmission would not need to be used but it could still take a certain amount of time to connect to other networks. Another way would be to use a high level of parallel transmission of the data being transmitted over the inter-node links to create a high bandwidth link which would allow for lower latency. Another approach is to use the inter-node link so all of the nodes can communicate directly and on-site. The findings of the study point to the possibility that as the cost of these high speed networks increases, many more will be able to be used to communicate and relay data to others in more cost effective use and that other nodes will also be able to be used in more efficient modes. The researchers from RGC 1404's team analysed images captured from RGC 1408.1 and saw that they could send data from the GBR, TFF, MPR and EGP nodes, but also the HPC node at 5.4km from the edge of the network, as shown in figure 18.2.

Figure 18.2: The RGC 1404 system uses inter-node links. This is more efficient for high-speed transmitters, which can provide high bandwidth links from all nodes. The high speed links would need to be as high as five times the speed of the inter-node link on the MPR, then, of course that would require a large amount of inter-node connections over the inter nodes.

However, this study also shows that there are still significant technical limitations. The low bandwidth connection requires only a large
