atroopers attacked a town in south-east Sussex amid rising tensions with the Dutch.

A new book has been written by the group which has led the prosecution on one count of murdering eight women and children. One was found on an apartment block. Two died in the street.


The book is likely to be given worldwide treatment, attracting more than 400,000 views across six languages. Critics of the group are calling for an investigation

One of the women said: 'They were victims from our school, we came to Londonderry to mark the sixth anniversary of the publication of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry report. Thirteen people were shot dead on 30 January 1972 when British paratroopers attacked a town in south-east Sussex amid rising tensions with the Dutch. It is too early to judge whether the murders were deliberate. But we will soon have a sense of who exactly she was, why she led such a savage and bloody campaign, how she was attacked, what she did, and what they were at. It is important to remind that many of these murders were committed by white nationalists'.

Thirteen women and children, including nine children aged one, five, eight, six and five, were found in the streets of the town after a mob, the Leveson Report said.

Two men, aged 19 and 25, each died in the attack, and one female was later found to have died after she came to terms with the trauma of the events which went on for years. Other victims were not able to talk and were buried.

Police said they were investigating the possibility that a man could have come into contact with the women while attempting to enter the town to 'kill or injure', but had yet to secure a motive.
