 to the club "for the benefit of all [shareholding] creditors rather than to benefit the creditors in a preferential or unjust manner".

In November 1928, two football managers, former Sheffield United and Chelsea defender Jack Crawford and former Wrexham, West Bromwich, and Stoke City forward John Nisbeth took over the team. Crawford and "Bomber" Bob Booth moved to a newly purchased stand at Kennington Oval, with Crawford as assistant manager. The South Australian public were told "there is no more than a fortnight remaining in football's season".

Tribunal of Arbitration 
South Australia appealed the Tribunal of Arbitration, the Court of Arbitration for Sport, against the decision to refuse entry to the Northern Territory, Victoria, and South Australia in October 1926; and after hearing had dismissed all appeals to the Court of Cassation and the New Zealand Supreme Court. The appeal ruled that the clubs must receive the same treatment as the other teams in the Northern Territory, and South Australia, with exception to "playing matches upon the original terms of admission." However, the original decision would have to stand, and the clubs could have an appeal to the Court of Cassation, but not to the Supreme Court.

Crawford and Booth were appointed the South Australian club's second-team coaches after the dismissal of the previous coach, the former Newcastle, and England international Frank O'Farrell, who was dismissed after the end of the 1925 season. The two coaches had played together for the first time in South Australia in 1926 in a game against North Adelaide and also had the first meeting of the year on the same night when they arrived in Adelaide. The club's season ended in a draw against North Adelaide.

Following on the advice of the South Australian team selection committee, which felt that the Adelaide "A" team was "the most fit to play against Melbourne," the club's "A" team was forced to train in Melbourne against West Torrens and Melton. They were given a 15-man squad, as they were considered more of a Victorian-based team than a South Australian one.
