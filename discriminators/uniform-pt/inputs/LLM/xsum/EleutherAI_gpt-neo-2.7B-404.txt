 an altitude of 100 metres.

The order placed was not to install a new drone in Cambridge to complete the delivery, as the drone itself did not weigh any more than 2.5kgs and was more than likely still able to travel the 400-kilometre journey over the next few days thanks to the electric motor.

Instead, the package order was to have a drone deliver a second package from Cambridge to the recipient’s home.

All in all, the average flight time was 45 minutes, with the fastest delivery time achieved between 9am and 9pm on the Friday. The delivery would take place between 9am and 9pm on a Saturday.

The video also shows the cost of the package delivery, which is expected to have an annual return to Cambridge on the order of £20. The annual return rate on the £4,950 cost of the drone and 2kgs of Amazon FBA products is more than likely to be £400.

The packages will be delivered twice to ensure the recipient can enjoy their new product without interruption in the meantime. Amazon and Cambridge University have worked with the drone company Firefly Drones, which provided the electric drone, to ensure that the drone remains in full working condition throughout its journey to the recipient’s house. In fact, Cambridge University purchased one of their own drones to deliver the package and has paid for its maintenance. As such, Cambridge University pays for both the drone and the materials required to build and maintain the drone, which will give time to repair the package.

The package was purchased from Amazon FBA at the same time as the order, so the two services are working in conjunction to ensure the fastest possible delivery time.

The drone will be back at Cambridge University’s premises on the Wednesday. It will be in full working condition again when it arrives, and therefore, it will be safe enough to fly again.

The drone’s battery will also be re-charged when it is re-assembled at Cambridge University, as the drone carries a weight
