Paginated-Cultural Sites

The Church of Ireland is part of a global network of archaeological sites in South and West Africa, primarily sites found within central and eastern Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, where they exist for centuries.


The site area used by the church includes 1,200 sites and 15 hectares under a National Trust land scheme - both of which include major structures found here.

Museums in the park are listed as heritage sites for several thousand years - some found here as early as the 11st century.


The archaeological research of the two major archaeological sites included in Desertmartin is also part of the archaeological diversity of the site range.

The Church of Ireland is also a UNESCO World Heritage site, and is part of the network of sites in this area.

The Church of Ireland will also host a National Archaeological Education and Education Centres (NAPER) program to educate people about sites of ancient significance.
