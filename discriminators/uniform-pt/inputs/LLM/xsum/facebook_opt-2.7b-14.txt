 want to work in London again and have not been offered other routes – effectively, their wages have been withheld.

Deliveroo says these riders “may be better off” on another job and that “some riders have been offered additional working hours to accommodate their reduced demand for riders”.

However, a spokesperson for Deliveroo said: “We would urge anyone feeling they feel unsafe to report a crime to the police and we are concerned that the number of incidents may not be accurately reflected for riders who are not working in London.”

“This week, we’ve been sharing more statistics with riders, including incidents recorded by police. We’re also continuing to work with police, relevant authorities and the delivery industry body the Delivery Hero Group to tackle violence.”

Deliveroo says it has not had any incidents of violence reported in Dublin, but this could be because their riders are not as at risk.

Ride-hailing app Uber, whose delivery service Uber Eats is available in over 650 Irish shops, has seen a 35 per cent drop in revenue over the past three months.

Uber has been criticised for being lax and for having unsafe driver’s, and despite promises of changes to driver conditions, riders, activists and politicians continue to agitate.

At the time of reporting, Uber had no comment to make on the rise in reports of violence against Deliveroo riders.

Correction 22:05, 21 August 2018: An earlier version of this article implied that Deliveroo has stopped its operations in Great Britain. This was incorrect, just as our headline misled readers that the report comes from Ireland. In both instances we should have used more clear language.
