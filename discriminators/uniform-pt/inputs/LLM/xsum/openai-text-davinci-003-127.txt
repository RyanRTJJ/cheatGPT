 Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and that the UK Government had acted unlawfully.

Privacy International accused the UK Government of carrying out “bulk interception of internet communications” and “collection of vast amounts of data held by communications service providers”, in violation of Articles 8 and 10 of the ECHR, which concern privacy and freedom of expression. In response, the UK Government argued that it had measures in place to protect citizens' privacy and that their activities (or certain elements) were authorised by law.

The court ruled that GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 did not have the legal authorisation or basis to undertake bulk interception and the collection of vast amounts of data. Aggregated data retained by communications service providers should be classifiable and accessible to the state. The court also ruled that while some data collection was necessary and proportionate, there were deficiencies in the way the data was collected and retained. Furthermore, the court found that bulk interception resulted in a “significant failure” by the UK Government to comply with its obligations under Articles 8 and 10 of the ECHR. 

In response to the ruling, Privacy International said in a statement: “For over a decade the public has been kept in the dark about the practices of the UK intelligence agencies. For much of that time, these practices have been tested in secret with no meaningful oversight from the courts. Today’s ruling brings this to an end.” The ruling is now expected to have implications for how security services in the UK and Europe operate in the future.
