ures home glory.


Second-placed Ulster were unlucky by comparison, winning just four corners all weekend but making just 38 tackles, with the gap to second-placed Glasgow reduced to six points.

After a spirited start, Irish side Munster were in control from the start to the first whistle but were undone by a sloppy handling decision, while the Lions were unable to convert a string of penalty tries.

Reds coach John Connolly had claimed victory all week through the Ulster forwards in their attempts to outfox the Lions, rather than make up the difference on the ground. He is, however, left scratching his head over his side's lack of success thus far.

"They're not good enough on the ground," he said after kicking three kicks in the first half but acknowledged mistakes had been made too often. "We haven't got enough quality in the midfield and it looked to me like our passing game wasn't working. We've got to come out and say there needs to be a step change."

The Lions had scored points of over 40 against Ireland but were down a man at half-time before Paul O'Donovan was red-carded late on after tripping and being shown a straight red.

This wasn't a good look away from Stadio Olimpico as the Lions looked like going into the break with a 7-0 lead, but the hosts found that with much less threat on a cold pitch, before Riddell took advantage to score with two minutes remaining and cut the deficit to four points at the break.

The Lions then went on a fine run of form after that, when their opening two tries by Boyd Tinnie all came in successive periods in the run-in. Conor Murray, Luke Fitzgerald and George North extended the lead with excellent tackles and crosses before the home side opened the scoring within eight minutes.

But the visitors couldn't get past Scott Lawson in a match as much of a disappointment as they have been under the new regime, and this was a huge miss
