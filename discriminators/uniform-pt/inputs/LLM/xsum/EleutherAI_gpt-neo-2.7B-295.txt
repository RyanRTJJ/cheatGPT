,600 tyres purchased and replaced. The bales are a higher pressure and more robust specification. This is essential to reduce the risk of damage occurring.

“We believe Sport NI took the right decisions in investing the money in an area where it was vital for rugby to have that investment,” said Chief Executive Mike Boyle.

“The NW200 bales are in line with our current bale specification and our aim for the future is to continue to invest in the bale specification. This is something that the RFU has said they will continue to invest in for the future with our bale specification increasing over the course of next year. We have a very committed team in place to continue with this investment to deliver better performance over the course of this year and beyond.”

“I would like to pay tribute to Sport NI for their tire and bale investment in the RFU, which resulted in the NW200 bringing in more than 120 new bales in the new season and the new tire investments delivering more than 1,300 new bales,” Boyle continued.

“Sport NI have also helped us to better align the bale specifications in line with club needs in 2016, and it is extremely exciting to see the improvements that the NW200 has brought to rugby this season through increased use of the ball.”

Founded in 1984, Sport NI – formerly The Scottish Sport and Recreation Association – has worked with clubs at grassroots level and, through its bale and tire investment in the region, has made a significant impact on rugby. It has worked closely with clubs to make the biggest difference in the delivery of rugby and the wider sporting landscape in Scotland and across the UK.

The RFU has been investing significant funds into its ground improvements program, including at Murrayfield over the last 12 months, as part of plans to deliver a new standard in terms of standard for the standard of our home pitch. The NW200, like its predecessor, is a key part of this.
