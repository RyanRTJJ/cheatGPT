'Our only hope of making the tournament is to do well at home in the Six Nations. If we can make it, it's on us. In terms of our preparations we feel very confident.'

The Scarlets were a surprise package on Tuesday, although they did not have an answer for the Blues to their attacking threat.

But in the opening 15 minutes the Scarlets showed a different side to their traditional game away from home, exploiting Wales' tactical frailties with ease at the scrum and in areas of the field outside the breakdown.

They were punished by the Blues, who were penalised for holding on to the ball too long while in the scrums in the first half, and were forced to fight their way into the game with a late attack with six points.

'The game was very close between us in the first 15 minutes and we had to play more attacking ball,' said Jones.

'It's important for us to show in the second half that we are more defensive, we have more power in our tackles and we are a better defensive team in the second half.'

Liam Williams scored two tries and a late penalty in Cardiff, while Sam Jones made his Six Nations debut as a replacement from Olly Cracknell.

Rory Best was in the squad, but Wales could only salvage a one-sixth victory over Connacht.

'I'd like to think we would have taken two points from them in the second half but just as with the first half we just made too much of a difference,' said Scarlets coach Mike Haley.

'Connacht are a better side than we were in the first half but we didn't handle their attack well and didn't create space as well in the first half.

'They had more strength on the outside in certain areas, they were good on the line, on loose ball inside the 18-yard box and inside the tackle.'
