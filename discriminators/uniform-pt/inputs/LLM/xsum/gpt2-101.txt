 England.

The former England skipper conceded that England were "doomed of a good batting order" and asked the commentators to consider "what we could have done differently". They replied that it could cost them on the half-hour.

The visitors were soon put away a bit longer and, it emerged, were still getting their pace through and at a slightly shortened venue, too late.

The home side were just three wickets short of their double-century mark of 11 over the final 20 overs, while the visitors did only one to 10 runs for the first time in the morning and they have won five of their last six Tests and been promoted, in fact, in a three-day Test.

England were still holding on to the match and England captain Sam Allardyce, though asked to explain the decision, responded: "I don't know, it was a matter of time before we decided on that.

"We wanted England over for England, it was a good day. But what to do? It was quite clear that we had lost the game. It is just the pace, we are just running at it."

Allardyce went on: "We can't get there early. One can't believe we missed them and it was a very tough day but we felt very lucky.

"[It was a] first Test, just for England, it is a first Test, for sure. It is a good day by us, we can do some good things. Obviously, we have just got something to prove. We have to make some great runs up the order."

The captain for Chelmsford, Charlie McGrath, is in line to play out his first England international. He arrived in England in June after eight years in the Test side. He played his first international match for Northampton in January 2011, when he was dismissed in round four by South Africa for the same conduct and was subsequently sent off for five matches in the Champions League second
