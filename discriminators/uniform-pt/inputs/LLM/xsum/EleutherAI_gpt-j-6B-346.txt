 they remain within three points of leaders Liverpool.

However, Chelsea will be without Brazilian midfielder Oscar and Colombian defender David Luiz, out due to a thigh and groin respectively.

Lopetegui's team, who drew 0-0 with Tottenham last time out and were beaten in the corresponding fixture, welcome Bournemouth to Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

That match sees Mourinho face his former club Old Trafford, when the Red Devils welcome Liverpool to the club's home on Sunday.

Both teams look set to meet in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, with the fifth-round match billed at the neutral Emirates Stadium.

The sides last met in 2012 in the semi-final, with Jose's current side edging Manchester United on penalties after a thrilling 2-2 draw.

But United manager Louis van Gaal, who replaced Mourinho between 2011 and 2013, reckons the Portuguese should be back in charge by the middle of the month.

"When I met Jose, he told me that he was returning to be part of the team until the end of the season," said Van Gaal earlier this week.

"I don't think it's an obligation for me to say that, because Jose is free in that sense and free to do what he needs.

"It's absolutely normal, he has an obligation in the same way I have the same obligation towards my players that I work with.

"It's good that he's doing his job in the Premier League and he's doing it in a nice way. I think he deserves this respect."

Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, meanwhile, has described "dealing with Jose" as "the best gift" in the "worst Christmas season".

The former Dortmund coach, who had no choice but to play for Mourinho's Chelsea against United in 2013, admitted the Premier League title race was "far from over".

The reigning champions are five points clear of second-placed Tottenham and six points ahead of third-placed Manchester City, who lost 2-1 away at West Ham on Saturday.

Klopp believes title rivals Liverpool - who were on course to retain their crown for the first time since 1990 - are still capable of catching leaders City in the title
