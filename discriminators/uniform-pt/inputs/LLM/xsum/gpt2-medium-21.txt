 recommends a daily physical activity level of 20 minutes for most adults.

However, the group was less than half that recommended by the Australian National High School, where 71% participated in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week.

Australia's schools still ranked just ahead at 43%, with almost 2,000 pupils in the country receiving higher level physical education courses.

However, more than half of those surveyed identified as'very active' (65%), compared with just 15% who described themselves as'somewhat active' (23%).

The study, conducted by the University of New South Wales and conducted with the Wellcome Trust, said that people who did not have sufficient physical activity could have an increased risk of death within a year. It also found that the amount spent on exercise would almost double in the decade after the average adult's exercise session had stopped.

The global study, based on data from more than 100 countries, found that the WHO recommends no more than 250 minutes of active physical activity an hour. This was compared with an average daily participation by Americans at 45 minutes.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that adults should be at least 150 minutes of active physical activity a week, with less than two hours spent at activities deemed 'contingent'.

The data gathered by the researchers was the first comprehensive analysis of its kind in the world and it was commissioned by health authorities worldwide to help them improve their strategies to prevent health conditions that can lead to chronic diseases.

In addition, the study was published in the journal Pediatrics with the support of the Wellcome Trust and the Australian National High School.

While the group's findings had no relevance to Australians, national health advice is also based around the recommendations of the government's National Physical Activity strategy, which makes it clear that physical activity should come second to sleep and the environment in terms of a healthful lifestyle.
