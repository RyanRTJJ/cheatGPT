The council is proposing a new awards system that will recognise outstanding contributions to the city and the creation of a meaningful legacy. This new annual awards ceremony seeks to honour those who have gone above and beyond to benefit the city, its citizens, and its standing on the world stage. 

The first recipient of the award will be singer Ariana Grande, as her leadership and work on the One Love Manchester benefit concert in 2017 made a great impact on the city. The concert, which was held in honour of the victims of the previous year's bombing, raised over Â£3.5 million that was used to benefit the victims and their families. The event and its spirit of unity stood as testament to the strength and resilience of the people of Manchester. 

The award ceremony will take place on June 4, 2019 and is expected to be attended by the Mayor of Manchester, in addition to local dignitaries and celebrities from around the world. 

All proceeds from the event will go towards a trust in honour of the victims of the bombing. The trust will aim to provide educational, emotional, and financial support for those affected and their families.
