had been in contact with the family eight times over a four month period prior to the incident. The police investigation into the incident led to Nicholson being charged with murder. In June 2015, he was acquitted of the charge following a trial, but found guilty of manslaughter and causing death by gross negligence. Nicholson was sentenced to 18 years in prison. 

Tequiilah's death highlighted the need for more collaborative working between agencies and the importance of developing strategies to reduce the risks of future tragic events. Following a serious case review into the incident, Newcastle City Council's Safeguarding Board created a series of safety plans for the family, put in place a multi-agency referral system to allow for early intervention, and worked with local agencies to ensure all risks were identified and addressed prior to any further contact with the family. The Council also introduced training for safeguarding professionals around creating safety plans and working collaboratively when a risk is identified. 


In 2016, Tequiilah's mother, Victoria, was presented with a posthumous 'bravery award' by Newcastle City Council in honour of her daughter. The award was given to Victoria to recognise the courage displayed by Tequiilah in her ordeal.
