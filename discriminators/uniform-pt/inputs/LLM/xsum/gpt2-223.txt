 But now, a week earlier, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has confirmed the submarine's existence—the largest piece of evidence yet.The ship can sail from the U.S. east coast to Canada and back. Now that the ocean has begun to catch up with the tides—the speed of the water rising above the water floor—the ocean now takes on a much more powerful, yet less visible form of light. That will make the submarine less like an island of waves on the horizon.And those same currents will be felt around us, too. A tiny, two-hour long pulse of tiny photons, known as lightwave radiation, will pass through the depths of the ocean below the water surface, generating a powerful wave. That wave will travel in an arc, which might be much like a lightbulb effect on the ocean. "This is a completely different kind of electrical, chemical, mechanical, and life threatening event," says Brian Kress, a physicist and co-author on the paper. "People have known that there is a long-term, extremely powerful wave effect on the ocean, and people have been pretty suspicious."But with the help of the United States Navy, which launched the sub today from Yokosuka, Japan—a sprawling facility designed to test ocean-based weapons systems—the Navy has revealed the full story.To put the matter bluntly, in the past, it could have been possible to send the ocean light back in time to see the first glimpse of a comet. But that could all get out of hand. Kress and his colleagues have now discovered that this is what may be the strongest possibility for an alien-looking planet around the same time we see Pluto: a comet in its own right. They plan on sending the spacecraft out in September, and have a full-scale look from those days. And while they've learned a lot about living things, they are still getting their first taste of things that could change the way we think.
