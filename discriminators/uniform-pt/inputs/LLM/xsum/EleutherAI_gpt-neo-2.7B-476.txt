German economist Holger Schmieding says interest rates are now about five times higher in the eurozone than they were before Greece joined the euro in 2009.

“I’m very afraid of another sovereign (insolvency) crisis. If we have another sovereign crisis in Europe, then the euro will collapse,” he said.

“That would bring big problems with it for the markets. You would have interest rates at record highs again. You would have huge credit bubble. You don’t need any inflation at all. I would like to see prices falling and interest rates falling.”

German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble last month warned that Greece might need to ask for a 50-billion-euro bailout if it were to turn to the International Monetary Fund in October to unlock aid. Such a bailout request would not be a foregone conclusion for Greece, the former British colony and EU member-state.

The IMF has no authority under the international “bailout” system. Instead, the Greek government is asking European Union states to help to unlock financial support to the country. The IMF has said that because of the country’s weak banks and an unemployment rate of 25 percent, it is unlikely Greece could win such a bailout.

If Greece does default, economists believe, then European sovereign bonds would face a selloff.

With the euro zone crisis showing no sign of abating this month, the IMF said last week it expected interest rates to remain stuck for much of 2013.

The euro area as a whole had expanded its central bank’s stimulus as early as this month. In the 19-nation bloc, an extra one-point increase in the ECB’s monthly deficit target came late last week, bringing it to 8.5 percent from 8.3 percent.

The euro currency, used by more than two-thirds of developed-nation imports, had plunged to its lowest level since the 1980s against major currencies as a result of the crisis.
