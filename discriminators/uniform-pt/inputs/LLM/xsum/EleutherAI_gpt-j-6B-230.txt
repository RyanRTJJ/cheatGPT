A statement posted online - also attributed to a police spokesperson - said the officers had acted on behalf of the Kenyan Police Service (KPS). Both the KPS and the National Disaster Management Unit (NDMU) deny responsibility. 'Desecration' The KCC spokesperson, Paul Njoroge, also accused a foreign government of being behind the attack, saying he believed it was a desecration. Mr Odinga is challenging President Mwai Kibaki in the run-off on 27 August. In a statement, he urged people not to succumb to an atmosphere of "fear and panic" and said that he would "give no ground" in his bid to become the first freely-elected president in Kenya's history. It is unclear when the flyers were first seen, but The Times says the BBC had them on Thursday morning. It says they were in a letterbox in Nyayo House in Nairobi, the official residence of the Kenyan president. The BBC's Tomi Oladipo in Nairobi says the flyers first appeared in Kimusu, a town in Mr Odinga's home region. But it is not clear who posted the flyers there, although The Times says they could have been posted outside the village as part of a warning to journalists covering the election.
