 over to law enforcement agencies all of the information we have on the people, the companies involved and the events," he said. "And we are happy to be able to say it's now much earlier in the process. "Once investigations such as these start, they can take years to complete." The football authorities said on Tuesday said they were pleased that the police had completed the "urgent" investigation into bribery allegations.

The two Swiss national federations, however, said they were unable to comment further on the matter as it might damage their chances of re-admitting their respective clubs back into the football world's biggest men's competition.

With its new owners, US-based IMG, Fifa will now be seeking a review of the situation. The two Swiss national federations also said they will look into the case as they are bound to do as national ethics committees require them to do when they become aware of wrongdoing.

"There were obviously no further arrests made in Zurich (after the arrests in May 2015) other than the one, who was not arrested, who is currently serving a prison sentence in Switzerland," said Bern's Uefa vice-president for Fifa's commercial services JÃ¼rgen Boschl. "We are still following the case and we will review the situation and provide the relevant information to the Swiss authorities and Fifa in due course." The Swiss Federal Ethics Office will look into the allegations after the Swiss national federations, which are the only ones in the world who have jurisdiction over Fifa and are responsible for ethics compliance, inform them of the allegations. That process usually takes eight days, said Boschl. "In addition, we have to look at all the people involved and if there are grounds for bringing them to the attention of the relevant authorities," Uefa added.
