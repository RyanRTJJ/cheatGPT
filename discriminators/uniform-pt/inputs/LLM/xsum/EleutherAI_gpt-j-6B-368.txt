, then Justice Minister, called the behaviour "appalling", and she told MPs that jail authorities had promised to investigate the allegations. She said that if the government were to become aware of similar conduct elsewhere, "we would respond in a similar fashion".

The jail said this week, in a statement posted on its website, that it was "extremely concerned" about the allegations and was working with the Prison Governors' Association to establish the facts".

A Channel 4 News investigation into the allegations found that the Prison Service was investigating allegations of bullying, harassment and intimidation at HMP Durham and HMP Elmbridge.

One prisoner in Durham, who did not want to be named, claimed: "They call you a slag and a bitch and stuff. I mean, in there you get treated like an animal. My sister was in there for about four months and she's pregnant so she was kept in with six people â€“ six men and them. Some would say 'Come here you beast', and stuff like that, you know. You're trying not to but they make you do it."

Another man said: "If you're a bit slow to get up, you will get bashed. And if you come out for water, you'll get bashed. All of us have, you wouldn't not get bashed. I mean, they come in, they see you lying down and they call you a beast. I had a man called Mark come in after I'd knocked myself out and he put me in isolation. I remember him calling me a bitch, a bitches, in front of the staff, and stuff like that, and the next thing I knew, he'd hit me in the face."

In the same place, another man said: "The problem is, you can't say anything. Everybody gets punched, you know, on the head. You can get punched on the backside, you've got your backside to the wall and they hit you on your head every day, or you get the stick. Or you get the buckle, or you get hit with a baton and stuff, you know.
