 the Indian Ocean, to press charges.

On Tuesday, the ICC judge presiding at Akayesu's trial ruled that he must be released despite strong objections by the prosecution. The government was given 15 days to appeal but so far hasn't taken up the case, indicating that it doesn't view the ruling as politically significant.

During his trial, Akayesu -- a former teacher and now pastor -- insisted the sexual encounters with the women were consensual. He maintained he had been given permission to use an unlicenced SIM card when he visited South Africa in 2015.

The ruling means Akayesu will no longer be prosecuted in ICC custody, but he has made it clear that he will continue to challenge his trial convictions at the appellate level, the BBC's Mike Wooldridge reports from Nairobi.

South Africa's top court last year dropped charges due to "insufficient evidence", and the matter was referred to the ICC, where he faces a possible 20-year prison sentence.

Akayesu has pleaded not guilty to charges under two sections of the ICC statute -- abuse of position and a failure to prevent crimes -- and could face a five-year prison term if he is convicted, our correspondent says.

The ICC, which The Hague-based court insists is independent of the United Nations, was set up in 2002 to deal with grave crimes, including genocide and war crimes, but has no enforcement powers.

The ICC was created after the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was dissolved in 2003.

The world's most-wanted war criminal is believed to be former Liberian President Charles Taylor, facing war crimes and crimes against humanity charges. His trial started two months ago in The Hague. He denies most of the charges and has asked for a trial in Liberia. The ICC has refused to comment on the case.

Other top ICC cases include those of Kenyan rebel leader Charles Onyancha, former Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo and Sudanese President
