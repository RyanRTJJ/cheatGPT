 a software update, which would be released in 2017.

Volkswagen recently confirmed that it will bring in a fix by 2017 to address the scandal, which broke out in September when it was discovered that German engineers had used software to conceal emissions irregularities. The company has said the affected German models will get a fix that enables the vehicles to meet emissions standards when driving in ideal (clean) city conditions, but under'real world driving conditions' (as on a motorway or in rush hour traffic) when they would be unable to comply with the emission laws.

The company says around 10 million vehicles with the affected engines are on sale globally, with emissions cheating at a much lower level in the USA. However, the scandal has hurt the carmaker, leading to a drop in value of 2.5% in October.

Mr. Willits said the issue was a'serious one', and that the company would have to put out recalls, and potentially other fixes.

“We have to do a couple of things including taking cars that are sold, sending them back and making them fit to drive again.

"One of the measures we are working on is to give owners an option to see if they have another option to put their cars back into top emission (clean vehicles) mode. However, that was the least of our problems right now.

“We have now taken cars out of sale and sent them back to be fixed, but it's not about the small number of [engines], it's about how do you treat a problem where a manufacturer has deceived their customers.

Volkswagen's managing director of vehicle development, Frank Wiesmann, said that the company was “not considering a second diesel option but this is still an open question when the technology matures.”

A recent survey conducted by IHS Markit has found that in the UK, around 17% of petrol engine cars and just under one in 10 diesel cars have been affected by software cheating.
