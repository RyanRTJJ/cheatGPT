 do" for the firm and he would continue to focus on his own company. That is likely to include bringing more acquisitions. He noted that, "I don't want [to be] the guy saying, 'Well you know, you should have kept more money in your own company.' You just have to own what you are, and you don't have to do it all."

Almanza added: "We made a tough pivot from a large company to an enterprise software company, and it can be a hard and painful process."

BMO Capital Markets reiterated their underperform rating on United Rentals in a report out late last month, saying the company's cash flow had declined from around US$22 million to just US$5 million over the last four quarters. While United Rentals shares edged up today on the news that it is exiting the acquisition of a small to mid-sized player, the stock remains well below the $1.20 range and more than 90 percent below their 52-week high of US$1.53.

Almanza said that for the second quarter, he expects the company's cash to decline by about US$2 million as part of the separation process. In an investor call, he stated that the deal would be "the first of many" opportunities to make acquisitions in the future. He said the target could be worth "much more than $500 million" if United Rentals could develop a similar "digital first" model in other markets such as India.

Almanza said that the separation process would allow him to focus on building his current company and that he didn't "want to be the company that says, 'Should we have kept more money in our own company?' It is just part of being the founder of this company. You just have to own what you are."

Separate the company from the business and it's a better bet for shareholders.
