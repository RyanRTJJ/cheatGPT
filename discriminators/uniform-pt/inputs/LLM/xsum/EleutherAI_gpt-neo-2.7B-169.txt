 mild symptoms in most people.

Zika is contracted through mosquito bites, and infected people are not usually contagious for more than two months. Some people who are infected do not have any symptoms. However, in the past four months, over 3,000 US cases of Zika have been reported, and the virus has spread to over 1,000 areas of the country, prompting U.S. health officials to declare it a public health emergency.

“This is a major public health emergency,” said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Aedes aegypti mosquitoes spread Zika because they carry the virus from an infected person, and are the primary source of transmission in Miami, New York and elsewhere.

The first case of Zika transmitted outside Brazil has been confirmed in South Florida. The CDC confirmed last week that a pregnant woman born in Cuba infected with Zika was traveling through Brazil to return home to Missouri.

“We cannot assume that any particular traveler from South or Central America will become infected,” Schuchat said at a media briefing this week. “But we need to be prepared and know what to look for.”

According to the CDC, people should avoid going to those who have been recently in the water or who have symptoms of the mosquito-borne illness, such as fever or a rash. They should also monitor for Zika signs and symptoms. If someone develops a rash, or has a fever as high as 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), they should seek medical attention as soon as possible.

The CDC estimates that about 1% to 4% of the population has been exposed to Zika. The agency noted Zika is present in all US states, with the exception of Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware and Hawaii. Most mosquito-borne illnesses are spread by the female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, and scientists are watching to see if infected mosquitoes transmit Zika, too — a possibility that experts expect won’t be confirmed for months.

The CDC notes, however, that mosquito bites aren’t typically the source of the Zika infection so-called “silent” or “latent” spread. If a
