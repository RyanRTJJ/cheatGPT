 Thompson, meant Liam Johnson's header did not reach the net.

Millwall then had a chance to get back into the game when a free-kick from Lee-Anne White hit the bar.

But the visitors levelled from the spot, when striker Tom Phillips' cross looped under the crossbar.

The result means Millwall stay away from safety, with two games left to play.

And they have seven games remaining against Swansea City, Bristol City, Coventry City, Colchester City and Barnet.

Millwall manager Paul Clement:

"We are a bit on a run, where sometimes we don't feel as though the last few months have gone really well.

"It's the first time against a bigger team, a bigger club in the Championship.

"I thought we were stronger than our last away trip to Tranmere and we deserved to win because we came here to win.

"But I spoke to the players, they all wanted to come back here and feel we had prepared at a good level. We need to play better and we need to give ourselves an opportunity to do that."

But Millwall took a surprise lead when striker Phillips scored the winning goal in the 76th minute.

Kerry Turner almost gave the Dragons a 2-1 lead in the second half but he failed to clear after the ball was driven past him by Josh King.

But Mills converted it against the run of play when after a quick move, Phillips' shot broke in to the top corner from close range.

The result leaves Millwall seven points clear of Swansea City in fourth and three places above Barnet for the top spot under chairman Malcolm Glazer.

Millwall manager Liam Moore: "I thought we were much stronger than our previous game, but I am more frustrated at the fact that it was a free-kick which hit the bar."

Millwall have now won four of their last five after taking 25
