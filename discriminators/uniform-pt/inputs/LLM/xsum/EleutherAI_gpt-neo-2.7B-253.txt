 approval, but a High Court judge sided with the fracking company in July 2012.

The company had spent £300,000 developing the site, while Ryedale Borough Council and North Yorkshire County Council had spent £500,000 each in connection with planning and environmental work. The case was due to be heard again on Monday 18th August, but is now to be stayed.

Last year, North Yorkshire County Council gave Friends of the Earth planning permission to protest at the site. On the day Friends issued the news that they were to be granted another court order, the company issued the following press release:

"North Yorkshire County Council has granted planning permission for the controversial shale gas development at Kirby Misperton in Ryedale. In light of the recent news that the company intends to drill further at their Kirby Misperton facility, this decision has caused concern and raises serious questions over the future of fracking in North Yorkshire.".

North Yorkshire County Council said in August that the planning decision would affect 3.8 km of land. A fracking industry spokesman said that it was "business as usual'' at Kirby Misperton.

Friends of the Earth have today written to North Yorkshire County Council complaining that it should not grant planning permission in view of the company's plans to increase its fracking capacity at the site.

Kirby Misperton is currently the largest on-shore fracking site in the UK with planning permission already granted for the north side of the site by North Yorkshire County.

The Friends of the Earth letter to North Yorkshire County Council states:

"The company is attempting to develop the whole site from the north side of the site by adding further vertical wells. This is opposed by residents, neighbours and the community and would lead to an unnecessary increase in pollution, waste and noise.

"Further planning permission is unnecessary and is likely to increase the pressure on local residents. The company cannot carry on as if it has planning permission, but should be seeking additional information to enable it to conduct a proper planning inquiry as soon as possible."

Friends of the Earth have previously issued legal proceedings against fracking company Cuadrilla for their plans for another shale gas well at Kirby Misperton.
