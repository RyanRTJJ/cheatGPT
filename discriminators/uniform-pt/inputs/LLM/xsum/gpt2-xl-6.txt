 the city centre, to Euston, in southern London. They arrived in the early hours, after many had left home and it began to drizzle. "We were in complete disbelief," she said. "People started coming out of pubs in the city centre."

For the next three hours, she helped thousands of passengers through the delays that occurred every day on this section of the Northern Line between Euston and Farringdon. "At times I was the only woman in the station. I even had a police escort," she said. She went to bed at midnight.

The next morning, the first day of a national strike by London Underground staff over pay and conditions, she and her team scrambled to prepare. "We started tweeting that you could be paid more if you signed up for TubePlus," she said. The number of sign-ups increased by 7,000 in a matter of hours.

It included new uniforms for each station, including the bright green-and-white ones used now in the capital. Her team's "jogging gear" had now "gained some new life", she said.

"It's very much a win-win for the staff. We are all on the same team." To mark the occasion, women are wearing their old uniforms, with the slogan "London Underground's all-women Team".
