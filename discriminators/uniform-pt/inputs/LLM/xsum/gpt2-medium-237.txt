 internet security has emerged as a hot-button issue among China's ruling elite, who often use sensitive military and government data to advance their goals.

On Friday, security experts from Kaspersky Lab, Symantec and the Chinese government's Center for Strategic and International Studies said they had found no evidence to suggest China had deliberately engineered the attack, according to AFP.

But the cyber-security firm on Sunday called on the US and Russia to jointly investigate the damage.

"We urge all the powers to assist us in our investigation."

The hack prompted concerns in Western capitals that China, another threat to the US, is getting into cyber security more quickly and that Beijing had successfully breached the US's cyberspace defences.

The US State Department is stepping up its response to a breach at the oil giant in July, while officials from the UK and other governments met US President Barack Obama last month in Beijing.

Analysts say China wants to secure its information and that the hacking events and attacks appear to indicate Beijing is trying to exert more control over its cyber capabilities.
