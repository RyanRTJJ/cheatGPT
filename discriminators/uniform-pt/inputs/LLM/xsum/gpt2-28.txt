 is facing charges relating to alcohol offences and negligent driving. His family refused to comment.

MacSherry's case attracted international attention as she had a prior criminal conviction for being drunk on the high street, having just finished a prison term for an assault on a judge.

Mills's family also refused to comment as neither Ms MacSherry's nor her lawyer indicated in court whether they would be interested in coming forward.

Dionne MacSherry, who was previously seen at the bar as a potential partner, was found dead on the floor of a nearby toilet room. His killer left behind a list of 19 other people, some of whom had been in a dispute with staff at the bar, at the bar's location. They were convicted of four deaths between 2008 and February 2009 including two of Mills's sons.

Mills's family of eight, with eight children, were ordered to remove the coffin from a waiting room and to have it buried on the same day. The family had filed for a new inquest and a criminal court had told the judges they would go ahead and look at the case.

Mr Williams, 42, was one of 13 people charged in the murders, including two adults, who had tried unsuccessfully to claim a criminal record before being placed on death row in 2008.

Anthony Williams, 24, and his two children had also been charged as potential witnesses, prosecutors have told The Sun.

Mr Williams, who was living with his parents, a sister and two daughters, made six appearances in the inquest before serving a sentence of five years.

His brothers Daniel and John joined the row when both they were 16. Mr Williams, who was not a member of the family until 2005, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for the murders, according to prosecutors.
