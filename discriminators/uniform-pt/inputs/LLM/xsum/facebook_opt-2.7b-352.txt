 terrified because it was a complete surprise. He slept all night and woke up happy and fit and healthy," she told the Mirror. "But the next day, his temperature was over 100Â°. I was absolutely petrified."

A scan showed her that she had suffered a bleed on the brain called haemorrhagic stroke. The brain-bleeding disorder causes a massive and devastating blood clot and stroke. She added that because she had suffered an epileptic fits over a decade ago - which she said "couldn't have affected the baby" - she was prescribed valproic acid.

"But I refused it, so they just started me on a blood-thinning medication, Coumadin," said Sumner.

Her son Noah spent three years in hospital recovering from the stroke and then he developed epilepsy. At 13, Noah began going into convulsions, which Sumner said could have triggered the clot for which she was admitted. She recalled one moment when her son "had a massive seizure and the next thing I knew, he was on the ground twitching."

Sumner blamed his seizure on the drug Valproic Acid, because "everyone else around me was taking it". And, just four months ago, she was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer. Doctors believe her haemorrhagic stroke may have been an aggravating factor to her rare cancer. Sumner was prescribed medication, which included the blood thinner Coumadin.

"Doctors said Noah had very little chance of surviving a seizure, but now that he's been seizure-free he's a thriving baby," said Sumner, adding that she had been "very lucky" because if it had not been for her child's seizure, she may have suffered from the condition for many years. "I'm devastated not only for Noah, but also for myself, as well as my mum and dad. If things had gone the other way, I may have died or I may have passed on my genetic conditions to Noah.
