ian "The World Anti-Doping Agency" ("WADA"), which supplied the drug, under a contract with the US Postal Service, until the end of 2018. Investigators have said that they believed the doping network was likely linked to the US Postal Service's national cycling program.


"It's an issue of national security. For me it's all about the NSA in this case," a former WADA consultant told CyclingTips.com. "I'd imagine there's a lot of concerns the whole case involving WADA and the US government."

WADA, meanwhile, has reportedly paid WADA $4 million over eight years for "a non-translated WADA document in question", with the document allegedly written in Arabic by WADA staff and "signed by Dr. Eufemian himself".

CyclingTips.com has received word of the settlement, which is reported as a "$4.2 million reward".

The US Postal Service does not report payments to the US Anti-Doping Agency based on their legal fees. They also do not disclose payouts since WADA did not respond to an AP request for information and declined to provide any more details.
