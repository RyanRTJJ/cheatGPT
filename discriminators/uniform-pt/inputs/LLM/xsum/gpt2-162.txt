 Légia!, describes a life of slavery.

After being released from the prison, it was decided that Ms Betancourt would have some kind of legal right to keep the book, telling them in written form that if it were translated as an erotic poem she would no longer be in contact with her captors and that they would return the book to its original place.

Last month, US senator Dianne Feinstein revealed that a translation book had been smuggled out of Colombia by former British government official James "Mad Libs" MacKinnon and that it contained "an unhelpful and distressing list of personal crimes and horrificities" during two years of hard labour.

She did not mention the name of the book, or its publisher, which was published on December 26, 2002.

She also said: "You would not see this book in Colombia today. If you want to see it in Colombia, you would have to go to the library. It's not there - on the shelves it's there - just in the black and dark library."

Last 3rd generation

The author of the "Meme Le Légia!", says that her mother-in-law found out about her book through her brother and that he found it at the school that she attended and the parents of each of them thought that she was a good character.

She told the newspaper that they bought the book in 2009 at a small town in Mexico town of Veracruz for less than £1.

"A group of about two to three family members came and asked to keep the book under a cloud because you could not be able to write it if you were in the US or wherever.

"Since I lived here, the library and all of the libraries are so very close by and they were able to find it at the time because it was in my mother-in-law's hand."

Ms Betancourt explains the book was published in Mexico in 1994 to keep her young daughter in the US as she needed
