 isn't true to say there will be no private investors involved in building more than 50 schools... they will continue to look at building more schools."

But some of the most high profile investors are concerned about the risk of being taken over by the government. "We think it will put the viability of the projects in doubt," says Steve Hill, a spokesman for the Chartered Institute of Building Engineers (Cobe), a trade body made up of private sector employers which is funding a campaign for a review. "It's just that the government's got no clear direction. How are the private sector expected to take the risk?" he asks.

One of the big questions is what Mr Hill refers to as the "burden of proof" that private investors will be asked to justify their projects' viability, the reason they are worth investing in. He suspects such an undertaking will lead to long delays in starting work, and an increase in borrowing costs.

The Cobe group has come up with an alternative plan.

It would only fund local authority projects. There would be no private sector involvement. The public sector could borrow more cheaply than if it had to go to private investors. And the government would be able - and would want - to intervene directly in critical building infrastructure.

However, Mr Hill says if the government sets too tightly a process for its intervention, it will have to pay too much to borrow in the longer term; or if it over-reaches, then it will get a reputation for over-reach.

He says Cobe represents a "wide church" because its members are split over whether national or local government should be running building projects.

In the past they have funded large, prestigious, expensive projects like the National Children's Hospital in Belfast or the Royal Free Hospital in London. These have helped recruit staff and given a lift to the economy.

The Cobe campaign will be launched at the House of Commons on Thursday morning.
