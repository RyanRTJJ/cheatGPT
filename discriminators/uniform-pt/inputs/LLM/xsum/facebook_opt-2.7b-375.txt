.2bn in its financials since 2013.

The firm said in a statement that the decision for the EGM had been made in light of concerns raised by shareholders.

The group first stated its findings on 20 November.

The auditor has said that it uncovered $1.2bn worth of “unrecognized net deferred tax assets”, though it did note that its results should have been “previously restated to better align the amounts accounted for in the financial statements that are presented”.

“While we could not find a specific reason to justify the unreported additional items, we acknowledge that a significant mistake was made in accounting for the intangible assets,” the statement said.

The EGM will be attended by the chairperson and two directors of the group, besides those who requested the meeting.

The board members had also accepted a $6.25m payment from the Australian regulator to settle claims of misconduct.

The settlement is believed to be the biggest in the history of Australian corporate law.

Novo Nordisk’s share price had plummeted by 12% following the release of the firm’s unaudited annual report for the year to 31 March 2016.

The company has denied the allegations of the missing $1.2bn.

The Danish pharmaceutical firm said it remains committed to maintaining its transparency and high standards.

Novo has been asked to submit a written justification for its actions by April 30.

On April 18, the company said it would begin an internal investigation and that there had been a change of leadership, with CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen taking over from outgoing boss Anders Runevad on 1 June.

Last week it was announced that Jorgensen had agreed to relinquish his post as CEO of the company he has worked for for almost 20 years.

“It is with regret that we must announce that due to personal reasons Anders Runevad will not be able to continue as chief executive officer of Novo Nordisk,” the Danish national pharmaceutical company said in a statement.
