omplaints about unruly panhandling, aggressive costumes and boisterous behavior. In addition to asking costumed characters to curb their enthusiasm, the proposed regulations would limit the number of costumed performers at any one time and impose an occupational license requirement. The regulations would also require characters to stay within the confines of designated areas and provide the Department of Health with a list of performers. Residents, visitors and business owners alike in Times Square all hope that these regulations will ensure safety, civility, and a better experience for all. 

The proposed regulations would allow city officials to better oversee costumed characters who populate Times Square. First, having an occupational license requirement would ensure that characters have undergone thorough background checks. This helps keep visitors and residents safe from those with criminal backgrounds. Additionally, limiting the number of costumed characters would reduce pedestrian crowding and allow visitors to better maneuver their way through the area. With limited performers, visitors will not feel overwhelmed and uncomfortable. Finally, confining costumed characters to designated areas will also help keep traffic congestion at a minimum. All in all, these regulations would help protect the safety and comfortable of Times Squareâ€™s residents, visitors and businesses.
