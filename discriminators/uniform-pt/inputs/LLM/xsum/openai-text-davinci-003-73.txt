o had travelled to America’s most populous city to take part in the famous race, when he spotted fellow runner Laila Anderson, a 47-year-old mother-of-four from Indiana, struggling to make it to the finish line. Despite being several minutes behind his own time, Terry abandoned his own race and instead dropped his pace and lent Laila vital encouragement and support. Upon reaching the finish he literally carried her, literally and figuratively, across the line.

The heartwarming moment has been captured on camera and shared widely across social media and news outlets, garnering more than 12 million views on YouTube and hundreds of thousands of comments. It was also chosen as the ‘Feel Good Moment of the Day’ by the official Boston Marathon Facebook page.

The support of Terry, a complete stranger to Laila, is an inspiring example of the power of one act of kindness. Despite the physical and emotional challenge facing him, Terry chose to decenter himself and help another racer towards their goal, an inspiring gesture welcomed by many. Laila later remarked: “It was a truly heartwarming moment, when you are out and so close to finishing it’s hard to not feel a bit alone but Terry giving me that extra boost to finish really made it so much more special”.

The moving episode is a testament to the idea that everybody can rise to the occasion and that one small act of kindness and support can be enough to help someone else reach the end. Well done Terry – you truly are an inspiration!
