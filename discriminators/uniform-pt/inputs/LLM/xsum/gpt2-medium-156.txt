 two-year contract to use or change the floor space at a central hub office block, rather than an office block with its own central space on floor-to-ceiling windows.

He also said that if a group has more than 60 employees, it can rent any space in the central hub without having to pay the central hub's rent.

The council said that since 2009 it had seen more than 12,000 new and renewals for office space, with rent rising in the four quarters from £80m to £88m, while average rent at central hub tenants has increased, rising from £863 per month to £858 per month.

It also pointed out: "The Central Labour Council has increased by £400m in Greater Manchester since 2001, and its annual budget has expanded significantly in real terms.

"It will be necessary to meet rising demand which threatens public services across Greater Manchester to secure reliable office space for the many that need it most."

The council said it must do more to deal with building sites without sufficient parking spaces for tenants. Local businesses need to be "constrained", meaning they have to sell off their shops on streetsides to keep them open, it added.

The move comes after Greater Manchester was placed on "red alert" after the council said a new report that saw the issue of people taking up to 3D-printed copies of the Queen's Birthday cake outside properties.

It added that its review would now explore ways to make sure developers are properly "targeted" on where such actions take place.

There has recently been a dramatic rise in attempts to take over large public offices such as council tax cuts.

In March last year another petition urging the council to increase the age limit from 50 to 65 to cover older housing associations fell through after petitions and social media had already been signed.
