A day later, the team will have another challenge against Manchester United but there has been great news to be gleaned as the rest of the squad prepares to field their Champions League finalists.

The first of nine matches

Tottenham, 4-1-1, Chelsea, 10-4

Sporting Kansas City, 1-1-0, Everton, 11-2

Manchester United, 2-2-0, Tottenham, 8-4

Sunderland, 3-0-0, Crystal Palace, 7-5

Newcastle United, 3-0-0, Chelsea, 7-5

Manchester City, 3-0-1, Everton, 11-3

Everton and Chelsea qualify, while Stoke and Stoke City are eliminated.

Sporting Kansas City lost five of their last six games as well as drawing 2-0 in the Europa League quarter-finals, while Sunderland fell 2-0 to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals.

The Premier League has been well run, the last relegation-threatened side winning their last five games after losing a league tie the previous five times and winning their last nine meetings.

Newcastle United and Sunderland, meanwhile, face the bottom of the table in the Premier League, with two remaining from a match against Paris St-Germain at Old Trafford on Tuesday afternoon.

The teams must also be able to travel and train before the season ends in August ahead of the opening game in Leicester on Sunday.

The best available game will take place at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday. The match takes place after two matches in the Capital One Cup, when both teams face off at Wembley Stadium.

It is also the match the FA is keen to make a return to, with the FA having taken a lead over Manchester United in the table in July in the final campaign.

This may come under new government scrutiny following claims by former players that they were "bouncing" between the two clubs when they met in 2010.
