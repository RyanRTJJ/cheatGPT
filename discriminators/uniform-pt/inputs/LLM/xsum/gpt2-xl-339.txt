 banned him from leaving the country, following his release from prison after serving an indeterminate sentence for sedition.

"We are trying to reach Mohammad Asghar with the help of the British consulate," a Pakistani official reportedly told a British envoy.

"We will try to negotiate for him," said the envoy, according to Pakistani media reports.

A Pakistani official said that Asghar was shot "violently" and suffered bullet wounds to the groin and buttocks.

He was detained in February 2015 on charges of spying for Pakistan's enemies India and China in what is believed to be a cover for planning attacks.

Asghar had been convicted of promoting religious hatred and attacking army and police personnel; but his conviction has recently been quashed. At his trial, he denied the charge but apologized for the attack.

He also apologised for an August 2014 attack, on the Jamia Niaha public university in Lahore, which killed more than 150 people, including children and university staff.

British diplomats in Pakistan have expressed concern that Asghar is in "a precarious condition".

The British Foreign Office has contacted all British nationals in Adiala jail and the surrounding district and requested immediate and full release.

Foreign Office spokesperson said:

"We are urgently seeking further information on the circumstances of the injury to a British national Muhammad Asghar, and we are very concerned for his injury.

"We are working to establish his current location and we are doing so with the Pakistani authorities."
