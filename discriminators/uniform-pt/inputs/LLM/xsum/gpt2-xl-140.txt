The family are deeply grateful for the support of the public.

Police Scotland said the incident had been brought to their attention, and has apologised. In addition, Ms Bell was told that she did not need to go to court today because the officer had acted "appropriately in speaking to her."

The family will now examine a full file of the incident in case of any further incident, and a police sergeant has been put in charge of the investigation with a senior officer to support her.

Earlier the family said: "We were very shocked, very saddened and angry when we realised that our daughter was taken. I said to her: 'If I lose my daughter then everything I have worked so hard for in my life will be for nothing.'

"This is a very difficult day for our family.

"I know it's a terrible time for my family. My husband has been out in the cold all night searching his property for her.

"Lamara Bell has been through the worst of it too, you can almost understand. We want to apologise to you too for the sadness we're experiencing. Thanking everyone for your kind thoughts and your prayers is immensely appreciated."
