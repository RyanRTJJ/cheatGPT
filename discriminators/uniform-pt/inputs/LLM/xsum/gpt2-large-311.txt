 of Kennedy being kissed by Mike Moore, who was at the ceremony for the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission.

The two had their moment together in a short film released by Nasa in 2008, showing Moore's famous take-off pose in a NASA t-shirt under the words "Mission Accomplished". Moore also famously played a character dubbed the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four films.

There was nothing of the sort in the Cubs clubhouse before and after the fireworks and Kennedy's arrival.

The two men seemed to know each other well, said manager Joe McAdoo. "They were talking a little more about politics than anything else, but they were talking about baseball, which is something they really really like about each other," he said.

Although he declined to comment on what might have been said, he dismissed questions over the role of Kennedy in Moore's film, tweeting: "The two were working on a film that wasn't made until Kennedy came over. #goodtimes."

He then posted: "We were talking in our hotel about baseball but now the guy who played the Human Torch and then said #HumanTron ran out of champagne, just like you."

Cubs outfielder Addison Russell also came away with a picture of Kennedy, adding @misscj5 "I was talking to him on the phone. Just kidding I was telling him about my wife's bday."

But after Kennedy arrived in the building, Moore said: "I'll never forget this: a young lady came over to the Cubs dugout and sat down right next to him. She said 'Will you be my husband?' And then he looked up at her and smiled and said 'Yep.'"

The two shook hands and hugged, and in his post-game press conference held a photo of Kennedy with his wife in one hand and a plate of cookies in the other. The Cubs won 5-1 in a game which was in fact the last of the National League
