A hearing held at the High Court in Dublin on Wednesday heard she has paid a €1,000 fine and €1,000 in prosecution costs after accepting an alternative non-custodial sentence of 18 months in gaol.

Judge Martin Nolan QC ordered MacSherry to be of good behaviour while behind bars.

Barrister Sean Gillane, for Ms MacSherry, told Judge Nolan that the defendant accepts that the incident which led to her being banned from driving did result in the death of Mr Mills.

He said the defendant made no comment and left the court with her husband and legal team, having entered a plea of guilty in relation to the charge.

Before going into open court, the judge thanked the defendant for agreeing to accept the non-custodial penalty.

He said the court would take into consideration the good character and community service background of the 41-year-old.

Mr Gillane said Ms MacSherry, from Drimnagh, Dublin 22, is of good character.

He said her conviction relates to an incident in which it can be alleged she caused the death of a man at the side of a main road, causing serious injury to another person.

Mr Gillane said Ms MacSherry accepts that the incident which led to her being banned from driving did result in the death of Mr Mills, resulting from the actions of other driver.

He said the defendant accepts she was driving the grey Audi RS 3, on the approach to the entrance of the Old Road in Co Meath, on October 17, 2015.

He said she took a left up a road, driving the Audi in a north-westerly direction, before making one left-hand turn which led her to rejoin the main road.

He said Ms MacSherry then drove in a north-westerly direction, driving the BMW in a parallel position with the Audi, before Ms MacSherry made an overtaking manoeuvre in the left-hand lane on the Old Road near Largiey and continued driving northwesterly.

He said Ms MacSherry then proceeded north into the middle lane of the Old Road before accelerating from the second left-hand turn
