 by British astronaut Steve Reid, who told reporters: "I believe we have the most extraordinary technology. It is all made possible thanks to the efforts of the Hubble Space Telescope (that was a great success) and the work of the Royal Commission." The £6m investment would be fully compatible with the design of NASA's International Space Station and could be made available to engineers using existing equipment and technology, a spokesman said. That would allow the Space Transportation Board to work with Nasa to make new and more efficient flights that are cheaper for the company to run.

An Atlas-5 Heavy Lift Vehicle – which will arrive in 2020 – is currently on board the Space Station as part of an £86m expansion programme to support the space agency's human exploration of the solar system, where it now has about 700 crew.

In 2017, Nasa will launch a commercial payload service to carry the crew to Mars that will cost £5bn over four years to build from a commercial asteroid.

If the launch of the Atlas 5 on the red planet were to pass the pre-planned cost threshold, the United States would have to buy enough propellant to make up for one-third of the space agency's operational costs. That means NASA will have to buy at most half a cargo on board, which would save about £6bn in the five years before it is launched, a spokesman said.

A spokesperson said this was "much cheaper than most countries at the moment", adding: "We don't expect to have any trouble financing this in the future."

The cost of using existing equipment and facilities will not change much the launch would be about: if the spacecraft is ever set to dock, space capsules on NASA's international space station would get put into a dock, which will have to be brought back to Earth before the ISS ever goes home.

The space agency already plans to use the unmanned Falcon Heavy rocket on its Space Launch System to deliver cargo from the ISS, although its first human cargo
