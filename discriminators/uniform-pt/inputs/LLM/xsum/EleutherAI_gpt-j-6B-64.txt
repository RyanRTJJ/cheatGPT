gordon rescued one girl and six men from the vessel, which sank within two minutes.

Earlier this year, four men were injured when the vessel struck the harbourside at Wemyss Bay. And a year ago, around 100 young men had to be rescued from the sinking in similar weather conditions.

In the years since the SS Storm, two larger vessels have also foundered at Johnshaven.

The MV Brora Queen, which was owned by the Ministry of Agriculture, hit a shoal in the early hours of 15 December, 2002, when 13 people were on board.

The SS Kainui, operated by the New Zealand Forest and Maritime Services, ran aground in January last year and was later refloated.

This weekend's incident saw the sinking of the SS Vavasa, a Finnish trawler, at 9pm, according to maritime rescue services at Johnshaven.

But the conditions were poor for a rescue by helicopter this time.

"It may be that there will be no survivors," Iain Young of Maritime Rescue, said. "The vessel has been at bottom for a long time. It could be very cold and there could be some gas issues. A helicopter would have difficulty approaching."

Mr Young said: "The vessel would be in 12 to 18ft of water so that means that divers would have to take over and there's no way that we would be able to access it. If we did think we had one person in the water, we could ask for help but we just don't want anything to interfere with an underwater recovery."

The incident occurred at around 9:30pm, when wind speed was recorded as between 15 knots and 30 knots.

The vessel, bound for Wick and heading south on the Minch, struck Johnshaven Harbour, just to the south of Johnshaven, two minutes later.

The weather was described as Force 5-6 with a Beaufort scale Force 3 wind blowing from the NE on the starboard side.

According to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the weather in the area was'very poor'
