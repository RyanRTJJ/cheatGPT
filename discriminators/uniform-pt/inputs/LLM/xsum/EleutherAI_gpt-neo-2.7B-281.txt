shire was killed in a firefight in Afghanistan on 30 May 2008.

Three soldiers were killed and another wounded by a firefight between Pte James and two Afghan insurgents, in the same patrol where Pte James was injured.

The Independent Mail was the first to report the details in 2008 of Pte James’s death as she carried out military operations in the Swat Valley, which is in Pakistan.

She was serving with 3 Rifles in Northumberland but had been working in the UK on the same day as the fight in the Swat Valley.

In 2008 I was appointed as a QC for the James’s family. The new inquest for Pte James is likely to last for several months.

For the first 15 weeks of the proceedings until the hearing begins, the inquest jury of nine will be made up almost exclusively of members of the military, which have the ultimate power of life and death over some of British’s finest soldiers. That is a clear indication of the seriousness of the case.

An inquest is like a trial in which evidence is given in the witnesses' own words or, until recently, read to them by the barrister or solicitor who acted, in this case, as deputy counsel to the James family in 2008.

In this case, the most important witness is Pte James herself whose testimony has been under intense scrutiny at the inquest.

Pte James was found dead with her hands bound behind her in the back of a pickup truck, in the Afghan village of Khwaja Khayam in early July 2008. She had been shot at close range in the head.

She has always insisted that she was the driver of the pickup. She was also believed to have fired the one shot which killed the two insurgents.

The inquest is likely to conclude soon that she acted in self-defence, but it cannot be entirely ruled out that she deliberately took on the two insurgents and died fighting them.

One is left to consider that if she acted in self-defence,
