A) said one of its members was injured in the riots and was taken to hospital for treatment.

One officer was treated for chest trauma and is currently in a stable condition.

Harrowing photographs released by the POA showed one inmate on fire inside the jail, with another being taken to a nearby hospital in a car after he sustained burns to his hands.

Prisons minister Rory Stewart condemned the violence in a statement and said the events were "unacceptable". He added that "concerns for the safety of both staff and inmates have been exacerbated by recent reports of serious violence at other prisons".

The Prison Service said the eight inmates had been involved in an "incident with their cellmate". The incident began when prison officers entered the offenders' unit to investigate the disturbance.

A Prison Service spokeswoman said the incident had not been a riot and did not involve inmates fighting with one another. "There were eight prisoners involved who acted in self defence during an isolated incident. None of those involved have links to any extremist activities," she said.

The POA also said one of its members had been hurt in the violent clashes. Prison officers had initially moved three inmates into restraint units. But two other inmates who were injured during the incident remained in the cellblock.

Speaking outside the prison, PoA's assistant general secretary, Howard Beckett, said: "Prison officers are absolutely furious about what has happened and rightly so. It was a really horrendous situation that unfolded at that prison. Officers were left in a horrible position."

He added that the conditions in which staff worked were not conducive to prisoner safety, describing conditions at Sheppey as "a disgrace". "The officers there have had a terrible experience," he said.

In his statement on Thursday evening, Mr Stewart said: "This despicable incident is unacceptable and I expect prisons to have robust management of prisoners and to protect against such acts of violence from prisoners within custody.
