ures Wales a first World Cup outing.

"The way we set off, we were a goal down with 19 players," said Gethin Jones, whose men have scored only once in their eight World Cup qualifying meetings with the Danes.

"Our forwards were chasing a lot of shadows and we just couldn't clear. When Geth had a chance to get a clear he should have done it and all of a sudden it was all over."

"We are outplayed for 60 minutes, that's how it feels."

The hosts took until the second half to find a breakthrough and their defence was exposed by the powerful free-kicks with the Danish midfield producing a devastating counter-attack.

Wales boss Jones said: "We had two goals to win and we didn't. They have a chance to win on penalties."

The match was settled by captain Scott Riddell's late strike to make the score 4-3 to Denmark, who were otherwise under pressure.

The Denmark players left their dressing room in floods of tears as they were given their marching orders by coach Michael Laudrup, who described their display as "very disappointing".

"When it went after the break, all of a sudden we knew we were going to lose by the end," said captain Simon Kjellin, who missed the Welsh opener through a serious injury.

The Danes boss said: "The team just wasn't very good in the first half, I'm not excusing what we're doing. We weren't good enough in defence."

But after the players were punished by a barrage of fouls and fouls were allowed in when there were a few players caught in a cross-fire, Laudrup warned his team they would have to improve if they wanted success in this month's World Cup qualifier.

"It's a very, very tough draw this time around and I'm certain we will improve in the next game if we play well in Doha," he said. "What happened in the first half was very disappointing. Our defence could have kept Denmark on the field. We are playing a man for man type
