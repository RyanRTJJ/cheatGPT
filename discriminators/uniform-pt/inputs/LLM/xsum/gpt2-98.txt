Bailey and another man were shot at around 3:30 a.m. July 17 in a downtown parking lot. The men remained in the car that had been driven by Combs' colleague, police said in a statement. He was shot and died at the scene.

Bailey's name didn't make it to the ballot in May, but Combs was cleared of any wrongdoing during the trial. After two years of deliberations, three jurors recommended that Combs be tried as a felon instead of a jailhouse robber.
