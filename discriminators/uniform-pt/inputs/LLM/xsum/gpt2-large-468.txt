 the exhibition's aim was to "teach people to go and explore their own personal space". She told the BBC she didn't want people coming to London just to see the artwork, but to "take part in becoming a part of a whole city in a different way".

The exhibition will feature more than 70 pieces of real world art, including the 1872 Leipzig work Battersea Power Station being transported into a virtual reality space. It's hoped the images can bring the original pieces into sharp focus and improve understanding of the artist and the work he did.

Tate Modern has previously opened its doors to VR for the company DreamWorks. There's already a number of VR experiences in the works, which are not currently available to the public.

As well as Tate Modern, VR works have been built in New York, Seattle and Amsterdam. VR works from Tate Modern will be installed in the Tate Modern Art Gallery in London.

Tate Modern is pleased to announce a partnership with the virtual reality (VR) studio Immersed to bring the exhibition of original original sculptures from Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid: Welcome to the Big Blue Oyster as an immersive VR experience to visitors to Tate Modern. Guests will be able to step into the Little Mermaid's adopted city in the Big Blue Oyster from the virtual world, exploring the real, physical locations which inspired the piece.

In the exhibition we will be exploring and explaining to guests the processes of building something, while also exploring the impact of these unique spaces on the characters or relationships that are built in there. We will explain to guests the way that the artist's work interacts with and reflects on the everyday life of his or her characters and the everyday activities they engage in. In addition we will create the opportunity for these interactions to be viewed in VR, allowing guests to experience Andersen's work
