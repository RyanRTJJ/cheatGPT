 unnecessary antibiotic treatments being given to patients, but also that this will be "a better indicator of who is getting their care in a timely manner and at what cost".

Patients must have a GP or consultant with an active NHS sign-in card, a letter of intent or a record of consultation if they expect an emergency.

The initiative will work to encourage patients to receive a consultation rather than just read a brochure on how to use medicine.

Dr Richard Hillman, director of the British Medical Association's public health division, said in a statement: "While we are all more aware of how the NHS operates today, it's important to remember the vast array of services it provides - ranging from GP appointments to surgery to maternity units – today is no different.

"Many of us have always carried a mobile phone – and we should always carry medicine."

In the same statement, the BMA welcomed the government's plans to help people access the internet without the help of a PC.

The initiative will have a four-month trial phase, with a first batch of patients joining in the first half of October.

The scheme may also be rolled out to other areas, NHS England said.

There were 7.2m prescriptions written for antibiotics last year, so the scheme will help reduce antibiotic use by 7 per cent.

Patients must be given a booklet after a test to show how they can use the medication safely.

NHS England said it is targeting about 590 general practitioners in Birmingham, 845 in the Vale of Glamorgan and 740 in Cambridgeshire, so by the end of 2020 it expects all doctors will be prepared to sign on to help avoid unnecessary treatments.

The NHS also plans to open up the digital health card to help patients pay for their prescriptions, which it said is increasingly expensive.

NHS England also has to work out how to provide more specialist care for people with multiple conditions so it can cut costs, it said.
