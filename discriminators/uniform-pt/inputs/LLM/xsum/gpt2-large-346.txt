 was still impressed with the way his players played in Barcelona's 3-2 win at Camp Nou on Saturday.

"We have shown in the past that we are very ambitious with the squad we have at the moment," Mourinho said. "I think this is the time to get a big winning streak going and take our place.

"We should be proud of the way we played before and now on Saturday."

Mourinho refused to criticise his side's early exit from the Copa del Rey, though they could be without the injury-capped Costa, who underwent surgery late on Saturday for an ankle injury.

"He recovered and took two days or three days to recover," said Mourinho of Costa. "Because of everything after the international break, we had a lot of doubts because of his absence. It was only a couple of days before he feels well again."

Mourinho has revealed that Costa could play again this weekend if he feels the need. The Portugal midfielder was a late withdrawal for the Nou Camp tie with Benfica last week, but Mourinho believes Costa's experience should mean he is more suited for the Clasico.

"In the game in Portugal, I played for 13 minutes," he said. "Before this game, I played for 48 minutes. We have to know to ask his doctor and see whether he is ready to play. He was injured in a game. What about in the game now? We don't know; we have to wait until next week.

"I remember once that in the dressing room I was on my knees talking with him [Luis Figo] and he was on his knees too, while everybody was laughing very very many minutes."
