horrendous". However the BBC spoke to three teachers who said they hoped the change would be swift and that pupils at their school would have a chance to gain a broader understanding of the current curriculum. The rest of the teachers involved said they were now "concerned, frightened, but hopeful".

They said they had received word from some education figures that parents felt "too scared" to educate their children. But none of the teachers said they expected any change at school for the rest of the year.

"It's really awful. It's been the worst year of our schools," said one woman from the Birmingham area who told BBC Radio 5 Live that she was frustrated the change would be swift.

The most popular schools are in London, Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds, as well as the Yorkshire and the Humber, Birmingham, Liverpool City centre and Manchester city centres.

The BBC contacted all the schools involved for comment and we have yet to receive any back-of-the-envelope response.

In an email sent after the change, senior teaching authority officials said the changes were being implemented within
