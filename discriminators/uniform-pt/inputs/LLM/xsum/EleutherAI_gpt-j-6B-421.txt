 BBC Arabic service quotes Tehran on Thursday as reporting that Iran "had sent" the unmanned US drone to an airfield but as not yet landing it on the island or the runway. The government statement claimed the test had been "successful".

Iran says it has sent the drone to the Gulf, but it is not clear why Iran chose this moment to launch a new test. The US military has said that it will not comment on the "specific location and timing of Iranian test flights" but that it considers Iran's test of an armed drone on Wednesday as a violation of its obligations under the UN charter.

The US insists that Iran is in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1929. And it will remain so unless Iran "stops all enrichment-related activities," stops developing missiles and ends cooperation with other nations, among other measures.

In response to a question from Al-Monitor during a press conference in Ankara, Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said: "Iran's test run is a reaction to the latest step taken by [the] United States, which is against Iran's air space sovereignty. This is an unfair act on the part of the United States. The test was conducted in accordance with Iran's defence policy and in line with our plans."

During an interview with BBC Persian late last year, Mr Dehghan said Iran has the "right to conduct its own tests and flights" for its own air defence. "It must be noted that this test is in line with our defence doctrine and Iran's defense and security plans and we would not allow anyone to intrude in our defence affairs," he added.

The Iranian missile and unmanned aircraft programme has been described by officials as an “existential” threat by Iranian media. But Iranian lawmakers reacted to the US test on Wednesday by saying that the country has used “limited force to deter war,” and that it “welcomed the opportunity to test [the drone],” according to a report in Al-Monitor quoting Iranian media reports (Sept 17, 2018) and quoting parliamentary news services.
