 team to Matthew Wade and is batting slightly below 100.

"I'm going to make the best of it, I've got no intention of changing my batting," Hameed said earlier this month.

"My bat has helped me get through first-class cricket in the Premier League and it helps me keep bowling to bowlers outside their comfort zones.

"I am a good open bowler, my form's there and I don't miss bats down any ball. I don't care what spinners are out there; if I make a play to the off side of the pitch, that's a one-run win."

India's selectors are set to unveil their squad before the second day of the tournament and while the home side have two-wicket partnerships ahead, most of those are composed of men such as Smith, Hameed and R Ashwin.

India's squad: Mitchell Starc, Rohit Sharma, Hashim Amla, Sarfraz Ahmed, Sunil Gavaskar, Sarfraz Ahmed (capt), Ashwin, S Sreesanth, Amjad Quaderi, Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin, Smith (wk), Alastair Cook, Ravindra Jadeja
