 to switch from a high-fat, high-fibre diet.

The researchers found that overweight and obese Americans lost as much as 4.7 kg in the first month on the diet.

But they did not lose as much in the second month of the experiment.

The US volunteers felt less hungry on the diet and their metabolism was increased.

Some of the volunteers also said that they were able to work out more.

The changes were not seen in the Africans - and they also lost less weight.

The team said they can not explain what differences in the diets led to the different results.

They found that the Americans lost more water weight and fat, but most of the Africans lost more body fat, muscle mass and muscle mass.

Dr. Linda S. Chia, a member of the research team from the University of Colorado at Boulder, who carried out the study, told Reuters Health: "The Africans were able to do 20% more exercise on this diet than on the diet that was used to measure the blood lipids, which gives a great idea of how much energy is being used in the body".

The results show that this is something the participants would benefit from, she said.

"It is about helping the people to go back into a more balanced and healthy diet, to find some of the lifestyle changes they may need to do themselves, and we are giving them a tool to do that".

Linda Chia, co-author of the paper published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition:

"This study was more realistic in nature. It's a group where most people are overweight or obese, as opposed to a study where you're comparing like-for-like. That makes it easier to see the results of the diets".

Researchers said that when low levels of iron are present the body uses more oxygen to carry out metabolic processes, which raises blood cholesterol levels - this is known as oxidative stress.

While this increase is small in the population studied in this study, it's thought to play a role in the
