 undergo a psychiatric assessment and will be in the community for a week. There are also allegations of mental health issues at the school, as well as threats.

Police say Mandy and two friends allegedly set fire to an apartment building. A number of houses near the building were knocked over and the windows smashed.

Two people including a 17-year-old woman were injured, aged in their teens and in their 20s. Mandy was arrested and charged with seven offences. Her family insists she is suffering from depression, and says that if she returns to school she is not allowed to attend. Police hope more people can be affected by this incident.

Mandy is due in court on Thursday. When they arrive, they will be shown images of the burnt-out building and the injuries the students have caused, as well as further interviews with the perpetrators.

The group will return later for a hearing in January.

Mandy Dunford is accused of shooting two people in her home outside Edinburgh in 2011. Mandy was in Edinburgh to witness two students get hold of explosives and then take them from her home. A fourth person, aged 19, and a 20-year-old student were also shot, police said. One of the boys was in a wheelchair, and his body was found the following day.
