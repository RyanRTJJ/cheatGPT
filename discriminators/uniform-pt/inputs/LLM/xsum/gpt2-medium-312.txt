 EU if negotiations went ahead without the UK.

Fault: EU rules prevent countries from passing laws that affect people who currently live in the EU for longer than six months.

The claim: People who work in an EU state would continue to be entitled to national living expenses for at least six months regardless of whether they live in the EU for more than five years.

Fault: EU rules allow countries to set national living allowances for their citizens for four years even if they work for someone else, so it would not change for anyone who worked for themselves for at least five years.

The claim: European Union citizens who receive EU subsidies are entitled to a €37,000 annual pension contribution, after 20 or 25 years (which the government said would be triggered under a Brexit deal). The EU would also set up a retirement scheme for anyone from EU member states who want to work.

Fault: The rules say the pension contribution should be paid first, but the government said the bill would be payable later because of the EU's budget, which excludes some EU citizens and people with medical conditions. The prime minister claimed that he would not force such people to pay until he got an agreement with Brussels, but he eventually agreed to do so.

Why are there EU subsidies?

The European Commission says the EU's budget for 2015-2019 is €3.6bn a year, but it does not include the amount it earmarks for the EU's budget.

For instance, most of the EU's agricultural subsidies are paid through bilateral agreements between governments – such as the European Commission – and their partners in the WTO – such as the UK.

The EU's food subsidies go to member states, meaning they may not qualify for these for their countries if they are outside of the EU, such as Belgium and Luxembourg. Countries outside of the EU that are free trade partners enjoy several other sources of help from the EU's agricultural budget – for example, the European Commission may issue a green stamp stamp of approval, which is a seal with the EU emblem.

Some EU member states may also have direct agreements with other governments that can get a similar payment on their own. This is to ensure that certain products, such
