McBride - an engineering consultant with the company - said the project would also see future missions built with the UK's new ExoMars vehicle.

Britain is preparing to launch its exoMars probe to Mars this September, and is the first member of the European Space Agency (ESA) to land on the Red Planet after the programme's own ExoMars 2016 plan was scrapped last year, due to budget cuts.

"ExoMars will take our hopes of visiting another world up a notch with the success that we have had on exoskeletons for our own planets since 1998," said David Shuker, the UK's space minister and exoMars 2017 mission coordinator, in announcing the investment.

The ESA will continue to deliver Mars missions to the International Space Station and Mars rover missions with Russia until 2020.

British Aerospace (BAe) has been working on an ExoMars vehicle since 2001, and now employs 150 engineers and is building and test-driving the technology in two of the vehicle's seven ExoMars modules.

McBride said the UK has two major advantages over most other nations in space technology: "One is, we are actually doing space station missions.

"And we can deliver them back to Earth in the form of satellites, rather than ship them around the world. This is going to help support this new generation of UK space agencies."

UK space agencies including the European Space Agency (ESA), Britain's Royal Space Society (RSS) and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd are to bid for the 2017 module.

The bid for that module takes place next year and aims to create a permanent space station crew home for a crewed mission and launch vehicle to fly to Mars. The Â£6m investment would be spread between the company and SASL as well as Britain's Department of ExoMars.

The announcement came just a week after an American company launched its own ExoMars probe for Nasa and a Chinese company last month also announced it had been approached for a similar mission.

A team from the ExoMars programme will arrive in France on December 18 from Nasa's Space Launch System launch centre. The probe will be docked at the France-based Astrium space centre near Marse
