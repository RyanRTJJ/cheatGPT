 from eight EU countries – Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Cyprus, Malta, Spain, Portugal and UK – only.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air France flights to the US, the Transport Minister said:

"We can't do anything on this front, because from Paris to New York we are flying to a third country, so that is not a priority."

His comments contradicted the stance of Minister of Transport Guy de La Tourette, who earlier said that French transport officials would decide soon if the ban would continue while the "legal and logistical hurdles" remained.

"It's a question of timing," the government spokesman said. "On the one hand, we need to consider the measures that will be necessary in order to prevent security breaches. On the other hand, there is no point in banning all laptops on board unless we are in fact at risk of a serious incident that requires urgent evacuations of the aircraft."

De La Tourette had also suggested that if the laptop ban was not lifted from the three affected countries, the ban on laptops in all cabins might be extended.

The French ministers' statement had previously been criticised by the European Commission, which said that the move could cost at least €1 billion in lost revenues. Following the announcement, the Commission said that it would "actively support the US administration if this proposal is adopted by the United States and not put forward by France."

The commission also pointed out that there were four other non-EU airports – including London Heathrow and Chicago O'Hare – capable of landing passengers who need to carry laptops on board.

"It is also possible that if and when the EU legislation becomes obligatory with respect to all airlines operating from the US, then non-EU pilots will be obliged to carry tablets or other laptops in their cabins," said European Commission spokesperson Nathalie Kosciusko said in a statement.
