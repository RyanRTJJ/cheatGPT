, but has also been found in other animals and in humans. The WHO says Zika infection has been confirmed in more than 25 cases in the region, with four of those in Brazil, where the outbreak originated. While it is unclear exactly how Zika virus is transmitted, the UN health agency says in a statement that its investigation into the connection "remains ongoing and is expected to continue until at least end of this month".

'Zika could disrupt development' The WHO's statement came as the agency raised its global alert level on the disease to "high" -- the highest, the agency said. It said the alert is a response to "information from countries and other partners concerning outbreaks of Zika virus infection with severe or fatal congenital brain defects and microcephaly". The alert affects a much larger number of people than the usual alert level set for a specific disease for the international health system. The WHO said it was particularly concerned about how Zika could disrupt the ongoing development of babies. "Newborn babies are particularly vulnerable to brain development defects from birth abnormalities like microcephaly," it said. 'Very serious' Dr Michael Ryan, head of the WHO health emergencies programme, said there were concerns the Zika virus could set off a "fatal domino effect" on the health of babies because of associated birth defects.

Brazil reports rise in microcephaly cases The WHO said there was no evidence to suggest these conditions were "directly attributable to Zika infection". It added that while there was "unquestionable and very serious evidence" of the link, it had received conflicting advice from several governments. This, WHO chief Margaret Chan said, was a "very good example of the need for better guidance". "While we do not have enough scientific evidence to completely rule out the possibility – which is clearly an extremely serious concern – the evidence as it stands supports a very strong presumption that Zika virus infection can cause severe congenital defects," she said. Scientists believe the current
