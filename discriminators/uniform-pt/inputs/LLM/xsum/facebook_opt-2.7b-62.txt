Mark Keary is an independent tutor in education at the school. He also said he disagreed with the assessment.

‘I have been here 12 years now,’ he said. ‘I’ve had to deal with parents, teachers and the council in every facet of the school. It’s just not true.’

Last month schools minister Nick Boles launched an inquiry into the teaching of ‘learning difficulties’ after it was revealed a £60 million project to introduce ‘academically focused’ mainstream education is not helping those with ASD (autism spectrum disorder).

As it turned out, the report into Green Spring Academy was commissioned by the Education Funding Agency, which runs special education.

This article was amended on 23 March 2015 to clarify the source of the report into Green Spring Academy. The full report was commissioned by the Education Funding Agency, which runs school special education.
