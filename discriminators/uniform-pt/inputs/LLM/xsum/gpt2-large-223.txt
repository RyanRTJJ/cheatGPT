 Now they've spotted it, too. If it's not a treasure then, it is an important scientific find, and it's not a bad time to be making waves.

But what's interesting is the context of this find. The sonar pictures are from March 2014, which is a year after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that there was a massive pulse on the ocean floor over the Gulf of California: a pulse of methane.

In the end, the gas that's floating comes out of the seafloor under the surface of the Gulf of California, on beaches like Ventura, Santa Barbara, and Boca Chica in Southern California, along the coast of Northern California around the San Andreas Fault, and in the depths of the ocean off Baja California.

When researchers first detected the methane signal, the gas was a lot larger than it has been in recent years, in the region of 5,000 parts per billion.

That means that if this new methane pulse had a high enough energy density – a metric used to measure whether an event such as this is an earthquake – then it would be detectable over the entire world. The pulse is on the seafloor, on land, in the ocean, and it has been since March 2014.

The NOAA has been keeping track of a few different methane pulses over the past three years, and now they've announced these recent observations.

We now know that there's been a massive emission of methane off the coast of South America for over three years, and not a single researcher – or anyone who was not deliberately trying to confuse experts – thought it would be coming from offshore oil rigs.

And the biggest mystery still hasn't been solved: why are there so many earthquakes offshore?

"The biggest mystery still hasn't been solved"

The first question that will remain unanswered, after this new discovery is complete, is the mystery for which the Pacific Ocean looks like a black hole – that the emissions come from under the ocean, that there are no oil rigs off the coast of California, no oil spills, and no fracking.

One key piece of evidence is a series of earthquakes off the coast of Alaska (the
