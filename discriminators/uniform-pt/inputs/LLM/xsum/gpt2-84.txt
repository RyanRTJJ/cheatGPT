, the disease has been described as being caused by a combination of both Lyme and Lyme-related factors.

"Despite the increased emphasis on the public health problems associated with tick bites and associated infections, there is still evidence that a high rate of Lyme disease occurs in a single individual through direct tick exposure," says Rolfe Bouchard, M.D., the head of the research group on Lyme disease at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

"For example, when ticks are on humans, they produce the toxin Lyme, which is a marker of Lyme-like symptoms. A link was found between Lyme disease and tick transmission and the amount of the infectious agent [bacterium Bacterioceles] that can transmit the illness."

In 2007, scientists found that Lyme disease can be contracted from direct tick contact with humans, including tickbite fever caused by exposure to the tick's tick-infested skin. Lyme disease can increase transmission to humans on contaminated surfaces in the human body, but the CDC recommends that people be careful not to transmit this disease to anyone who is close to the area with their tick or who is bitten by ticks. Tick bites typically last a few minutes and can be extremely painful and may start to get worse after a few days.

If you've ever experienced an infection of your tick, contact your health department immediately. If you've ever had a tick bite, contact your doctor immediately and provide written medical history before contact. If you've ever gotten pregnant when someone infected an infected pet and you haven't received medical care immediately after, call the Centers for Disease Control or find your local CDC office right now.

"By monitoring your pet's tick-borne transmission, you can help protect your pet from ticks, prevent infection or avoid the development of disease," recalls Dr. John Van Der Veen, M.D., who is the M.D.: "If you have your tick in your pet's home as well as an infected pet's, you may be at the forefront of the fight against it.

"Your pet's tickborne transmission by being in the home or in your pet's household is highly contagious â€” and your pet may live up to 20 years on the
