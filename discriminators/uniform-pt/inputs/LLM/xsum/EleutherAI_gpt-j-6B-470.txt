 her “discreditable conduct”.

Ms Walsh, who also works as a school counsellor, has been charged with gross misconduct by teaching standards investigators at the Scottish Qualifications Authority.

She has denied wrongdoing. She was suspended as a result of a formal investigation by SCAE, the education inspector in Scotland. The union, Unison, said it was shocked Ms Walsh had been suspended. It said it is calling for an early decision to be made about her future to prevent further suffering.

Ms Walsh, a university student, became involved in the online campaign, which was reported on yesterday by Scotland’s Herald newspaper, after receiving a series of abusive letters in 2014. She has been suspended without pay since then.

The petition, which is at Change.org, states: “We, the undersigned, are calling on the management at the Scottish Qualifications Authority, SCAE (Scotland’s Education and Skills Inspectorate) to expedite any decision or action regarding Ms Walsh’s employment and her future based on her denial of alleged gross misconduct, and in the interests of fairness and public protection.

“We are sick of being lectured about the rights and wrongs of the situation, we have every right to express an opinion (as Ms Walsh’s employer), but the situation should not have ended up involving law enforcement.

“We believe SCAE’s role should be to establish what the evidence is against Ms Walsh and to provide an impartial view of the situation. We are calling for Ms Walsh to be reinstated as a staff member before she is charged with criminal offences.”

The petition currently has 7,600 signatures and a further 13,000 requests that the government act. A Unison organiser, who joined the campaign last week, said Ms Walsh’s employers were keeping her “in the dark” about the investigation’s outcome.

They also said it was important to ensure Ms Walsh was reinstated as a school employee before she was charged with any criminal offences.

In response to the petition, SCAE confirmed it had been approached by the union, which is the legal representative of Ms Walsh.

A spokeswoman said: “
