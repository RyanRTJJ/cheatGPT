 Kenya being conducted in Somalia "amount to an attack on all Somali people".

Al-Shabab, the militant Islamic group in Somalia, has long labeled the deployment of Kenyan troops in Somalia since 2011 as an occupation. This is in part because the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) is aimed at creating an effective government that has been seen by some Somalis as backed by foreign forces. Al-Shabab has often sought to frame the presence of international forces in Somalia in terms of military occupation, as seen in its claims that recent air strikes conducted by Kenyan forces in Somalia are an attack on all Somalis. Al-Shabab justifies its opposition to the presence of Kenyan forces and the AMISOM mission by stating that it violates Somalia's sovereignty and undermines the independence of the Somali people.
