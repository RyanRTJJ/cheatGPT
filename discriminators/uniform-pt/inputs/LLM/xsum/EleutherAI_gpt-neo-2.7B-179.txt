 in fighting US and NATO forces in Afghanistan.

The move comes months after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the country it would get its long-time warlord "over the line".

Mr Pompeo met with the country's top leadership over a two-day visit in Kabul and told Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in a letter that Hekmatyar had "destroyed his credibility and he cannot hide behind any Afghan politician".

Mr Pompeo said America's security partners would need to work "to ensure they no longer receive support from Hekmatyar or anyone associated with him, or from those groups who receive aid from the Haqqani network, or from those who use his tactics and continue to use his name to further their cause".

The US has been carrying out air raids against militant hideouts and in the eastern province of Nangarhar in recent weeks.

On Tuesday, US and Afghan forces carried out an air strike against a group "identified as being in Hekmatyar's vicinity" in an area of the province called Nahr-e Saraj district.

Mr Trump has made the warlord's name his campaign theme in the election.

The president has been trying to paint his opponent as un-American when he ran on the promise of ending the war in Afghanistan, and he continues to point to the war as evidence he is winning.

However, in a statement announcing his travel plans on Monday, Vice President Mike Pence said the US would remain involved in Afghanistan long after the end of the scheduled NATO withdrawal in December.

The move appears to be aimed at staking out territory around Hekmatyar's territory as well as on his organisation's presence in areas where the US is conducting operations against ISIS remnants.
