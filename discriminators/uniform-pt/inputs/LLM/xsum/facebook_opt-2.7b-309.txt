"I pay an income tax every year and I've paid it all my life," Mr Buffett said in a television interview on Monday with Fox Business Network.

The billionaire investor also criticised Mr Trump's proposed tax on US companies taking profits offshored to lower-tax countries such as Ireland.

"I think that's just an insult to every business person in this country," Mr Buffett said.

He added that he had no concern about the amount of overseas profits that companies would pay if the Republican nominee became president.

"I pay a very high income tax just living in this house, " he said, referring to his Berkshire Hathaway home in Omaha, Nebraska. "The guy has no idea what the hell they would do to me."

The debate marked Mr Trump's first face-to-face clash with a Democrat candidate since Mr Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, took on President Barack Obama in the 2012 election.

Mr Trump accused Mr Buffett and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of being "not paying taxes" and of not "volunteering". According to estimates by the US Treasury, Mr Buffett paid roughly $3.2 billion in federal income taxes in 2014, or 22.7 percent of his net worth.

The Republican was criticised earlier this month by the National Association of Homebuilders for saying that US companies should "start moving their headquarters back to the US" or face a 25 percent tax.

At the same debate, Mr Trump also suggested that Mr Buffett had done something bad.

"I'm giving a lot of money away and I'm talking about Buffett. I remember he gave about $5bn to the Clinton Foundation," Mr Trump said. "So am I going to hold him to a standard that doesn't really exist?"

He added: "He gets $38.5 billion — $38.5 billion in assets, $38.5 billion in a couple of accounts — and he pays none of that in income taxes. So you're paying taxes on assets that you don't have to pay taxes on."

The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
