 against the Taliban.

"This is a major blow to Hekmatyar's fighters in Afghanistan."

Mr Hekmatyar's supporters described it as an act of treachery, adding they would fight.

The Taliban have said they will not halt fighting over this issue and also want the US to withdraw its forces.

"In Afghanistan, it is not possible because Afghans have had enough of America," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.

In the latest assault on Hekmatyar's forces, militants captured 11 men in the area of Sherzad, south of Kabul.

After the deal, the US has lifted sanctions on Mr Hekmatyar. But he has refused to condemn the Taliban in public or take part in peace talks.
