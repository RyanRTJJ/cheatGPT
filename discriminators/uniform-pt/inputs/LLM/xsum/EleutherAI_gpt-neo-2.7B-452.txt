Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said: "The government should not be pursuing a reckless course of action that will only destroy our planet."

The Conservatives also promised to back Labour's pledge to hold a public consultation on nuclear power, which aims to replace nuclear power with energy from renewable sources by the power of 50%.

With less than three weeks to go in Parliament before MPs vote on whether to suspend parliament over the government's Brexit strategy, Mr Johnson is facing increasing pressure from his own party to get Brexit Britain on track.
