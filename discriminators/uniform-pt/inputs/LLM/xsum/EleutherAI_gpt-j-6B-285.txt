 unsure how to fix it.

For one thing Mercedes suffered from an initial pit-stop problem which could be linked to the team missing an assembly in Russia.

"We didn't do so bad in Russia but we struggled the rest of the year," Horner told Sky Sports News.

"I don't think the rules changed much. I think it was just a factor of us. For example [this race] we could have been a bit off it."

However this weekend's action is different - Renault were the dominant team in Hungary without having to deal with a reliability problem or a grid drop which would mean missing a race.

"We weren't so strong [here last time]," says Horner, "but our problems are more apparent because of that. We just went quicker."

But not as quick as Mercedes who, in the words of Lewis Hamilton, "deserve whatever they get at the end of the season".

They did lose pole to Red Bull, although it was for the wrong reason - Ricciardo was ordered to move over and overtake the Toro Rosso.

Horner says this race has shown Mercedes can be more of an all-round package as the season goes on.

"They're obviously quick but we've not seen that since Monaco," adds Horner.

"They've won some grands prix, some very famous ones, you know Singapore in the past but this year we haven't seen them as dominant as we've seen before."

What happens in Monaco?

But the FOM tracker shows Mercedes are not only more of an all-round package, they are also out-performing their rivals.

Ahead of the race, they were just five points behind Red Bull in both the drivers' and constructors' championships making them one point clear of third-placed Ferrari, 12 apart of Mercedes in fourth and five points better than their nearest rivals Williams.

Of course this isn't an accurate guide of where things will finish up but it is something to hang on to.

What happens in Monaco?

It won't all run smoothly though and it comes as the teams prepare for their Monaco Grand Prix.
