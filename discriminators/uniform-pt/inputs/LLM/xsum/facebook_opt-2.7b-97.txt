 type of fake news and I hope they're sued for it. I'm taking legal action to stop this, in the public interest."

"Their publication of the story caused me irreparable harm," he continued. "I had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to get justice, and their conduct cost me my jobs, my reputation and my ability to work with other people. I had no choice but to seek justice."

According to News Corp, which owns Fox News, there was a lawsuit filed on Wednesday but did not go into details. Representatives will not make the company available for further comment.

CNN has reached out to Lauer and Mehta for comment on the lawsuit.

The lawsuit comes one day after the network's parent company, News Corp, announced that chairman and CEO Robert Thomson would be retiring early and be replaced by Chase Carey.

Last month, NBC fired Lauer, the host of Today since its launch in 1985, after he made a "conscious decision" that he have consensual sex with a female colleague "while she was asleep." Lauer later apologized for having "engaged in significant drunken behavior" with another woman not involved in sexual misconduct accusations against him, NBC said in a letter addressed to the company.

While the complaint has no bearing on Mehta's role at Good Morning America, it is expected that those complaints will be made available to Carey and his board of directors, reports Variety.
