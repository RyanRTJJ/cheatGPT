 work with purchases of 20p and under.

While most items are eligible for the service, some products including alcohol, cigarettes, and some medical items — such as medication — will not be available to order.

It said the move, which will come into effect on 6 January, is made to "ensure our customers can access the most popular items and offer them at the price they want".

The online retailer is not offering the service for some products, such as household utensils and food, whose prices are set by department stores.

Its decision makes a particular point about offering cheaper prices for customers in parts of the country where prices are high.

Many shoppers have complained that Amazon is not offering the same range of products as some high street retailers.

Online ordering has been growing fast since it started making its own goods in 2011.

In an interview with The Spectator newspaper, the retailer's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said he hoped it would take off in "every household, every town".

He said: "If the UK is going to be a competitive global economy, I don't think we can have one dominant retailer."

However, the move will anger some customers as well as those who wish to buy other things on Amazon instead of paying for it on a weekly, monthly or annual basis.

It will also be seen as a way of boosting Amazon's growth in Europe, where it has failed to make a significant impact.

Mr Bezos was initially skeptical of the e-commerce firm, but he has since invested about £1bn and opened the company's first fulfillment centres in Germany and Italy.

He also announced last month that the UK should be the front-runner among European nations when it comes to the use of the technology.

The company has said that the e-commerce giant is already shipping products to Britain from warehouse to shelves.

The deal to raise the "super saver delivery" price is yet to be finalised.

A spokesman for Amazon said it remains "committed to working with every retailer to ensure the broadest possible range of products are available to our customers" where
