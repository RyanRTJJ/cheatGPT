 responsible for some of the highest operative mortality, and it appears from these new figures that one of their names was Dr David Cope-Foster. In order to fully understand why Cope-Foster’s reputation among surgeons and academics is now in a free-fall, you need to have some familiarity with the work that is the reason for his high mortality rate.

As I have explained before, all the medical specialties are divided up into hierarchies. These hierarchies often have a simple, obvious name such as “surgeons” or “nurses”, but behind the name lies a more complicated arrangement of duties and responsibilities. To begin with, surgeons are the specialists who are able to operate on the various parts of the body. Surgeons also have a huge number of subsidiary duties such as looking after hospital patients, reviewing their outcomes and dealing with the many problems that arise from the human body.

As any medical student who has been forced to suffer through a series of lectures explaining this whole process is aware, the hierarchies are not static - people can fall and rise in status as their medical experience and skill increases or decreases. Indeed, it is precisely this aspect of hierarchy that Dr Cope-Foster is now trying to contest. You may recall that last year he published a paper in BMJ claiming that he was responsible for performing a record amount of surgery on blood vessels.

This was based on the claim that the rates of these procedures had been increasing steadily in the UK since the early 1990s, along with the idea that this meant that more and more surgeons had been “specialising” in blood vessel operations.

I thought that his claim was simply untrue, based on this review and the following one by Dr Robert Jones. However, Jones is a specialist who operates on blood vessels, so you can understand why people tend to think that he might be biased in some way.

In both cases, Jones looked at all the data and concluded that Dr Cope-Foster’s claims were untrue. Unfortunately, he was unable to make sense
