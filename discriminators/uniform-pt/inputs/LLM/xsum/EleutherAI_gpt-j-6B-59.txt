 British Government to release records relating to the creation of the republic.

The new UK-run EU Commission, in addition to conducting its normal business, is expected to play a role in preparing for the UK's exit from the EU.

Ahead of talks with Mr Schulz over Wednesday's summit, Mr Cameron said: "It's vital that in those discussions we don't allow ourselves to get distracted by the things that separate us from each other, by the things that divide people in Europe.

"Let's keep our eyes on the big prize and make the case for what we can do in common: building a strong, safer, reformed and more prosperous European Union."

Mr Cameron said Mr Obama was "a strong ally" of the UK and the EU during the talks as it tries to win his help in getting a better trade deal with the US by the end of this year.

Mr Cameron thanked the US president for his help in pushing ahead with Britain's withdrawal. He also hailed Mrs Merkel's statement, saying that, "I am glad that you have come out so frankly, I wish my own cabinet had been prepared to be as frank as you are".

He has come under pressure from Conservative MPs to explain how he will ensure the UK and the EU avoid a cliffhanger in negotiating the country out of the EU. There have been fears the two sides could run up against a time limit of March 2019, when the UK is due to leave.

In response to the US president, Mr Cameron said he would also raise with Mr Obama concerns about the treatment of the Syrian refugees. Mrs Merkel also pledged to discuss the issue at a meeting with Mr Cameron later on Thursday.
