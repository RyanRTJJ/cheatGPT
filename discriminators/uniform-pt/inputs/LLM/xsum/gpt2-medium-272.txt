, while he will say that government should be more concerned with ensuring services are fit for purpose.

Mr Corbyn has said Labour could "end the disgrace of council tax cuts that impoverish thousands of families" by leaving the state-owned public sector to run services.

In a speech on Thursday, he has confirmed he will announce changes to the Labour manifesto with "great vigour" in the wake of the election defeat.

On Wednesday, Labour will commit to leaving the UK's second-biggest debt in surplus, but will retain the £48bn set aside to help cities and towns balance the budget in the next Parliament, when spending is likely to hit £120 billion.

As well as devolving power over planning to regional councils, Mr Corbyn will also say that government will take responsibility for ensuring public services are the best they can be, and that more is being done to make them more accountable.

He will promise to raise £10bn a year by abolishing council tax and scrapping the housing benefit cap in April 2017. Mr Corbyn has told a meeting of a senior business lobby group (BALO) that the party is committed to saving tax for businesses and workers.

But he did not say how much of that money would come from cuts to VAT, but warned there would be "serious costs" imposed.

He told delegates there were two issues facing Labour - "taxation policy and growth".

The party's election victory suggests it has found room for growth in areas where Labour missed out by a long way - from inner cities to education to immigration. However, Mr Corbyn did not outline specifics on his manifesto pledges to help young people.

However, he made clear he wanted Mr Clegg to leave office early "so he can look at what a legacy this will be or help deliver the next government."
