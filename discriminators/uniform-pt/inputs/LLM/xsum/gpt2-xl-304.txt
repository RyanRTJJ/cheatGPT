 earlier said it was also looking into reports that Russian aircraft had shot at Syrian air defences.

The defence ministry said its radar at Hmeimim detected at least two aircraft approaching the Syrian coast on Tuesday, including two Tu-22M3 long-range bombers and two Su-33 long-range fighter-bombers. Russian planes are known to operate from Hmeimim, and it is the first time Nato officials have publicly acknowledged that an aircraft had been scrambled from the base by Russian special forces.

Nato diplomats in Brussels had earlier told Reuters that Russia had deployed Su-33s at Hmeimim to patrol in Syrian airspace and support its campaign of air strikes against Isis, but had not confirmed whether Russian special forces had been operating there.

Nato officials have also said they have intelligence that Russia plans to increase troop numbers in Syria and increased the number of aircraft and helicopters in central Syrian air space.

"Russia has increased its number of aircraft deployed near, or to, the [Syrian coast], including a number of air-launched cruise missiles and additional long-range aviation," the Nato statement said. "Russian aircraft have conducted air strikes against forces fighting the Syrian government, including the so-called Islamic State, which the Russian defence ministry says are controlled by the terrorists."

Nato has also warned Russia that, if it does not respect the territorial integrity of Syria and its coalition air strikes, the alliance will take action. While Russia says it has targeted Islamic State but not the al-Qaida affiliated Nusra, the coalition said Russian jets were repeatedly flying over areas of eastern Aleppo held by Nusra so "that Nusra may know they are being attacked".

Nato has stepped up its air operations in Syria in recent weeks, and has said it is on the verge of completing its bombing campaign of pro-government forces in Syria, though it has not said for which rebel units it is targeting. The Russian air strikes, which it began last September, have
