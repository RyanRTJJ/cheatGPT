ics have all agreed with us that it is worth playing. We are doing it for the right reasons. It's only just a matter of time now."

Gatland said that the "consequences of an injury like that" were "absolutely horrific", but added the Ospreys would be better placed to recover from it "in the same way" as those who were injured playing cricket during the first Tests of the World Cup.

The news of Ospreys flanker Rhys Rudd's return to training was greeted with euphoria in the rugby community, with Welsh fans at the Liberty Stadium's North Stand screaming and jumping with delight after hearing the news at around 2am local time (5am BST).

Rudd returned to training straight from the hospital and said he would enjoy his rugby again by playing his rugby against Scotland on Saturday.

The 27-year-old was taken from his home in London with the injured ankle on July 4 and underwent an operation on Wednesday. He has been kept overnight in hospital and was expected to continue with the team on Friday until his next surgery.

Despite being treated for fractures, bruising and severe swelling, Rudd has taken in training for the first time since the surgery and appeared in an Ospreys full colour TV commercial for GloBike which was released earlier on Friday morning.

Gatland said: "He's in training and it's not bad. He's got a little bit of swelling. It was really, really tough on him last night so we hope [he's going to] play tomorrow."

The Lions tour of New Zealand to be preceded by Wales tests against the Springboks, Argentina and Australia will take place between August 1-9.

Gatland said: "Hopefully we can put a good showing together. This has given the team an opportunity to take it to some really big venues.
