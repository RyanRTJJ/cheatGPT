BT and Verizon are competing to build the UK's biggest mobile network. BT's plans for its mobile broadband network and its deal to provide its mobile network to Verizon have been approved by the regulator Ofcom, which will run the network, providing it also operates the national grid and other services. BT said the network is expected to be up and running by 2013, and it aims to have 60 million customers by that time.

BT had originally proposed to provide its mobile network to Openreach and Vodafone, although the two companies later dropped their involvement.

In other areas, BT has won the prestigious Queen's Award for Enterprise. Its plans for a new 1,900mbyte fibre network over land to connect London, Birmingham and Manchester were granted planning permission. The fibre optic cable will have between 10 and 20 miles of capacity, giving BT access to much of the country and providing a "network for the future" for mobile, broadband and telephone services. BT said it will help stimulate new technologies and new businesses. BT also launched the world's first mobile telephone trial with the iPhone at John Lewis's Chorley shop. The BBC revealed the first test customers won't pay for data and will pay for the call only when they next make a call.
