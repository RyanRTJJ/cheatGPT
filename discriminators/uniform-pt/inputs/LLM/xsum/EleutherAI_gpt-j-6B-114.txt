, open style of rugby but they have got some physical power in the pack.

"They have great speed and their set-piece game is very good, which is why Scotland lost against them last year.

"We are looking forward to the game but it is going to be a very tough, physical challenge.

"Ireland have got a tough game coming up against Italy on Friday but we can't turn our backs on these two games.

"If we don't get over the two games, it would be a shock to get over and, at this stage, we must keep the focus firmly set on one game at a time.

"We are playing to win, but it is a must start and get through the games against Italy and Ireland.

"The pressure does not stop now, with the visit of England to Murrayfield the next Saturday.

"To win that game and get into the top eight is an important target.

"Our focus is on that but we can't rest on our laurels and are expecting a tough game with Ireland. It is a must-win."

And Murray's side are certainly looking for a win after their World Cup experience.

"We have a lot to learn that in the event," Murray said. "We made an awful lot of mistakes that we should not have done.

"It was a hard season but we can still learn.

"I said to them after the final as a group that if we can have a go and compete for a top finish then we were going to do it.

"That is the goal and we are now at Edinburgh trying to do that."

Meanwhile, Edinburgh coach Scott Hastings is expecting to be without two key players, the second-rowers Grant Gilchrist and Blair Irwin and fly-half Michael Tindell is not involved in the first two games.
