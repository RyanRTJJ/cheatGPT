 first micro-lending project to serve an English-speaking minority. The number of loans so far surpasses the total number of loans that have been issued in the UK in the last 10 years.

The Scottish organisation is a member of Grameen Africa, part of the non-profit Grameen International, which has been operating in developing countries since 1977. It started in Scotland in 2010, and has grown from strength to strength to now be run from an office in Glasgow as well as offices in Kenya, Tanzania and other African countries. It recently increased its team to more than 25 employees.

Grameen in the UK and Ireland has created five loan products to cater for the UK’s English-speaking minority (or minority group or ethnicity). Its loans focus on three loan products: small loans for individuals for emergencies, small loans for businesses for cashflow problems and small loans for NGOs to help the environment. The loans are also designed to be flexible and easy-to-access. The aim is to address issues like early pregnancy and teenage pregnancy, HIV and malaria, among a wide range of social problems. In addition, it has set up a Grameen Youth Network (GYN) to encourage participation in the loan process. By providing a network of young people as borrowers and volunteers, GYNs engage more people in the loan process and make it more accessible and interesting to more people.

The Scottish operation is part of a nationwide Grameen UK network that was set up in 2009 to take advantage of the UK’s high business and investment climate and high demand for cheap finance. It is a model that continues to develop in the UK. In fact, according to a recent report, the number of individuals who had access to microfinance loans in Scotland last year was more than double that in 2009, totalling 13,859, up from 6,947 five years ago. In the last financial year, Scottish microfinance banks helped more than 27,000 people.
