he House of Lords Constitution Committee in October 2011:

"A Written Constitution could set out rights and responsibilities, reflecting our changing society and protect those less able to defend themselves. It could make explicit our shared values and rights and help us to define what it is to be British. However, I believe such a document must be drafted with great care, in line with our culture and traditions, and should remain consistent with the essential values and principles of our unwritten constitution. It should be approved by Parliament, as the voice of the people."
