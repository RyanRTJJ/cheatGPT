Hong Kong health officials said more than 2,000 samples from public places had been tested since the outbreak in the capital.

Local media reports have said that samples of seafood from five waters in central and southern China - including two areas in Guangdong province, one in Guangxi region and one in Sichuan province - were found to be contaminated.

The city's official Xinhua news agency said on Wednesday that some local pharmacies had begun selling "poison dosing" packs that could be used to help suppress the pain caused by food poisoning or other illnesses.

The National Environment Agency said a sample of the sea creatures was taken from a bowl of seaweed soup in a store in Wong Wai district as part of its investigation.

CFS said in a statement: "A sample of the fish was sent for analysis to the Hong Kong Institute of Biotechnology and Environmental Sciences laboratory, which
