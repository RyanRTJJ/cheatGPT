 7 per cent this year. This is in a bid to compensate the cost of nuclear plants which are struggling to service a massive bill.

Scottish Power is also in danger of becoming the first Scottish company to post a loss in a decade.

A profit for last year of £10.7m was cut to £6.1m as costs rose.

But Scottish power company shares fell, ending the day just below the 100-day moving average. They were down 2.5 per cent at 202.5p.

Investors are worried that if the nuclear and power crisis continues in the next few months, the value of shares including Scottish Power could drop to 200p when the stock is delisted in 2016.

This week the company announced another round of pay cuts affecting 400 employees. The aim of this was to help ease the impact of falling wholesale prices on its balance sheets, which means the group will have to continue borrowing on its UK borrowing facilities at a higher interest rate to remain solvent.

The company said it was "well placed" with a range of options in the event of a prolonged economic downturn.

However, Scottish Power's chief executive Paul Wheelhouse said in June that the company had to accept that the current business model could not work in a world where more energy is used in transport.

Mr Wheelhouse said at the time: "We've taken all the measures possible. One of the measures has been to pay some of our lowest-paid team, the ones that have been supporting the nuclear energy programmes.

"We've all done it, so I'm not going to be in a position to stand in the way of people if they want to do something different."

But this week Scottish Energy chief executive Tom Pickering conceded that "the game is up" without a breakthrough.

"There is still plenty of opportunity to change the energy model," he said.
