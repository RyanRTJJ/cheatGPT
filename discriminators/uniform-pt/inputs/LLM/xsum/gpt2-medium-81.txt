"If anything I'm disappointed that there hasn't been a national reaction. But the Government said in 2015 that Oxford would become the first local authority to introduce a national education service."

Ms Cameron has previously backed proposals by Labour to use academies to take children from primary school through into higher learning. A petition to set up a national high-achievement school for young people has already gathered over 500 signatures.

The decision followed a Guardian investigation, led by former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, into the extent of Government cuts at Oxford.

On Tuesday, it emerged that more than a third of the council's £28 million budget allocation is now set to go to private companies to train and staff schools rather than traditional government-run schools.

The Daily Mail reported last month that the council was facing an £85m budget cut as many services and staff were eliminated to meet the target, while the council's parent authority, Essex County Council, revealed schools would no longer be run by state funding.

The mayor-elect has said she is committed to returning schools to local control but has also said she wants to ensure "the services that they offer and the skills on offer are not going to decline as a result".

Earlier this year, the city's local authority, Greater London Authority (GLU), pledged that its support for academies would be extended, and that "it will not only invest in schools, but also encourage local authorities to create higher-quality teachers and learning and support for students through independent academies".

As well as Mr Cameron, Mr McDonnell has also pledged to provide a national policy framework for the introduction of the model of academies.
