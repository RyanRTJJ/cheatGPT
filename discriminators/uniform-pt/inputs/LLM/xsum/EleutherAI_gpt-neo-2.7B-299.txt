 that the information about individual nuclear power plants was unclassified.

The government has been criticized for keeping the details of nuclear plant projects so secret for so long. Under the nuclear deal with North Korea, all information on the construction programs for a small number of sites were supposed to have been made public by the end of 2012 in a bid to facilitate international scrutiny.

But after South Korean investigators said that construction projects on 10 North Korean sites were not fully completed, a number of media outlets – including CNN, Newsweek, the Korea Herald, the Washington Post and the New York Times – reported earlier this month that the North and South Korean governments did not disclose the progress of their construction projects.

Yahoo News reported Thursday that one of the leaked documents said a nuclear power program in North Korea’s Yongbyon complex was being delayed for “a period of one to two years.”

Yonhap cited the documents as saying that the plant program at Yongbyon complex had been repeatedly delayed, but a spokesman for the North’s Ministry of Unification said Thursday the report was “completely baseless.”

The Yonhap report said the delay in the nuclear program in Yongbyon was caused by problems in the design stage and other technical problems.

In the documents, the construction on the Yongbyon nuclear power plant was described as a “relatively low priority” but was said to be “necessary for the economic development of the country and in order to strengthen its national defense capability.”

The report said the nuclear plan included four reactors in Yongbyon and construction of an additional four reactors.

North Korea’s nuclear plan for Yongbyon was reported at the same time as North Korea’s decision to abandon a long-term nuclear agreement with the United States, a move followed by Pyongyang’s rejection of the IAEA safeguards regime.
