, who said he has never seen his performance level since retiring in 2010, is confident he can win again.

"I think so. I can't be different," he told Reuters. "I've never seen other times in my career. When you're at a higher level, you try to do everything better. It's not about one day, it's all the races in between."

Red Bull, the most popular and highest-profile racing team in Brazil, believes he can become the sport's current version of Juan Manuel Fangio by finishing ahead of team-mate Daniel Ricciardo who is eight points ahead.

"I think the team believes that he is the new leader of the team," Red Bull said in its statement.

Massa's last win came in 2006 at Monaco, where he came from 10th on the grid to beat team-mate Rubens Barrichello. He was denied the last six F1 title by Ferrari in the 2008 and '09 seasons, the most recent for which he will be eligible to compete.

"I'm very happy now," he added. "I never saw a better time of my career. I think I was not the same driver until this time and now there is still something more to come after this performance.

"After what I had in Formula 1, I still have the same feeling I had before with the fans. I want them to enjoy the race with me and to have something more to see."

Massa said he would retire without being the last of the champions, but added: "I'm happy that I can say I fought without being the last. That's the way it is, and now it's my turn to fight."

Barrichello is the only driver to win on the two-leg Canadian double-header in Montreal. Barrichello is 0.8 points clear of Lewis Hamilton who led by 0.7. Ricciardo is now 0.4 points clear, with Hamilton and Massa tied on the podium.

"This season I made my best team, and I have always said you need to win in a Grand Prix to keep your place in Formula 1," Massa said.
