 let a shopper opt out of the "super saver option", nor will it provide the customer with any more extra delivery time than the first 15% discount.

On the other hand, a shopper who opts to use the super saver delivery is effectively told they are not getting any extra service and are expected to leave the site entirely after 15 minutes.

Online retailer UK will now be able to impose additional charges for orders on its website to make them more attractive for consumers, particularly those with relatively low incomes. The move has been in response to suggestions that many businesses in Britain rely on the super saver to deliver service before they can get a cut of their costs.

However, it will mean an average shopper with a £5.47 savings account will pay £35 to cover the $80 extra service charge. Although the average customer is entitled to the extra service, many online retailers and retailers have no idea who to contact if they experience this.

"This is completely ridiculous and simply shows how desperate many people in Britain are to get away with it. The big players like Amazon, Apple and eBay could use something like this," said Mark Farr, founder of Farrance.

But others pointed out that the move might be unpopular in Britain for any other way than to provide free online shopping for all.

Chris Smith, of the consumer watchdog Fair Trading, said: "This must be a really bad move not only for consumers but also for UK retailers and supermarkets. We need an end to it and ensure every retailer and company pays fair and accurate customer care as they invest in consumer service."

However, she added: "This is a big deal and it will be hugely unpopular across the UK, particularly in England, especially if this move is enacted.

"However, the cost of doing business in this market is extremely low as many small businesses are simply not doing what they should be doing."
