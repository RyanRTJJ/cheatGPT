They watched in horror as white cabdriver Wilson drove his lorry straight through them, killing two and injuring 19.

One of the victims - Oleg Mironov, an 18-year-old trainee accountant, was on his bike along with school friends Andrey Kochetkov, 19, and Anton Dementyev, 19.

Andrey said that he never dreamed the lorry would hit them the way it did:

“We are all very shocked. It was so terrible that we just do not know what to think.

"I would never in a million years have expected to be killed on the street of my hometown."

Andrew Wilson, 55, was convicted of causing death by careless driving in a court last year and given a 12-month community order.

He was sentenced at Winchester Crown Court on Friday.

Wilson did not turn up to the hearing in his crown court robes, but was later captured by police at his home in South Norwood, south London.

He had been given permission by the court's judge to wear his business casual clothes rather than a suit.

However, he was pictured wearing a navy suit, white shirt and jumper by SWNS, standing outside his home.

Judge David Pugh, who presided over the hearing, told him:

"You were found not guilty of causing death by carelessness and I can understand your disappointment and the fact that you are at a loss as to what to think but that did not happen.

"However, one cannot be a party to this situation and not be culpable."

Mr Wilson's lawyer, Neil Sheehan, said: “He is very deeply sorry for everything that has happened.”

Following the conclusion of the hearing, Police said they would consider withdrawing the case, but said Mr Nesbitt was still unhappy with the sentence given.

Detective Inspector Gareth Jones of the Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: ‘Mr Wilson has been convicted of causing Mr Mironov and Mr Kochetkov serious injuries which have had a significant impact on their lives
