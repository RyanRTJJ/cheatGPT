The decision followed a meeting on Saturday.

Councillors want the council more involved in the support they are given by charities such as Citizens UK (now The British Heart Foundation), which has trained the two support workers through the national Citizens service.

The council has run some of its own surveys of parents in the community on why they keep the children. These have identified the issues of lack of money, housing issues and stigma. They are now being fed into a programme on the council website, in partnership with the NHS Choices programme.

Some of the parents have moved into work. Others are struggling to find secure housing and are facing financial insecurity.

Although these are not the solutions at first glance, the council has identified the benefits to wider society of supporting people living with serious mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression so they don’t have to go down the same road.

Other parents cannot get work. Others have to travel further and are denied health and social care support. These families need the extra help and support from the local authority, the Citizens service, and the NHS Choices programme.

Councillor Tim Lyle, who represents Brantcliffe ward which includes the area, said: “We need to provide support so that families do not have to go through the same problems, but it’s all about understanding why people get the support and what can be done to make sure people get the support they need.

“The Citizens UK programme has been very successful in recruiting and training support workers.

“This type of support is vital to people and we have not seen any issues with people getting support outside of the Citizens service and their local area.”

The community group that provides a forum for parents and support services to meet regularly is now looking at building on it with an idea for a wider network of local communities. They could be asked to support a Citizens programme of this kind.

We will continue to have discussions about this with the residents, the council, and Citizens UK, who have trained the volunteers. We hope to have a response
