ness forward by adopting the anthem as the national anthem when the country hosts the soccer World Cup in 2018.

In a statement on Tuesday, he said: "English is not a language. And it should probably not have been used as a symbol of allegiance at Wembley Stadium before the England-Sweden match last June. It's about time we stopped taking the 'English way' for granted."

A member of the parliamentary culture, media, and sport select committee, which is debating a bill proposing England adopt the national anthem as its official anthem, Perkins said the introduction of a national anthem and anthem rules is "unnecessary."

"In an official report to parliament last month, we said that while our own song seems to have been chosen by accident, we do not want to use the anthem as our national anthem," he added.

Perkins stressed that the rules should only apply to England, adding that if the idea is adopted elsewhere it could be a "terrible mistake."

"Why do we have rules and regulations regarding the national anthem in other nations, but not of England?" he said. "There is an unwritten law that we may have to abide by in England, as we are not a nation of laws. I am only a Member of Parliament."
