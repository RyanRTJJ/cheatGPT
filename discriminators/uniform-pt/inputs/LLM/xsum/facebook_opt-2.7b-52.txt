"Following three consecutive monthly declines in like-for-like sales, the British high street continued to recover in March, driven by improved consumer confidence following the recent Brexit vote, alongside increasing consumer spending and greater job security," said Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive.

This month's sales were buoyed by the Easter holidays, which extended till March 27, whereas Easter usually takes place in April.

However, these sales were in line with sales levels the same month a year earlier, and the BRC expects total retail sales to fall by between 1.3% and 1.5% in 2014 as a whole.

"Retailers' first quarter has been disappointing, and we don't expect it to pick up significantly until the third quarter," said Howard Archer, UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight.

The survey showed that shoppers spent "broadly in line" with inflation, while there was stronger price growth on food than in clothing and footwear.

In contrast, clothing and footwear sales dipped 0.5% against year ago levels, on top of a sharp drop of 13.2% in February.

"As was the case in February, the weakness of clothing and footwear in March reflects the impact of last year's Easter," said KPMG UK retail, consumer and retail partner Michael Hewson.

He said that in both March and February the proportion of sales going to "less expensive" value offers such as discounted bargains and reductions on the higher-end was particularly strong.

Helen Dickinson from the BRC said that clothing prices on average are 3% lower than last year in value terms and the sector was already seeing increased discounts as a result of the weak pound and inflation.

However, she said some retailers were pushing the prices to higher margins.

The BRC and KPMG survey of 27,000 retail locations showed that spending rose by more in bigger stores than at small ones, although it was "not enough to make up for the weak level of consumer confidence".

It also showed that the number of new customers to UK high streets fell in March for the 20th consecutive month, with small stores suffering the sharpest decline in the number of shoppers, by 1,100
