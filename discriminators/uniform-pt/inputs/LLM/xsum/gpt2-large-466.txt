, 25km, 11-lane north-south motorway, to be used at peak and off-peak times by the country's biggest cities.

O'Dowd has warned there will be a "chilly mix" of motorway-based and rail-based traffic on the new road with an average speed limit of 60km/h.

"We will add another 70, and a further 40, to the existing motorway system - and our new Northern Ireland roads will soon make Belfast traffic feel more direct, safer and more attractive," O'Dowd said in an op-ed in the Belfast Telegraph.

But many of the projects planned at the newly built area are estimated to cost an estimated â‚¬2bn and will take several years to complete.

It is understood that the new road in question is being built as part of a deal to reduce delays for construction of the Belfast-Boxton Road Link and the new Belfast Motorway. And that costings are being worked out by a Dublin agency in order to calculate potential profits in construction contracts for those lines.

It is believed that the Northern Ireland infrastructure agency, Irish Network Rail (INR), made an announcement of this kind before the public inquiry on the work started at the site early on Wednesday morning.

That announcement set the scene for many protests in the city ahead of the site's announcement. One protest planned at the site, organised by SDLP councillor Noel Sharkey, was due to come to a close before the day's work began, but this is understood to have been adjourned at around 11am.

The event was to get under way at 2pm, but some of the thousands of SDLP demonstrators outside the site began marching around 2pm.

The protesters' action ended around 3pm and those who remained at the site were advised by police that they would have to stay away from the area until 9am. Police advised them they could use the M6 motorway to get around, with bus routes and car-sharing routes being employed to allow people to get through.

The protest, which started at the traffic lights in front of the site, included SDLP MP Sammy Wilson and SDLP Councillors Jim McKellar and Peadar Tully
