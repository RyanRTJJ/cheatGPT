 the Frenchman two weeks ago, started at left winger, and will fill their role, which saw Gerard Pique and Marco Verratti replaced in last weekend's 2-1 defeat at Sporting Leipzig.

Pique and Verratti both remain available in the transfer market, but Pique is not yet convinced he will take over at Barcelona, with Piqué reportedly a desire to stay in Spain.

Piqué did not sign a new contract last month, and at the end of the day a club such as Real Sociedad will have to wait until the end of the season to join Inter Milan in the January transfer window.

But Iker Casillas, the main candidate who is thought to have left this summer, could also be considered. The Argentina international's former Arsenal and Barcelona teams boss has a record of 6-6-0 and a 1-4-3 record at Barcelona, having missed two games this season due to a thigh problem caused by an operation in October.

Real Sociedad have just 11 men on the pitch this season with only seven forwards in midfield. However, the club have been in the news since Fernando Torres left for Liverpool three months ago, having also lost a number of key players such as Lloris and Pepe after the striker was sent off.

And that situation is likely to continue even when the main choice is Real Madrid's Alvaro Morata for the transfer window. It would still be a big step up for the club to be a serious contender in the Champions League, but Real will do everything possible to stay in the competition for a place in the top 5 on one of the worst sides in Europe.
