 said the road was not a priority for funding and that the road would likely have to be closed even after the bridge had been built.

But he said a temporary bridge while the main structure was being built would provide a temporary solution for people on the island, and that he believed it would take less than three years in total.

"This is why we set up the campsite," said Mr Workman. "We know about the problems the island has. The first thing we need from an emergency service is our road. Without access the island community has to rely on road transport and this creates a safety problem for us, especially at night, which is when we get our highest tide.

"But we are really lucky this year with the tide, luckily it has been less than usual."

Mr Workman said the island had been completely cut off during storms like those that hit Britain in January and in February this year.

"This time we had three boats arriving during one of the worst storms we have ever seen. Fortunately, we had the capacity but the lorries and buses had to wait while the police and the fire brigade were able to pass," he said.

"We really don't know what will happen because the last time we had problems with flooding they came to us in the middle of the night."

South Wales Police was contacted by the Guardian for comment after reports on its website that the road had been closed to the public as a temporary bridge is built.

The website added the bridge should be a "game-changer" for emergency services accessing the island.

It said: "It is now estimated that up to 1,500 vehicles will have to be diverted due to the bridge in one week.

"Despite the fact that there have been problems in the past with access, the majority of access is still via the A483, albeit at an average speed of 30mph, rather at speed."
