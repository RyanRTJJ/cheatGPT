 McGuinness as to his possible involvement in paramilitary groups. The Sinn Féin leader was recently arrested by the PSNI as part of an inquiry into the illegal sale of guns.

Donaldson was in Washington as part of a delegation to the American Jewish Committee (AJC), lobbying Congress on the Middle East. He met with Republican Congressman Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas.

Donaldson said that McGuinness had “disciplined himself” with regard to the questioning. But he said that his “recollection was that Martin McGuinness himself advised against it”.

He told Sinn Fein’s MPs that McGuinness was a “model citizen” and had “disciplined himself”. “He is not a member of any paramilitary, he has said as much”, he said.

Asked by Sinn Fein’s Westminster leader Niall O’Donovan whether the security services were still carrying out the practices that led to the death of Bobby Sands, Donaldson said, “I’m not going to get into specific intelligence-gathering in this case”.

The question of a security services inquiry into the events at Derry during the IRA’s ‘Loyalist Road Peace’ ceasefire between 1977 and 1981 was raised during an investigation into the hunger strike, chaired by retired justice Sir Brian Leveson, in 2013.

That study, Operation Parachute, concluded that members of the security services knew about what was going on, and that they did nothing to stop it.

Donaldson said that Sinn Féin believed the Leveson report was the most thorough report to date into the IRA’s activities at the time. “Sinn Fein has campaigned on this for about five years, Sinn Fein stood on it at that time and has maintained that position,” he said.

Sinn Fein politicians also briefed the Commons committee on Friday about the ‘Loyalist Road Peace’ ceasefire.

Donaldson said an inquiry into the truce’s events was “one of the cornerstones of the peace process and a cornerstone of the Good Friday Agreement”.
