 to its lowest level since 2016.

The figures show that in June 2019 A&E 4-hour performance at QEUH was only 65.1%.

The hospital said this was due to exceptional circumstances such as the admission of children for the first time in eight years.

The party said these figures were evidence of the Scottish Government's "failure to ensure medical care is provided quickly and efficiently at the hospital".

It said it was "simply unacceptable that over a quarter of patients who arrive in A&E at the QEUH are waiting over four hours to be seen".

It called on the Scottish Government to address the issue "urgently", saying the hospital needed "more staff and more resources to meet the needs of the people of Glasgow".
