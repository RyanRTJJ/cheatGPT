146.50 per household would remain unchanged but the parties in UK politics, who already provide the bulk of the funding for the corporation could further reduce their contribution.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage argued that the BBC should remain a public service broadcaster and that its current fee should stay and that parties in UK politics could reduce their contribution to the BBC. He suggested that the governmental funding that currently funds the BBC should be used for more specific programming, such as children's content, news and current affairs. Farage also argued that commercialising existing BBC output would be detrimental to the corporation's public service format. 

Farage's proposal is an attempt to limit the BBC's dependence on government funding while preserving its public service broadcasting requirements. This move could have several positive effects. Firstly, it would preserve the quality of BBC programming and increase the ability of the BBC to focus on producing the type of content requested by viewers. Secondly, the reduction in Government funding would reduce the BBC's political influence and increase transparency in the BBC's decision-making process. It would also result in an increase in BBC efficiency, as it can focus more on producing content that its viewers actually want to watch. 

Finally, it would benefit the BBC as an independent body and allow it to continue its mission to produce impartial and balanced programmes. It would also give the BBC greater autonomy from the government and be able to act as a more varied public broadcaster, more closely tuned to the public's interests.
