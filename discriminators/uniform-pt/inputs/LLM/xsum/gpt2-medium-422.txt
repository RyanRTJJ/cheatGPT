 cannot eradicate them.

"This is an example where we found out that we can help insecticides do damage to other species with our research," said lead author Jia Zhou, an assistant professor of entomology at the University of Maryland. "It means we can do it by treating insects rather than controlling pests."

Since 2008, Zhou, colleagues Yujiang Li and Wei Wei, and their postdoctoral researcher Li Wang created a method for capturing these insects and using it to study the harmful effects of a particular pesticide in water, as well as in soil and at indoor pools.

Bacteria in soil act as the pests' "antifungals," collecting or destroying the microscopic pieces of insect larva and moths and their droppings from contaminated sites. Because bugs carry these toxins from one area to another, they carry them all across the country and around the world. This creates a significant environmental burden, making many countries, including China, unable to effectively control them.

When Zhou and other researchers infected plants and animals with pesticide residues through bacteria they produced in vitro, their control of their bugs' destructive effect was greatly enhanced. The resulting data were published online this month in the journal Ecology.

"These animals come down to our water supply, their water source comes down to their soil surface — it will be just like a lawn or garden if a pesticide is present," Zhou explained.

"If I have an insecticide planted at my place, it's going to cause my lawn to die — if the farmers come there and use a pesticide, they're going to use up all that pesticide."

"My field of expertise is that I can identify this and take steps to control this problem," Zhou said.

It is a challenge at a time when China has been trying to boost sustainable farming that grows far more organic matter in its fields and is carbon-neutral.

In fact, this year China is on track to grow nearly 40
