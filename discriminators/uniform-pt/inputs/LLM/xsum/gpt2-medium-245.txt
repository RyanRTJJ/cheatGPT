An opposition leader, Renan Mottel, claimed the gunman killed the politician "to gain power for the people. This is a bloodier and more tragic violence than anything that I have ever heard".

Mottel said a Venezuelan judge would rule whether the killing of the opposition lawyer and former presidential candidate was justified and said that the security situation may be worse now after Thursday's shooting and Friday's protests.
