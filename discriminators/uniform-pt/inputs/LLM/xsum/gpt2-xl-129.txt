 teleportation - a phenomenon in which the particle is "teleported" from one place to another - within a microsecond.

It could signal the arrival of a new planet in our Solar System with an uncertainty of a mere three parts in 10 million.

Such small errors are impossible with a signal transmitted by radio to Earth. The microsecond it took the messages to reach the two stations is a crucial test for the achievement. It implies that the satellites could stay in orbit until 2024.

Micius' twin - and perhaps its main successor - is named TESS, short for Threshold Of Technologies Experiment. TESS is designed to see if the theory that our Sun will ultimately collapse as a black hole will be borne out.

To this end the mission carries six instruments. One of them measures radioactive elements by counting the number of "daughter" particles produced as they decay from their parent. Another detects gamma rays and other particles in space.

The fourth measures the charged particles produced by charged particles in Earth's atmosphere. The final three, each measuring a specific particle as a function of time, provide a record of our solar system during different time intervals.

It also carries a nuclear instrument dubbed the Super-Kamiokande. The two-tonne instrument will be operated through 2030.
