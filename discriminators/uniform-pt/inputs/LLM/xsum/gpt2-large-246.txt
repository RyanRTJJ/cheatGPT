 however, saying that Huawei had no connection with Beijing.

"It is the opinion of Huawei's management team that the allegations have no merit and will not impact Huawei's development," he said.

"We believe the US needs to continue to ensure that the global industry understands our brand and that no one person has any influence over the Huawei brand."

Huawei has previously defended its business relationships overseas, claiming it supports more than 600 companies, from Google to BMW, and more than 2,500 local suppliers.

However, the company has been under attack for alleged ties with its Chinese suppliers - an accusation Huawei says it rejects. The US has also slapped Huawei with a counter-proposal, accusing it of breaching US trade laws by selling Chinese-made systems to US firms.

The company declined to elaborate on its operations in the US or its recent dealings with the FBI, as did its lawyers in China. It has reportedly received several government investigations into the issue.

One of the countries targeted by recent investigations has been North Korea, where Huawei has a big market share. Huawei has also come under scrutiny in Brazil after the company joined the state-run telecommunications giant Telcel in establishing a business connection with the country's telco Telcel SA.

In the latest probe into Huawei, a Senate subcommittee investigating US relations with China on Wednesday questioned Chinese ambassador Cui Tiankai about Huawei's role in helping Chinese telecoms giant ZTE set up a joint venture in the United States and India.

The US government is investigating the Chinese government, the Chinese-American Chamber of Commerce and ZTE on suspicion of ties to North Korea in what could be a wider effort to root out Huawei's ties to Chinese military and intelligence agencies.
