 Ireland parish but the Church of Ireland voted to make it a parish of other denomination.

Knocknagin's proposal says there should be no religious affiliation or religious affiliation requirements as part of the merger.

The Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic Church each have their own diocese and its own diocesan clergy, parishes, schools, cemeteries, colleges and other services.

No reason for rejection of merger by any parishioners

"The proposed diocese will be operated by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin and Diocesan Bishop of Dublin, Dr John Charles McQuaid, and by the Anglican Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Tomás Ó Fiaich, who together with the Diocesan Bishop of Cork - Dr Philip Murphy - will both work together very closely and closely consult to ensure that the merger is carried out in a peaceful and dignified way," a statement read.

"No reason whatsoever exists for rejection of the merger by any parishioners. Both dioceses have made it clear in a meeting held on June 8th that in the spirit of Christian unity they will work together and consult closely around the proposal.

"We are confident that the spirit of these proposals will bring the best benefits for the people of Dublin and for the archdiocese of Dublin and the diocese of Dublin. They will be implemented in a respectful, respectful manner and in a manner that can be easily understood and accepted by the people and their parishioners."
