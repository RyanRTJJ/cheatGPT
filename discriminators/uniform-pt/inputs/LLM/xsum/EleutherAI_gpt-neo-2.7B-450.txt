 leader, Mr Abbott said the cuts made to higher education were in the “trenches of the fight for the future of our great nation” and the government must not “repeat the mistakes of the past or the Coalition's predecessor”. He rejected “outlandish claims” that universities are “the engine room of nation growth”.

Shadow education minister Kate Ellis said the Coalition’s latest cuts would amount to $1.6 billion in student fees in 2014-15. “This is unacceptable: $1.6 billion in student fees to be slashed by the Abbott attack on higher education,” Ms Ellis said. “It is the students who are being punished.” Shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Robb, said Mr Abbott had announced cuts that would do “very, very little” to help Australia’s universities, and claimed Australia ranks 24th in world rankings of higher education. While the Federal government’s planned $1.1 billion funding increase, which Mr Abbott announced on Thursday, was welcomed, Mr Abbott’s cuts would harm Australia's universities.

“Today's attack on higher education makes a long list of cuts that the government is attempting to force through parliament - all of which will be a cost to our universities,” he said. The attack will inevitably reduce the amount of public investment in higher education, Mr Abbott said. “This Government is determined to attack the sector rather than build on the strength it shows,” he said. In an effort to make them even more attractive to students, the Abbott government has also pledged to force a review of university fees by 2015. University of NSW and Queensland’s Griffith University will be among those forced to make concessions to the Abbott government as it tries to protect higher education.

The government will force universities to introduce an Australian Student Fee Levy in 2014 that will increase university fees while also funding student services. The proposed levy increases to $7000 from $5000 at the beginning of next year, but then falls to $5000 in 2015. It will apply to Queensland and NSW students only. A
