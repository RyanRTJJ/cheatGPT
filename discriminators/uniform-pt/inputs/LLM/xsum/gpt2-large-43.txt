 said the death toll was expected to rise "even further" and warned of "horrific destruction" in the capital.

In other violence, several shells hit a camp housing Palestinians from the besieged Gaza Strip who were escaping the fighting, according to Amr al-Ahmed, a paramedic for the Palestinian Red Crescent.

Another airstrike targeted a medical facility in Gaza City that has treated scores of those injured from Israel during the current conflict.

Mr Al-Ahmed said about 90 Palestinians in al-Hajja camp have been treated so far. "We need to use this new space to provide medical services," he said.

In the east of Gaza, an Israeli Defence Forces missile killed a woman with four children in a house that militants shelled overnight, in what the military has described as an attack that killed her and her children "while working toward a military objective".

The Gaza health ministry said 25 people were killed on Monday, 20 in a missile strike, which hit a school on a busy road in Jabalia refugee camp. The ministry said 10 schools were hit in the past 24 hours and another 25 were damaged.

A statement from the Health Ministry said 30 people were killed and about 40 wounded in the past 24 hours.

Israel said its air force had hit several targets in Gaza City today, but was unable to say whether it targeted any terror targets. The Israeli military said it launched three strikes near the central Gaza town of Rafah early today that caused no casualties or damage, but warned that "a large number of rockets" remained unsecured.

Rockets fired into Israel have struck Israeli cities before, but none of the blasts has caused such widespread damage as those over Gaza on Sunday.

A spokesman for Israel's military said that rockets were fired by militants across the border from Egypt since the beginning of the war. Two rockets were intercepted at Tel Aviv airport last Friday and another landed near the southern city of Ashdod on Sunday, military spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner
