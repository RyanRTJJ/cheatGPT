 injured and at least 25 migrants sent back on to an island in the English Channel before the situation was contained.

Folkestone immigration centre chief Paul Gerrard confirmed one of the migrant groups had deliberately scaled the fencing and said that some 200 people had breached the barriers in the hours following the breach.

He told The Telegraph: “We can confirm that 200 migrants are believed to have escaped from the camp after breaking the fence, which has been re-secured just after 1pm.

“Our staff were unable to manage the crowd and they managed with the assistance of Kent Police and British Army. As a result some of the migrants fell into the sea.”

“We are investigating the incident.“

British troops at Folkestone’s terminal building have been on standby to help. Footage from the French port of Calais showed scores of migrants scaling the fence into a port area. Footage also showed migrants on boats moored near the port.

A spokesman for Eurotunnel, which operates the Chunnel, said "The incident on the beach in Calais occurred this morning shortly after 06:30 UTC.

“Four Eurotunnel employees were present, supervising and assisting with the control of access into the site. A French police officer, part of the Eurotunnel team, was also injured. The event resulted in a partial evacuation of the Eurotunnel terminal and the temporary suspension as part of normal operational procedures of Calais-bound trains."

He added: “The situation has now been brought under control. All train traffic has since resumed and one Eurostar train was evacuated to the terminal building.

"Four of the Eurotunnel workers were slightly injured but have now been taken to hospital as a precaution. An enquiry is being made to identify the other two who were supervising the event and also to determine who is responsible and if charges will be brought."

Eurotunnel had earlier said: "At about 06:30 UTC, four Eurotunnel employees on site were supervising and assisting with the control of access into the site. A French police officer, part of the Eurotunnel team, was also injured. The
