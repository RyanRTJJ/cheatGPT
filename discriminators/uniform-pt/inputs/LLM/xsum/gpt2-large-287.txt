seekers as the cheese was paraded around at a two-mile race.

But now the official event has officially collapsed following an agreement with organisers not to put the cheese on display in their markets unless they have made a profit, or until at least the end of July, depending on the cheese.

Toby Young, head of the FSA National Cheese Association, described the move as "absolutely ridiculous.

"There are tens of millions of pounds of cheese in the UK that has to be sold. We're already seeing a huge loss in sales due to the government's policy that makes it impossible for us to properly market the cheese."

The FSA said that it had made its decision after talks with the Cheese Rollers Association.

The former chief executive of the FSA says the decision is "un-categorical".

Michael Saunders, who took over in June 2007, said the FSA has "always upheld our mission in keeping our markets open".

He added: "It was our view that the cheese manufacturers are now selling very little and that they'll be making less money than they would have made before the FSA came into the picture."

Culture Secretary John Whittingdale announced the decision in March.

He said the new policy is aimed at preventing local traders from selling their own products and stopping them being undercut by bigger chains.

He said: "We will be applying a three-tiered scheme of restrictions to this market.

"The first tier will apply to most cheese producers, although it is possible this ban will apply to some cheese producers in Northern Ireland as well as cheese producers in Northern Ireland where the cheese is sold in the Northern Ireland market.

"In addition, the second tier will apply to smaller companies which are selling fewer than 10,000 tonnes of cheese per year and have yet to secure an agreement with the FSA to open up their market to sale.

"The third phase will apply to larger and more successful companies which have successfully received FSA approval to sell in the Northern Ireland market,
