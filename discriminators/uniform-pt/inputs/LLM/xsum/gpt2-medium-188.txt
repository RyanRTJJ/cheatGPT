 said: 'One thing to be cautious about is saying the UK is going to survive without oil and gas, which is a bit like saying in some parts of Asia that the country will survive without fishing.

'We are in such a difficult place right now. The Scottish economy is in tatters and the population hasn't recovered and we see jobs in every industry in decline - the oil and gas sector in particular.'

A spokesman for the Scotland Office said: 'The government is committed to the production of shale gas and other gas-rich resources in the UK and the Scottish government is now reviewing our plans.

It adds that the industry believes that Scotland has a proven technology that provides the technology that will enable this to happen within the next few years.

Mr Neil asked: 'In light of a possible UK recession, what is your concern over potential job losses and the potential for the Scottish economy to suffer with the prospect remaining on and on?'

In July, after months of warnings over future oil jobs, BP revealed that about 30,000 jobs will be at risk in the oil and gas industry in Scotland when the oil price returns to its 2013 levels.

At the time Scottish Secretary Stephen Gethins warned the industry that 'all options are available to avoid or reduce Scotland's oil-related employment costs.'

He added: 'While it is too early to speak in any detail about the implications of a further downturn in the UK domestic and global economies, we are absolutely in control of today's market conditions.

The UK's biggest oil and gas companies, including BP, Royal Dutch Shell and ENI, have said they have enough reserves to support the peak production of 8million barrels a day, the equivalent of 1.6 million cars. A spokeswoman for BP said: 'We are not talking about an oil spill at all. All of our oil projects in Scotland will be in line for significant increases in production over the next few years.'
