 an indoor hard court at the National Tennis Centre.

It was Swan's elite-level debut for Britain and she produced a composed performance, showing few signs of nerves against one of world tennis' foremost players.

‘It felt amazing,’ she said.

‘It was a dream come true. Being able to represent my country was so great and I still can’t believe it.

‘I had a tactic going in and I think I managed to stick to it quite well. It was about patience, staying focussed and believing in myself.

‘I shed a few tears after the match. It was really emotional and I was really happy with what I did today. I can’t wait to see what the weekend brings.’

The victory set the tone for Britain's victory against the United States, who have won the Fed Cup in the last 18 years.

They went on to win the tie 3-2 when Heather Watson defeated Coco Vandeweghe in the deciding rubber, giving Britain their first title in over 30 years.

Swan, who is currently studying for her A-levels at the prestigious Wellsbourne Tennis Academy, hopes that her victory can be an inspiration for other aspiring junior players.

‘I’d love for it to be a turning point for British Fed Cup,’ she said.

‘Hopefully it encourages more young players to come through and it can be a great stepping stone to push British tennis forward.’
