 fine £2,500 for taking his daughter off her father's care because Mrs Platt was worried about her safety.

However Isle of Wight Court heard that while his daughter was away, his husband was also home because he could not work, so they were left financially vulnerable. Both Mr and Mrs Platt paid back the £2,500 fine and had appealed but lost their appeal in 2014, when the Isle of Wight Council agreed she should have received a full £1,500 fine because she had been a flight risk.
