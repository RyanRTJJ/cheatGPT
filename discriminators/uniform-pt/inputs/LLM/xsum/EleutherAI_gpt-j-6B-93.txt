Rail campaigners say there has been a dramatic drop in passenger journeys between the Midland cities since the franchising round in 2004, when new companies were given control. In some of the worst affected areas people are likely to face delays of up to six hours. The journey time between the capital and the Nottingham station last used as a stop for British Rail was 6 hours 50 minutes. It is now likely to take at least 9 hours. If the time between Birmingham and Nottingham runs 12 minutes faster the average journey time between the cities is now more than double what it was 100 years ago. Rail fair's research has been based on government figures which show that the average passenger journey between the two cities - where British Rail was not based in the 1990s - is now 8 hours and 7 minutes. In the decade ending 1999 passenger journeys between the two cities rose by 10%, largely because of people travelling in the summer. Between 2000 and 2009, the overall rise was only 5%. However, for the past 10 years passenger journeys have remained more or less flat, before climbing up by 7.6% last year. It was the first ever increase in average passenger journeys since franchising began in 1994, and the first year of the new timetable, in 2003. 'Nightmare' The Rail Fair report, called Nightmare For The Midlands: Passenger Travel In Lincoln, said: "It was already clear from the franchising process, but it is becoming even clearer with these figures, that the privatised railway is failing to create any meaningful improvement in passenger travel times in local communities. "We can no longer afford to be complacent about these problems as the 'race to the bottom' for new franchise contracts goes ahead. "Government is currently considering proposals for a new franchise agreement for services between Nottingham and Lincoln that will see private companies bidding to extend franchise services from Derby. This is already taking place on the
