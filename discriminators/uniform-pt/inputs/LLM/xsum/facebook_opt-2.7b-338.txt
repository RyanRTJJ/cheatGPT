 of the season," said McCoist. "It was the first time in recent history that Rangers had managed to win four or more in a row.

"To be honest, we knew we were well in this," he added. "Then we won the [Scottish] Cup final. It then became obvious. Our confidence is sky-high. It would be a massive mistake to play down our achievements this season.

The Ibrox team's league form is as good as it has been since they were last crowned champions in 2010 and is good enough to allow them a fair idea of the gap in quality between themselves and the rest when it comes to playing the bigger games. They still fear no side but they are not without fear: this weekend sees them face one of the big guns of European club football – Bayern Munich.

That is something Rangers have been looking forward to for years but McCoist says it is not a one-off for his side. "The Champions League group stage is a two-legged tie but, because it is in this way, the away-goals rule can be an issue," he said.

"If Bayern come to Ibrox and get an away goal, then a lot of the time they'll come back in the second game when they have more home support. So we've got really good experience of coming to Europe and away games to come, which will give us a massive advantage come the knockout stage."

The German Bundesliga champions have a habit of getting big-name players involved too. "The likes of Thomas Muller, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery – there are always going to be good players involved," said McCoist. "We've got experience of playing games of this level and, when we go away and are under the pump, we know how to work hard."

McCoist is right. It is a quality they will need to replicate this weekend if they are to hold their own against one of the best teams in modern football.
