 would have to provide funding to staff.

Mr Clarke said it was not clear why he did not use the Labour-Green deal for a health secretary instead of a health secretary at Westminster. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde would have been set up as a regional health board at the time and had more resources for frontline care, he said.

An alternative health secretary would not necessarily have been a Labour or SNP elected official.

Labour has said it would keep health and social care at the heart of any future government. But he said there was no "magic bullet" and the health and social care budget in 2017/18 would be much higher than in 2018/19 which had more than double 2014/15.

Our ruling


On Thursday, Mr Hammond said his party would work to save health and social care after the NHS was forced to declare a loss.

The health and social care budget in 2014-15 fell by Â£35m. As a result, staff in public hospitals will now be asked whether they need to do more with less in the summer months, for example, or if they are willing to reduce the number of people they treat the winter months. It may mean less nurses.

While he said not having two parties had meant he could work with all the other parties, he was clear in his assessment of the issue.

We rate Mr Hammond's statement Mostly True.
