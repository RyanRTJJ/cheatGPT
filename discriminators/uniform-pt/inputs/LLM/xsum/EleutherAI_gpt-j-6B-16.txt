Schools must be proactive. It is not enough to wait until a storm of a certain intensity strikes and then hope for the best. As a country we must demand that schools be resilient and we must also learn to make our schools resilient. Resiliency takes three forms:

1) Preparedness: Schools should have plans for their most likely disasters and know what to do in each case. This should include having plans to cover emergencies such as power loss, fire, and loss of heating or other essential services. Schools should have plans for evacuating, sheltering and caring for those left behind. Many emergencies are unpredictable so an emergency plan must cover many different contingencies.

2) Recovery: After the disaster it is vital schools prepare for both short term recovery and the reconstruction after the emergency has passed. Preparation of this sort often will take time and the school must be ready to function even after the emergency has passed but the school needs to be able to return to some aspects of normal operations for at least a time.

3) Reinforcement: It is vital for schools to be vigilant of their physical and economic environment. Often times the very disasters that need to be prepared for can severely impact schools. Schools should be prepared to have enough fuel to run their generator but also to be prepared in case it is not needed. It also must be planned to have sufficient food for students and staff for a while if the worst were to happen.

These policies can be implemented without making schools any more expensive or demanding more money from taxpayers. Schools are in fact already overburdened with funding problems and so to address these three policies simply makes our schools much more resilient to the effects of emergencies in the first place. The time to act is now for our children’s safety.

We are so excited for our community to be the very best. With that, here are a
