According to the company, Amazon Post is a low-cost courier service powered by automated vehicles for urban parcel delivery. In this pilot, the company has used drones loaded with packages and a special container to collect the packages from the recipient’s mailbox.


During the trial Amazon’s drone operator guided the aircraft and controlled its velocity and altitude. After arrival of the package at destination, an Amazon post van collected the container and returned to the Amazon distribution centre for the pick-up process.

Amazon Post claims on its website: “Postage delivery with drones has been an aspiration since we started Amazon but until now it was technologically challenging to do quickly, safely and reliably. Today, with state-of-the-art technology and through extensive research and development, we’re taking the initial commercial step towards realizing this vision.”

Possible use cases mentioned on Amazon’s website include delivery of last-mile parcels to a single customer or for packages requiring overnight delivery.


Drone delivery is also seen as a possible solution for the Postal Service to extend home delivery service into smaller rural towns, where residents have historically been unable to reach major delivery centres with a car.

According to DroneDJ, an online drone tracking and tracking service, Amazon and Google have each spent more than $10m in the past year and a half on research into urban drone delivery technology.

According to Amazon’s website: “Every package Amazon Post makes is tracked. This allows us to better understand the performance of our packages and our network of drop sites, and to better inform improvements to our service.”

The company also said that no data from the testing is shared with other retailers or third-party organisations. Amazon has developed a patent for its drone delivery method and currently uses drone technology for small-scale delivery of packages in its own Prime Air service.

Amazon has also previously discussed developing an air taxi to ferry passengers from airports around the world.
