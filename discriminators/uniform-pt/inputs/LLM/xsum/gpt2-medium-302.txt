14 on its services to the island of Bantry.

A spokeswoman from Visit Wales said: "This is a time of real difficulty in the island's future and, with the UK's population coming under serious pressure, there is mounting pressure on public services and government expenditure.

"Since 2009-10, we have built a number of new and refurbished schools to serve the new migrants taking their first steps."

Visit Scotland spent £40m in its first five years on Bantry, while Visit Wales spent £32.8m.

The Isle of Man is due to spend less than half as much - £28m - this parliament on services to migrants from south and central Europe. However, the Government is keen to push its total spending towards more than £150m, saying it needs to make "special provision for the more desperate".

The Office of National Statistics, which measures net migration, estimates that the UK has attracted around a million net new arrivals in the last few years - more than the number of net refugees that arrived by plane from Iraq, Syria and Eritrea in that period.

One recent analysis has suggested that if the net migration figures kept up, then by the end of this parliament the UK may have lost 2.5m net permanent and "first time" migrants.

Migrants travelling to Britain from EU countries in 2015 will have a lifetime cap of 3,000 days, the government said: "It is this migration cap that will be decided this parliament from our own statistics."

It added: "It is wrong for the Government's net migration target not be linked to our general net migration numbers in the year ending September 2014 - this will have a negative contribution to GDP over a longer period than is currently being recorded."

There's no doubt the debate for the new immigration policy comes before the autumn. For the first time since the EU took out its controversial quota system the public debate has been focused on net migration. There are clear political costs to immigration, but is it worth raising the bar so far?

The point we have to get across here is that the big picture picture of the impact
