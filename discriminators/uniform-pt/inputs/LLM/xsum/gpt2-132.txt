 treatments that will help the most at-risk for serious side-effects.

Researchers from Columbia University, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard School of Public Health conducted the study at 11,700 patients. They recruited more than 20,000 participants in England from more than 50 universities, including at least 1.5 million people in the US and around the world.

The group also studied 3,000 patients hospitalized for respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, while performing a battery of tests including blood or urine tests and the same measure used for screening for HIV.

Researchers found a correlation between lung cancer rates (lower numbers) and an individual's BMI (body mass index (BMI), which is measured at a height which equals the height of the body compared with the height of a typical human) and that of physical activity â€” whether or not people were taking aerobic exercise or a variety of other activities.

The number of people on either condition also reduced for some people who were at risk of getting cancer, but were not at risk of becoming seriously ill. The study concluded: "Although our study suggests a positive association between smoking and lung cancer, the results also suggest that this association may be understated, at least through consideration of these health effects, which may be outweighed by other outcomes."

The study looked at four cohort studies measuring the risk of lung cancer in a large population followed by 12 years and 9 years for people who were at risk for HIV, hepatitis, and related conditions.

People with the highest prevalence of HIV tended to have lower lung cancer risks. For lung cancer risk, those with the highest smoking levels had higher lung cancer rates.

Among the factors that were protective (higher rates of C-reactive protein, a protein that regulates our immune systems), higher average BMI, and body fat were not associated with lung cancer.

Overall, lung cancer risk was higher among those who smoked (hazard ratio, 0.99) and were not smoking (hazard ratio, 1.03) compared with those who were.

But a second factor, the association among smoking and lung cancer, remained significant. Among those who were on an anti-HPV program or who ate a diet high in cholesterol levels, there were no other
