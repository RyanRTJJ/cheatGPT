 said a review had established the jail was "no longer the safe place it had once been". She added that the death of two women was "deeply troubling for our nation".

A report by the Prison Reform Trust (PRT), released this week, revealed allegations of rape by guards of a number of women inmates.

There will be an investigation into the rape claims, but Mrs May insisted: "This would not affect any operational decisions". They do "not represent the view of this government", she told MPs.

"We think it's right that people, including survivors and victims' families, should be heard. It's about safeguarding the women in custody, and that really is what this is about".

The Government's chief whip, Mark Lowden, defended the decision to hold a Commons debate on Friday.

The BBC understands the debate will be conducted under the title "Tackling Violence in Prisons in the British Army".

There are also questions about where the money allocated for the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) will be spent by the Government.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) had allocated £2bn to prisons and security services - but only £2.7bn towards security budgets, the Ministry of Justice says. That leaves £1bn out of the £4bn MoJ is entitled to spend on security.

In a statement, a Ministry of Justice spokesman said, "Prisoner numbers are currently significantly less than the minimum required by the Government. All departments, including the MoJ and HM Prison Service, are working with the Government to increase the figure in the future. As the current Government does not require an increase in the prison population, the Government's decision to not require an increase to that figure means that overall there will be a reduction in prisons".

The Government's latest figures for the prison population are expected to be published on October 19.
