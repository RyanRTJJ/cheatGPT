 the conclusion that she will not face any charges.

The jury was asked to consider, among other things, that the woman has a history of serious drug offence. One man had been found guilty of possession of a controlled substance that she admitted to, while two others had been found guilty of possessing a heavy substance.

The jury took between three and nine hours to read the evidence and was told it would be about "any other matter that came up, and not one of which I think is of particular priority".


One juror said they would still not agree what was to be done but said it would still be "very, very important", as there are many questions to be answered about drug consumption in Ireland.

'Brief and moving' witness

Another trial witness – an academic lecturer who also spent time before the court the day of the hearing – was one of the jurors who had deliberated earlier that day. She said she had been advised by Dr Michael Sajes who sat with the jurors that "nothing's been seen from Dr Sajes about her experiences with drugs during the trial".

In the closing arguments of the hearing it appeared that the jury had seen only one aspect of the trial.

A third jury heard from an unnamed juror who thought Dr Sajes had "a hand in some drug use". The juror was told that since she took part there had no need for evidence as the case was closed. She suggested that she will be referred by a member of the jury to have some of her own evidence heard before the jury.

After listening her testimony, one juror recalled a discussion with Dr Sajes over taking pills during the trial, saying that they had talked to her about her past drug habit, and would give her some ideas on how she could continue making it.
