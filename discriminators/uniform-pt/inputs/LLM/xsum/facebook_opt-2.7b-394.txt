The hearings were scheduled to begin in London on July 18, 2014. The Department for Education ordered a change of venue for these hearings without providing a reason.

The family's legal team appealed, arguing that since the Ministry of Justice's decision had been made without any regard to the "precedence or tradition" of the hearings, the judgment would need to be set aside.
