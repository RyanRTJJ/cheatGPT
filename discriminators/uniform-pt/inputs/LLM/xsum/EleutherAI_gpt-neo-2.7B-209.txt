 time the micro-lending initiative in South Asia has gone international and has encouraged the UK to follow suit.

The loan scheme involves young people from vulnerable backgrounds, who are between the ages of 18 and 22. The initiative has been set up in 2009 by GCU’s Centre for Enterprise and Innovation.
