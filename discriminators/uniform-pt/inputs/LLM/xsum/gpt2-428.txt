 it over to UEFA," said Paul-François Nardel, a former adviser to the European Football Confederation (EFC). "We've also given them the sanction."

He said officials at the FIFA congress would "be on alert until we received a more formal answer" about the issue and had been briefed on matters by all nine members. "We expect the case will have to deal with the case, which may extend into the future. We certainly don't expect it to end up with the same outcome as what happened at the 2012-12 tournament."

It was not immediately clear whether Fifa would agree to an emergency deadline of this past April 25 for the investigation, or to consider suspending this until after an end date of October 1 next year.

The former head of FIFA's governing body, Paulo Coentrao-González, on Thursday made it clear that "the investigation will continue". "We will continue fighting against any violations of Fifa regulations on corruption and any attempt to hinder the outcome of the proceedings," he said.

The issue was not new and coincided with the Fifa World Cup in South Africa to end a two-year investigation into corruption at the top of the world's governing body.

However, in October, a former top official with Fifa's executive committee told reporters it was difficult to get the investigation over. "Everyone on the committee believed that if FIFA was to find the wrongdoing, it was most likely to be sanctioned," said Carlos Castillo, vice commissioner of the European FA and a former Fifa executive who is among eight former head coaches, managers and others facing fines from FIFA over the cheating scandal.

But an internal investigatory panel of about a dozen men and women, including former referees, representatives of referees' associations and representatives of the league's executive committee of 12 international sporting bodies, was set up to look into the case.

However Mr Coentrao-González denied any wrongdoing and said he and other Fifa members agreed "to cooperate on the very same legal issues."

That did not stop supporters and
