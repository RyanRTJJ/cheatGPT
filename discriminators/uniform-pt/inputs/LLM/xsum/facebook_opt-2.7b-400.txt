Annie McCallum and Margaret McManus have been shortlisted in the Scottish Book Awards for their debut Young Adult novel, An Ordinary Girl.

The other nominees in the category were John McIlvanney (For My Lovely Wife), Margaret Grieve for A Fine Lady to Come and Ailbhe Smyth.

Alfred McEwin was named fiction writer of the year and the late Alan McCaw literary lifetime achievement award went to Anne Gillet – her work was described as “incisive” and “engaging”.

The winners will be announced at the festival on Saturday and an open evening is being held, followed by a prize giving dinner.

The two runners up in the fiction – John Paton for A Time for Chalk and Angela M. Williams for The Last King of Scotland – have been invited to read with Stephen Fry at the Royal Festival Hall.

The winner of the drama writer of the year award was announced as Richard Wilson for The Last King of Scotland, while the short fiction award was won by Ian Rankin for his third story collection In Sickness and in Health.

The winners in the children’s and young people’s books category were Anne Gillet for White Rose, Sarah Perry for You Are Here, and Lisey Landon with The Golden Compass.

Also the Scottish Poetry Society Prize for poetry went to David Whyte for Merely an Ordinary Man.

Award judges said Ian Rankin took the “extraordinary step of breaking the conventions of historical fiction” with his new story collection set in the 1970s. It was described as “a remarkable achievement”.

John Paton has won an international award for his short story The Land I Love. It was also announced as shortlisted for the Orange Prize for fiction. The short story anthology is called The Yellow Wallpaper and stars the likes of Mary Beard, Iain Banks, Virginia Woolf, John Berger, Evelyn Waugh and Elizabeth Gaskell.
