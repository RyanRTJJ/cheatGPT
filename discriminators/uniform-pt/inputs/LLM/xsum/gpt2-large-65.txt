Michael Scott is being held at the Benton County Jail on a $10,000 (Â£6,400) bond.

Police have not made any statements about their investigation into the cause and manner of Scott's death.

"We were saddened to hear of this tragic accident and our loved one was a loving mother, sister & aunt to all three of our children," Scott's aunt Wendy Scott said in a statement.

At the family's home just outside West Palm Beach on Monday, Scott's older brother, Todd Scott, said the family was "saddened to learn that she was taking pain medication but, she seemed fine".
