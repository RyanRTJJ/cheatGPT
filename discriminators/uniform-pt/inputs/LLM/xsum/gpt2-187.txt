 Paul Kelly has enjoyed the game for the last 15 years.

In 2014, with captain Kelly as captain, he moved to the New Zealand side along with two fellow seam bowler, Steven Wright-Phillips and left-handed bowler Nathan Lyon.

Huddersfield Town has been linked with the England Under-19 World Cup debutant - but they rejected a deal to sign him.

Kiwis United boss Tim O'Brien said: "A deal was agreed with the Wigan Supporters Club in London for Paul Kelly to be the captain of Kiwis U 19s. He continues to play his part in the team. It will be an exciting start for him and we all look forward to the future of him."

New Zealand international Kelly, 31, and former New Zealand cricket captain Johnathan Thurston are not expected to return to the side and no club other than United have signed their top batsman.

Kiwis have no other international signing and are still looking for a replacement for Steve Smith. But having signed in 2013 from West Indies, the West Indies have no international signing in the form of Smith.

In the 2012 NAB Challenge final against France, Kelly won the first two Tests and the only major-league Test to win a single day and was named the best player of 2013 by England's scouting team, the OSCA.
