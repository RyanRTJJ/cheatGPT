"In order to make Skype's video processing efficient, we've enabled the default profile that Skype uses when operating in this environment," Microsoft says. "As in the past, Skype's video processing algorithm does not scale in this scenario. In Skype for Windows 8.1, videos are split in multiple threads with each thread being capable of processing different inputs at different speeds. This causes our video processor and videos to overheat and cause video quality to drop rapidly."

We have zero doubt that many of you would like Skype video quality to be up to par with the rest of the Windows operating system, and indeed many of us do. With this update, we are able to improve Windows 10 support without a software change.
