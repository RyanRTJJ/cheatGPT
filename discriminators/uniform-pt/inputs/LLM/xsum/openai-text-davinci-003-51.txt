 first team at the start of July, with a highest score of 37 in 11 Championship appearances, after hitting 1,352 runs from 28 matches in 2016.

This season has been a difficult one for Hameed, with his average dropping to 27.20 in the Championship and 32.08 in the One Day Cup. He has been unable to push on at the rate he was expected to, with just one fifty in seven County Championship knocks.

However, Lancashire believe that Hameed can still be an important member of their team and that he just needs time to regain his form.

The club's head coach, Glen Chapple, said: “We know Haseeb Hameed has lots of talent. He simply needs the confidence, enthusiasm and mental strength to get back the scores we all know he’s capable of.

“We have a good number of batsman on our books, but Haseeb is a very special player who has great potential and he will be used carefully to help him to convert this talent into scores.”

Hameed is currently working closely with England batting coach Mark Ramprakash in an effort to rediscover his best form. The pair have been working on technical and mental aspects of his game and Lancashire hope that he will soon be back among the runs.

For now, Hameed is likely to be given time to get back to his best before being thrust back into the Lancashire line-up.
