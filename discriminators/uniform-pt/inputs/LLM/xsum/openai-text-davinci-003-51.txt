3.8% in the past year to record levels, with 1.506 billion journeys taken on the rail network in 2017. The jump was the biggest since records began in 1997.

The rail network carried 4.6 billion tonnes of freight during the period, up 3.2% year-on-year, while freight volumes at ports also rose by 1.7%.

The figures were welcomed by the group, which said rail was “a vital component of the UK economy” and an essential part of the nation's infrastructure.

"We are delighted to see such significant increases in the numbers of people and the volumes of freight travelling by rail in the UK this past year," the group said.

"This resurgence in our rail network is very welcome and a clear indication that the industry is responding to our continued drive to improve the customer experience, increase capacity and find ways to make our railway more affordable and reliable."

The government has committed to a "once-in-a-generation" investment programme in rail infrastructure, beginning with the go-ahead for HS2, a high-speed line connecting London and the Midlands. The group said that it was "encouraged" by the government's plan and said it was keen to work together towards delivering a modern, efficient, and customer-friendly rail network.
