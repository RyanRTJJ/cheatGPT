 kerb is about to go in the shed.

When the team moved from their £1.3million house in Chippenham into their large shed in the city's south coast their team bus broke down and a fire gutted their car and the bus itself went into the ground, they say. It's thought one of the bales had fallen onto each other.

All the team received a letter reminding them.

But there's more to the case. While they live in west London, there is a new bale centre being built - at the Royal Albert Hall where the team will now play under guard over their new turf.

The ground already is ready for them and the club has got two pitches ready to go for the start of the new season and will be playing for the National Lottery this October and the Football League in England in the summer of 2016.

It's worth pointing out they also received £10,000 from the government for the improvements to their stadium, another gift that has helped them overcome the storm surrounding their bid.

It also gives those playing for the team a lot to smile about given the conditions in the city surrounding the venue now.

The weather forecast this season to see 20 to 30C, however, is only a week away.

And that's something to smile about too - not that the NW200 won't have problems coping with any harsh weather - the weather is already causing many a break down on their team pitches.

"We were in the rain yesterday and it was such a good moment for the team," says captain Tom, 20, "It's been getting pretty annoying because when you hit the pitch it's really difficult to play. Just take a look at some of the fans there."

So it's also worth considering how close the team are to the pitch when they meet the club.

They have to wait at least a month for the new ground to go in because the first leg of their season in south London starts at the end of July. Even then, it's a waiting game, and there are many, many conditions to get the best you can from in the season opener.

But there are all the same fears
