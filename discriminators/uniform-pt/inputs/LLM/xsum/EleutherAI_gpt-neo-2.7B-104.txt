rice, a hilltop town of about 45,000 people, is an affluent one with good schools and shops. Its residents and businesses were devastated, in some cases to the extent that entire buildings collapsed, but many made it out alive. But not everyone who works and lives in Amatrice is immune. Two women at the paper where the cartoon is published have the same name as the two women who lost their lives in Amatrice: Rosa and Lucia. Their grief is evident in the cartoon.

The earthquake in Amatrice was a direct result of a string of natural causes: a fault that extends a quarter of a mile west from the one that caused the 7.5 magnitude quake in 2008.

It is also an inevitable result of our climate change in Italy.

According to various projections, Italy faces a 6--20% increase in sea level by 2050[@b1]. This could lead to a permanent 1 m increase of the sea.

In a country like Italy, with a population already affected by climate change, with people living on flat land, rising seas and increased flooding, this threat is dire.

When the sea rises on one side of the country, the other side is under water. When people move farther inland, they end up with more floods, and more houses underwater and at risk of bursting when the sea threatens to breach their property. In addition, sea levels on the sea are projected to rise by 2--4 m by 2100, which would cause an additional 20,000 deaths per year[@b2].

Climate change will most likely result in the development of new vulnerabilities for which we will have to develop or adopt appropriate coping mechanisms. The most obvious example is the growing vulnerability of cities in areas threatened by rising sea levels.

In Italy, the problem of sea-level rise has been growing over the years and there is increasing evidence of this issue. The Sea Levels Observing System has documented that the Mediterranean is changing in important ways, and that in the past,
