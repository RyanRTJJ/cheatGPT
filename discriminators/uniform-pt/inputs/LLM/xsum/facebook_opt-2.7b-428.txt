 we have the results of their tests with the help of FIFA. We are talking about about two samples of a total amount of about 250 grams," Vingadranath Padmanabhan, a lawyer representing the co-operation agreement, told The Indian Express.

According to Fifa, it has been testing the urine samples since May 2016 and found there was "no evidence to suggest" it had taken drugs. "We took a sample of urine from [the South African's] sample because we have been working under the pressure of the authorities (indicating by the way that it was the initial phase of the process) and [we wanted to be fully able to prove our evidence]. It is not a criminal case, we were never involved in criminal case. We have not been brought in a criminal case," he said.

Asked whether Fifa's "zero tolerance policy" on doping has any role in the case, he said the tests were carried out on "individuals rather than a team". "A doping control of an athlete does not involve the team. Only one individual can be tested at a time. We tested his sample on May 3 last year, then in August and again in December. There is no basis for allegation or controversy. This is an individual case," he insisted.

The fact that the three members — two Russians, the South African — tested positive after a three year period of "good anti-doping performance" can be termed suspicious, according to Padmanabhan. "It may be because of their age and the fact they are athletes from non-member countries [South Africa is a non-FIFA member country]. We are still waiting for the reports of blood tests of all the four [team] members, which will tell how much dope they consume. That will give the proper picture," the lawyer said.
