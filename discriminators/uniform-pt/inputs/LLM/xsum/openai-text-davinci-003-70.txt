 every 20 existing shares they hold in Lloyds Banking Group. 

In the lead up to the initial public offering, Lloyds Banking Group has set up an online offer website which allows interested parties to buy shares. It will also offer a retail offer of shares to smaller investors that do not already hold any shares in the bank. 

The group hopes to raise between £750m and £1bn from the share sale and is targeting a free float of at least 25%. The free float is a way of encouraging investment and liquidity in the newly listed bank, offering small investors a chance to benefit. 

By issuing free shares to small investors, Lloyds Banking Group is giving them a much-needed boost to their portfolios. This is especially beneficial for investors who do not have enough investment capital for outright purchases of shares. 

It is also important to note that the free shares issued to small investors will be subject to normal stock market risks. Therefore, buyers need to be aware of the associated risks and take appropriate steps to protect their investments. 

Overall, the floating of 25% of TSB by Lloyds Banking Group is a great way to bring in small investors. The free shares will offer them a great chance to get a foot in the door and benefit from the new opportunities offered by the newly-listed bank.
