 Arabs, Normans, and Spanish. Its people mostly have Italian, Arabic, and Spanish ancestries and are Catholic. The province's capital and primary city is Palermo, a major tourist destination, with over four million inhabitants. Palermo is built near a plain with steep mountains to the north, hills and an island to the south, and a coastline to the west.
A small part of the island of Sicily, the Palermo metropolitan area is the second wealthiest region of the country and the region with the highest living standards in Italy. It also has one of the highest living standards in Europe's most populated area. The coastal metropolitan area includes the comune of Palermo, which had around three million inhabitants.
The Italian Mafia has significant influence in Palermo and the whole region of
Sicily. Despite the current efforts of various anti-Mafia associations to eliminate Sicilian mafia and to promote the culture of

Palermo is known as the 'Marble City' of Italy, because of the quantity and quality of its public and private buildings and structures.
