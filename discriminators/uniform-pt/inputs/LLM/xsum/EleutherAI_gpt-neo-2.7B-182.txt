 Mike Tindall, now the head coach of Wales at the 2016 Rio Olympics and an International Rugby Board (IRB) vice-president, warned the sport faces more damage.

With Britain hosting the 2017 London Commonwealth games and a similar event in the USA within the two years, more than 500,000 spectators and 12 million viewers of Premiership rugby are set to make the journey, along with 10 million viewers of Champions League and the Rugby Football League (RFL's other elite-level competition).

"We are facing a period of turbulence and challenge," Tindall, a former British and Irish Lions and British & Irish Lions head coach and two-time Rugby World Cup winner, told a British newspaper last month. "We have to build a new basis for an international game that can flourish and be sustained in a sustainable model. I would say that rugby is heading for what I would call a collapse."

The RFU has been criticised in recent years for a number of perceived failings. Yet the governing body has made substantial changes to the game over the past decade; it merged the unions in 2006, moved international and club-based competitions to a wider 48-game calendar in 2013, and set up a commission last year to look at changes needed for the game to flourish in the era of globalisation.

It is now in discussions with the English rugby union body the RFU Union about the next phase, in which the union is looking to the sevens game over the next 15 years as a model.

"That's the model that I really believe, and it's the model that all of international rugby as a world sport should be working towards and has been for a long time," Tindall said. "This is the model that the IRB is using to look at the international game and identify new models and how we can take the game forward."

Tindall, who had been scheduled to be the chief executive of the English rugby union body from 2016 to April 2019 before he was replaced by former England rugby sevens player Andy Coghlin,
