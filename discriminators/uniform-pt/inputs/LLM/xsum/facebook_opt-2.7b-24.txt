 “worrying”.

In a statement, the Department for Education said it has invested £10 million to increase the numbers of nurses and health care assistants in NHS schools nationally. It added that it would be setting up a new nursing and health partnership with GPs in schools.

But the Royal College of Teachers’ general secretary Sally Hunt said there is a lack of experienced nurses trained in schools.

She said: “There’s a national shortage of qualified nurses throughout the education system. We need to ensure that schools are prioritised, especially at this present time, to ensure that they have access to the staff and resources they need to take care of children.”

Dr Louise Smith, who works as a paediatrician in Swansea, said one of her patients has a daughter attending a school in Carmarthenshire.

She described the situation there as “worrying” and said the school is not getting enough nurses, but said she understands GPs will be able to pick up the workload.

“There is a crisis everywhere. What happened in Swansea happened before the crisis. It doesn’t matter where it is happening, it’s not acceptable as a doctor to walk in and not be able to do your job,” she said. “We’ve been working around the clock to get our workloads right. We have been working out of hours, nights and weekends and that is not acceptable to us.”

Ms Hunt said the college is calling for the government to fund the nurses that are needed. She said: “One of the issues of teacher shortages and of course this has been magnified by the school closures is that the problem has been in schools over a number of years, which leaves children disadvantaged both in terms of staffing and in terms of the availability of specialist nursing care and education to the children.”

Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said earlier this week that an extra 1,500 health and care assistants were
