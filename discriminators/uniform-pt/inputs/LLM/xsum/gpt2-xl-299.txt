 that the software used to remotely control plant systems contained no vulnerabilities."It's clear that there is a significant impact on [the] nuclear power plant, and we've been closely monitoring the situation and closely cooperating with the local government," said Yongbum Chung, chief of the unit managing the cyberattack at Seoul's Defense Science and Technology Agency, adding that the agency would conduct a complete analysis before deciding what kind of further measures to take."We also plan to make sure that nuclear plants are equipped with cybersecurity-related systems," he said.On Monday, the National Assembly passed a bill creating an independent panel to study whether to ban the operation of nuclear power plants that can't guarantee safety within 15 years. The government has been considering such a measure for years, and experts said the bill has the chance to be considered for final approval.Currently, 40 plants can't guarantee such safety, and 40 can't guarantee it in 15 years.According to Yonhap, the hackers posted the data on the website of the company in possession of the information, causing the outage. South Korean and foreign nuclear industry experts said that South Korea has the technological capability to conduct cyberattacks on foreign plants with the right hardware and software.In 2014, South Korea began a three-year effort to install software that would help defend it against cybersecurity threats, aiming to make it more difficult for foreign hackers.In May 2011, South Korea signed a deal with the United States to allow it to conduct cyberwarfare and secure its infrastructure with high-tech equipment, according to local media reports.The North used a similar tactic in 2011 to attack the Office of the President and the National Intelligence Service. The country's cyberattack was designed to gather information on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.The attack sent shockwaves across the Internet, and the Seoul government announced that a "state-sponsored" cyberattack had hit its information
