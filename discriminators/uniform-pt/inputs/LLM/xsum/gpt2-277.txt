degree murder. Police on Tuesday said Mr Gray had "a very violent history" but he was not in danger.

Mr Goodman had been working on a project to build new housing on a south-side street in the south of Austin, and it was the city's first fatal police shooting.

The man's bloodied body was found in the back seat of an unmarked car during a morning drive last month by a man who later confessed to the deadly assaults.

Police said he stabbed Mr Gray in the face with a knife and fled with his car. Mr Gray had told police he believed Mr Goodman wanted to kill him.

Mr Goodman also had reported to an earlier meeting that he had been at Mr Martinez's home, but police said they had no reason to believe that was the case at the time.

Mr Goodman's home in the suburb of Greenfield has been burgled

Mr Gray has faced numerous police inquiries after the assaults.

A group calling itself the Black Lives Matter movement has been organizing outside police headquarters to condemn police brutality in the city.
