 Scott had tried to strangle herself in the last couple of hours. She had been suffering from severe abdominal pains and no indication of distress.

The funeral for Scott will be attended by the South Africa national rugby team, who visit Kingston on Tuesday. She was contracted to the country but did not represent them for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against England, Canada and Northern Ireland when she left the sport early this campaign.

Her death is yet another blow to the rugby world ahead of the World Cup. It comes a fortnight since a young mother who died after suffering from depression, who was contracted by the country, collapsed in a home.

She also had one daughter.

Sue Dines-Makin, the South Africa rugby minister, said on Monday that a memorial service was due. "She was a caring, dedicated and selfless woman and I would like to remember her by spending the evening with her loved ones, and as a member of her extended family, I offer my sincere condolences," she said in a statement. "The South African rugby community is deeply saddened and we will do all we can to offer a full and supportive inquiry of the cause of death."

Meanwhile, a spokesman for the team said their thoughts were with Scott's family, who are also in the United States to attend an Ashes series match. "She was a talented person, loved children and was beloved by her family. My thoughts and prayers are with her family at this difficult time," the spokesman, Aaron Brown, said.

Scott leaves friends at the home. "She was a beautiful person but that's not really what I'm looking at; she was a beautiful person," her son Joe said.

A former high school friend said: "The way she started off as a good person, just a nice, down-to-earth person, then the depression she was in was totally out
