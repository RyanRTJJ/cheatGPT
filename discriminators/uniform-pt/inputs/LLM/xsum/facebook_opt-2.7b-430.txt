 that comments like "I don't care, I don't have a problem with the idea that there's some serious people, somewhere, who want to harm us" could lead to disciplinary action.

The staff then penned a memo explaining that "our aim is to be an advocate for the security and privacy interests of the Government and, by doing so, to use social media to be able to do this". They added: "We shouldn't be cowed into silence where we can be the force for good that we ought to be. What we're being asked to do is to say, for example, that there is a real risk to the nation, as I've said. We need to be able to say that."

The email added: "We must also be able to say that there is a real risk to individuals, as I've said. We need to be able to say that, that's the point, and not be able to say it."

The memo ends: "We must be as robust in defence of what we believe as we can be in saying it. We must be able to say it as we see it, rather than what we're told to say, or fear to state. We want to be able to share our opinions."

In an email to staff, Public Service Commissioner David Shoebridge said the policy had not been in place overnight and that an internal investigation has started.

"It is simply unacceptable that staff have been asked to compromise their belief that the public interest might warrant freedom to speak and the Government is unable to accept this, as we believe it is."

The investigation comes after a Twitter storm about government surveillance. Prime Minister David Cameron told BBC Two's Andrew Marr show that the debate had "clearly upset some people".

"I have actually been through almost every agency that's involved in surveillance and eavesdropping of communications and had no knowledge, no knowledge whatsoever of what that agency was doing," he said. "And I would ask the security services to be able to act with the same integrity, the same accuracy, the same accuracy with any other communications that they intercept."

Ministers have defended government surveillance practices, but have not denied any spying on phone lines
