Mr Grayling said it was "shameful" the government had no plans to crack down on gang-related violence and drug-dealing.

'Worthwhile investment'

Sadiq Khan, who was elected as the city's first Muslim mayor in May, told the BBC it was "shameful" gang culture had taken hold, but said many "innocent youths" were caught up in the violence.

Shadow policing minister Jack Dromey said the report was "extremely disturbing" and called on the government to get tough with gangs.

"Police are spending less time on crime prevention and dealing with the consequences of gang criminality - that is not what they are there for," he said.

And Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said he hoped the government responded positively to the report.

"Despite everything else they could have done to try and prevent a wave of violence in our inner-city areas, the government has instead invested less in the police, in the youth services and in the community," he said.

"I hope this report will help them reconsider the ways their approach to policing has failed."

Speaking to BBC News before the publication of the figures, Mr Grayling defended his department's response to youth violence at the height of the recession.

The Home Office budget for the police had fallen to Â£721m in 2010, and Mr Grayling said that had "put enormous strain on many of the forces across the country".

"In the last two years we have significantly increased the number of police officers patrolling the streets and put them into some of the most high-risk areas," he said.

"We have made some significant changes, including a new policy of tackling first referral units - which are local policing teams focused on high-volume offending and crime.

"And we continue to put significant money into a national programme of work to help the families and communities involved in gang crime to turn their lives around."
