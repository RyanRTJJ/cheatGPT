Tata Steel announces closure of Corby blast furnace

Tata has pledged £3m to assist the creation of around 200 new jobs “as a result of the closure of its steelmaking business in the UK”.

The company said the remaining 700 employees will be given appropriate training, including apprenticeships, and will be offered transferable skills to other Tata Steel sites.

North Lincolnshire Council leader, Councillor Peter Hill said: “This proposal will not satisfy everyone. There are jobs that will be lost and we will be looking closely at what the council can do to support the jobs and the workforce in a way that works to the benefit of both.”

Councillor Sandra Hazlewood added: “We will be working with Tata and its stakeholders in the region to ensure they have the right support and guidance.

“It is crucial that we get a good deal from this announcement - the economic and social stability of the district will depend on it.”

The news comes after the closure of the Corby blast furnace in Northamptonshire at the end of December.

The company said that it was making “steady progress towards delivering” a plan to close its operations at the site.

Councillor Alan Carter, Leader of Northamptonshire County Council, said in a statement: “We have long said that Tata Steel’s closure of its Corby blast furnace would damage Northamptonshire economy and we were therefore very pleased that Tata Steel announced that they were to invest in the economic development of the area
