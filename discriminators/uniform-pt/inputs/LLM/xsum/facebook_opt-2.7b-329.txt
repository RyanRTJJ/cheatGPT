 the pair. A spokesperson for the Yorkshire Ambulous Aid Collective said: ''Yesterday an experienced mountaineer and a young man tragically lost their lives in terrible weather conditions on Mount Washburn near Skipton. The conditions were such that the search was almost impossible, although the team worked to cover an area approximately equal to the height of the mountain. As such it would have been extremely difficult to search where the search grid was provided.'' Mr Newton was the son of retired West Yorkshire Police and Bradford Grammar School coach Alan Newton.

The couple have both worked for a local insurance firm and were planning to move to Canada to work. A spokesman for the couple's employer, St Andrew Building Society, said: ''The couple were very well liked by the staff, and they had worked with each other for some time. They were due to begin a new career overseas and the couple were very much looking forward to their move.

''There is one of our customers that is close to their hearts, and we feel very confident in saying that we will do our best to ensure that there are support services available for them.'' Neighbours said of the couple: ''They just moved to the area about six months ago and were making good progress in their jobs.'' Their father-in-law, Peter Newton, said: ''Alan and Rachel were very well loved members of our community who worked hard and played hard.'' The Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. Their mobile number is 07775 231697.
