With the combined market value of the two firms more than doubling to more than $140bn, industry experts said they expect Monsanto's offers would provide a boost to the combined company. Monsanto said it had made the proposal public at its request and that it did not intend to comment further.

Chemical and pharmaceutical companies such as Baxter, Pfizer and Sanofi are also buying out rivals.

The industry has been shaken up by European moves to ban some types of genetically modified (GM) crops, notably a move to ban GM milk and potatoes in the bloc. The EU last month ordered its member states to ban the export of unauthorised GM products.

The United States allows far more GM crops, while India recently launched its own plan to fast-track them. China meanwhile has so far banned more than 100 kinds of GM crops on national soil.
