 our grasp, with no guarantees of a title fight. And while the reigning champion Ferrari is yet to win, and the last driver in the French grid to make a world championship in less than three years, there is no doubt about the potential of an event of this magnitude in the early part of the 2015 season.

For now, however, this is the final road to a World Championship for Daimler, and for me, that was the only time I would ever want to see a title fight between a Formula One team from the Middle East and Canada.

Having lost my best friend's car over his car in a crash in the German flat in a crash between Ferrari and F1 last year, I am looking forward to watching the F1 event next year and hope to see those drivers get their chance next year. That championship is coming to Brazil (the very team that had become my love interest and car of choice for the last five years), at the moment the championship is running in Valencia.

I was fortunate enough to witness this happen one day earlier at the weekend in the city of San Sebasti√°n, so I will try to take it from here.
