 last year when around 25,000 migrants came through the Strait of Messina.

"The numbers have continued to increase," Frontex Commissioner Fabrice Leggeri said Monday. "This year we have no doubt we'll see many more migrants entering Greek waters."

In his latest forecasts, Leggeri said that the number of migrants who died trying to reach Italy at the eastern Mediterranean is expected to reach nearly 16,000 on Monday alone.

On Monday, the Italian navy, which commands the southeastern part of Sicily and is in charge of the islands' border with Libya, said that a ship from the country's southern coast had carried a total of 918 migrants from Libya.

"An additional ship with a maximum capacity of 715 people arrived at the country's southern island, which includes the Sardinia region," the navy said in a statement Monday.

The migrants are heading for the central Libyan coast.

'We are on the brink'

Migrants were still making their way on Sunday through the Sicilian island of Lampedusa onto smaller ferries that head north to Greece.

Meanwhile, on Friday, Frontex said it "doubtly will not be able to find a solution for these people until early next year."

"The situation of migrants is not sustainable," the agency said, adding that "over the last weeks, the number of people who are being apprehended has gone up dramatically."

According to Frontex, the number of people going via Libya to Italy at the end of last year was close to 70,000. Last month, the United Nations humanitarian agency for Palestinians reported the total number in Lebanon and Syria to be 80,000.

While officials try to send more assistance into Libya, activists say smugglers are sending migrants to Europe through other ways.

The International Organization for Migration says some 600 have died during the past month trying to cross the Mediterranean in overcrowded boats.
