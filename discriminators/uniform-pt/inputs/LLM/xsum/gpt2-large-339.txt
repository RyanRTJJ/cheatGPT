 arrested him as he was on the third day on his return to the city.

The judge, the defence and the prosecution then went to the court room to discuss the plea filed by Asghar, and it wasn't easy to maintain that he was a child or a youth when he said he wanted to go to Pakistan to get a job in the railways. Asghar said he was 17 and the same age as the others and also that he had a brother and three cousins.

The prosecution claimed Asghar was shot and injured from behind by an unnamed "gangman" who then left the cell and returned shortly after, while the defence claimed he was trying to escape and was injured by the officer.

The court will resume the hearing of the case on Wednesday.
