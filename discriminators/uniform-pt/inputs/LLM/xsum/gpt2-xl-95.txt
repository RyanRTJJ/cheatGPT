 which is covered in fur and eats fish, to be relocated.

The problem at first appeared to be food for the seal, only to be solved when researchers made a discovery.

One of the researchers, Alan Dabbs, said: "We found a dead fin at sea and then another."

"As we put on our fins there were about three or four of dolphins circling us, looking at us, and then the seal moved down below to look at us."

The researchers have been working with the Department of Environment to find a new home for the seal.

But the fishermen won't let it in.

The fisherman's union, in the hope of saving the seal's future and its livelihood, is campaigning to have it put on a boat.

Fishermen around Rutherglen, near Inverness, who spotted the seal have been told the seal will not be let on a boat if they do not give it the choice to go or not.

The Department of Environment said it is investigating the seal's behaviour.

Fisheries Minister Andrew Jones said: "The animal has defied the laws of nature and its actions are dangerous.

"I absolutely want local fishermen to respect local wildlife and for the best interests of the seal not to be put before the interests of Scottish society."

The Scottish government launched a "pilot project" in March to help anglers with their "fishing techniques".

The fishing community of Rutherglen, where the incident took place, said the seal was a familiar face and was seen on at least 15 occasions a day.

The spokesman said the decision to keep the seal off a boat was a decision not to give in to the animal's demands.

Mr Dabbs said: "For what it was worth, when we put it on the boat the seal began to eat fish right in front of us."

A spokeswoman for the Department of Environment confirmed the seal may not be allowed to go on board, but added: "It may be that we need longer to look at the case and make our decision."
