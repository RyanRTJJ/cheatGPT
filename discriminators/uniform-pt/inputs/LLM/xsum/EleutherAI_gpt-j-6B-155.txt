 add more meat and fat to their diet.

People on the high-fibre diet also showed improved mood, and had lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol than the low-fat dieters.

Study co-author Dr Catherine Collins, senior lecturer in metabolic medicine at the University of Surrey, said: "Our findings suggest that eating a low-fat, high-fibre diet could also help with the prevention of depression."

Dr Collins added that the findings may also be related to heart disease risk. "The link between low-level inflammation and heart disease has been known for some time, and it's possible that a healthy diet could influence this risk."

Another study, published today by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at the relationship between diet and the incidence of depression in 473 people, of whom 26% had depressive symptoms. The most recent dietary change was made more than a year before the assessment.

The researchers found that people who increased their meat intake reduced their risk of depression - this result was stronger when the research was conducted with people who had heart disease or stroke.

However, they are too early to draw conclusions about cause and effect - no link was found between an increase in fibre and a reduction in depression risk.

The findings of both studies were limited because the measures used to assess dietary intake were self-reported.

Researchers are currently conducting more comprehensive trials which will measure other aspects about the diets such as what particular foods were eaten, the nutritional balance of the overall diet, how long the diet changes lasted, and whether the effects of diets were seen long-term.

For now, Dr Collins recommends sticking to the guidelines of a Mediterranean diet - eat more fruit and vegetables, eat oily fish, and limit red meat, which has high saturated fat levels.

She said: "It seems to be a healthy diet, so if you can manage to stick to it then that is probably the best way of reducing your risk of depression.

"If you are struggling with the depression, then a
