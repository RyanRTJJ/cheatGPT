he rest leaving over the next three years. The island’s energy sector is currently supplied by the 66-megawatt (MW) power station, which was built in 1977 to provide electricity to the island.

In 2008, the government issued a policy called the Man Suka Policy which stated that the power station must be closed and replaced with renewable energy by 2021. This changing power source was meant to save money, reduce the environmental impact, and increase the efficiency of energy production. A study by the University of the West Indies also concluded that a shift to renewable energy would save customers about $5 million annually. The island also benefits from the surrounding ocean’s energy, as it is an ideal location for wave energy technology.

Offshore wind farms, solar projects, and other renewable energy projects are expected to replace the island’s aging power plant. This shift to renewable energy will enable Trinidad and Tobago to benefit from clean energy while also meeting their commitments regarding the Paris Agreement. Additionally, the move away from fossil fuels could result in improved air quality and reduced overall emissions.

Ultimately, the closure of the power station marks the end of an era and the start of a new chapter for the island nation. The shift to renewable energy will no doubt benefit Trinidad and Tobago in the long-term, as the island will be able to reduce energy costs and its environmental impact.
