It is an exciting time for Horne, who is looking to compete at her first Olympic Games. She has been part of Britain's squad since 2011, underlining her class in the track event, having taken part in the Europeans and Worlds.

"I am sure it will be a once in a lifetime experience and something very special. I am very proud to be part of the British Cycling team and I'm looking forward to pushing my limits in Rio."
