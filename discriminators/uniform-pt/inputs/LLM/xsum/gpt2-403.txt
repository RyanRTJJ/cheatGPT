Shane Williamson had to be taken down only after 25 for the last 12 Test series and all the time that it would take for Australia to break the record for wickets allowed to a batsman in a tour.

The visitors took the lead during the first innings against the Lions in Perth, and the Blues bowled just three wickets between them. In the second innings, Brendon McCullum hit a curt, six-ball over his stump at the crease. McCullum was picked off but not allowed to bowl in due to the wicket. The only player to have been allowed to bowl on five occasions in the Test series was the man bowled in at the Lions with 23 runs.

For Australia, there was no warning from the batsman at the start of the ball to the batsman for it to break the mark set against South Africa at home to Perth, and neither did any of the teams behind it come close to matching Australia's pace.

But it was not a match you were used to.

"It was one of the things that's very interesting, really," Australia chairman Joe Root said when asked about the win over the Lions. "It's a big game. If you come as fast as they are, it's very easy for them to get through. From an Australian standpoint, when you take the ball over and to your half, it looks really good.

"We've got a nice side of our bat. They've got the ball, they got no stop or no bowler, the ball flies to their crease, and the half is still pretty good. It's not the greatest game of our cricketing history."
