The Scottish Secretary, John Swinney, has called for better monitoring during Brexit "to prevent future threats from our own borders". However, Scottish Secretary Kezia Dugdale has also welcomed a referendum on whether to hold, and whether or not to leave, Britain's EU membership.

The Brexit campaign seems likely to be a direct response to the UK's decision to leave the European Union after triggering the June 23 referendum, which had the support of 40 per cent of British people.


On this point, Labour candidate Kezia Dugdale, who campaigned for Britain to stay in the single market, has told Radio 3's David Mitchell that the Leave campaign will be able to make significant gains in local and national politics.


"There's going to be a referendum that will have it on the table after all the things about Brexit," she said. "It means that we have a political party running an effective political message that there's a chance we could be able to win a majority in the council as to who gets to be our leader and then a big amount of that is going to focus on immigration and the kind of issues that will actually be on the public agenda."

For many, that is the outcome where it will be hard to tell what will happen next. For those on the back benches, it may simply be that Scottish MPs will have to accept that their government may not be interested in actually following their own party's policy to avoid another referendum.

But the chances of that happen is very low, as many people have already warned.
