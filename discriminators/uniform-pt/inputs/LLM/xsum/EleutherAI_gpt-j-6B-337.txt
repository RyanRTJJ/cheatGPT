Det Insp Stuart Carter, of Ealing cID, said: “This was a tragic accident resulting in the untimely death of a respected businessman at such an age.

“What led to him being struck on the streets of Ealing is unknown. But what is clear is that he was struck immediately after opening a cab door as the driver took exception to something the gentleman said to him. What is also clear is that the driver did not intend to harm him and was shocked and surprised by what had occurred.

“He left the scene of the collision and drove to East Acton where he parked in the street. He ran off to the local police station nearby and reported what had happened.
