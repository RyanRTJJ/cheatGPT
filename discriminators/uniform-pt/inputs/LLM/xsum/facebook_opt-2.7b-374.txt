er John Barclay (84) and prop Paul Lawes (82), with four conversions and two penalties, both dotted down twice.

The Blues had earlier opened the scoring with a try from wing Manu Tuilagi, converted by Dan Carter (16).

A further five points arrived when prop Joe Launchbury (49) and lock Scott Curry (51) dotted down, also converted by Carter.

But the home side were in damage limitation mode as the Bulls extended their lead thanks to a brace of Naiyaravoro tries.

First they were awarded a penalty for a deliberate knock-on, but the hooker was offside and Carter’s kick was out of play.

The following line-out was held up and Naiyaravoro made excellent ground to cross between two defenders at the far pole, before being pulled down in the tackle when bearing down on the line.

Then a well-rehearsed attack went awry and the ball was forced to go out of play again after the Bulls broke off the back of it.

After the restart there was more sustained possession from the hosts but no points could be gained.

The hosts were finally over the gain line but Carter’s first penalty, after another line-out infringement, was held.

There was now little pressure from the Bulls, although a yellow card for Nick Evans meant he could not take a hand-off when he might have scored, and the visitors went close through prop Paddy Jackson, who was held up when offside.

As a matter of course, the hosts were offside too and it had to end there.

It took a bit of a miracle to even get to 20 in the match, having trailed at seven-a-side.

But a well-executed hand-off from Jonathan Joseph gave Carter the room to stretch across the line for a try and the bonus point.

Meanwhile, the Blues lost fly-half Aaron Cruden with a broken rib in the 29th minute of their match against the Chiefs last weekend.

A yellow card for Chiefs lock Patrick Tuipulotu was converted, and the Blues were back on the back foot.
