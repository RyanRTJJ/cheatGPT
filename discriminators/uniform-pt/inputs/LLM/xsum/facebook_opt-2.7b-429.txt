 the North-East Armagh Regional Museum and Galleries are telling the stories of the heroes of both sides of the battle, in specially created exhibitions

Armorer Sergeant Tom Campbell of the Royal Irish Regiment, also known as ‘The Duke of Connaught’s Own’. He was killed on the third day of the battle.

Tom’s body was one of the very last brought back from the battlefield. He was just 26 at the time, of Ballinderry Parish in County Tyrone.

But by the time he had returned home he had earned the nickname of ‘The Duke of Connaught’s Own’, and he was known throughout the world for being a skilled sniper and a man who had lost six brothers on the battle field.

Tom was just 20 when he enlisted, at a time when women were not allowed to serve in the British Army.

In this exhibition – ‘Tom Campbell: The Duke of Connaught’s Own’, people can get together to experience Tom’s story and the role he played in the battle.

Also on show, at Craigavon Municipal Gallery, is ‘The Fighting Men of Belles Lettres’ – a collection of images chronicling the men who fought at the Battle of the Somme.

This exhibition has been brought together by the Northern Ireland Branch of the Imperial War Museum.

It features the stories of several of those who fought in the battle and captures their images as a tribute to the soldiers who fought there.

“This exhibition documents the heroism and valour of those involved in the Battle of the Somme, including both the regular soldiers of both teams and the irregular battalions that made the first serious use of cavalry and were highly effective in the opening of lines across the battlefield,” said Kevin McNaught, manager of Craigavon Municipal Gallery.

“These images demonstrate that the Somme battle was an epic event that shaped the future of warfare in France and the entire world.”
