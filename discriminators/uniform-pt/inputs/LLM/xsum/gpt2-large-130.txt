This week, the government announced "drone culling," and was reported by Reuters to be developing guidelines for deploying drones in battle.

Many people believe the technology -- particularly drones -- can help solve some of the problems plaguing the war in Syria and other parts of the Middle East, including civilian suffering, the possible use of chemical weapons, and human rights abuses being carried out by Islamist extremists.

Drones have already been used in Ukraine, Libya, and parts of Iraq.

But drone warfare has also come under scrutiny, as the United States struggles with the spread of Islamic extremists and has been struggling to stop the illegal trade of weapons from Syria to terrorists in the Middle East.

US drones may be used to target suspected terrorists, but the practice has also reportedly been employed by civilians in Iraq. While the US military denies that the use of drones by civilians was an issue, the practice has taken place in areas controlled by terrorists and therefore potentially illegal.

The United Nations estimated last September that 2 million civilian deaths and 250,000 injuries were reported in Syria since the country's conflict broke out in 2011.

In July this year, the Guardian and Channel Four claimed that US drones have also been used to launch attacks in the region, while the US-based human rights organization Reprieve said the United States uses "hospitable" Arab States such as Jordan to launch attacks.

"The number of civilian casualties from drone strikes has increased sharply," the watchdog group said.

A US defence official told the BBC that it was "unfortunate" that the reported drone attacks showed the practice of targeting militants was "inherently dangerous" and said the "country has a long tradition of avoiding the use of the weapon."

This is not the first time drones have been raised again after the United States. In December, a British woman named Amy Goodman suggested drones be used in the war in Yemen as
