's international trade policy with international partners, including US President Donald Trump, who are known for making unilateral trade deals

The contract is aimed at the UK's diplomatic corps, civil servants and trade officials - all of whom will be expected to help shape the post-Brexit UK and drive exports.

They will be expected to gain a thorough grounding in international trade issues, Britain's trade policy and international trade institutions, such as the World Trade Organisation.

The first issue on which the new government needs to find agreement is on what constitutes a trade deal, with many of the UK's trade partners insisting that there cannot be a deal until the issue is clarified in Britain.

The role of trade policy analysts is likely to be crucial, as the UK goes about negotiations to join new trade deals such as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta) that Canada is seeking.

The new role has been advertised by the International Trade Administration (ITA), one of the departments of the Treasury. According to the ITA, the contract is a five-week consultancy role and pays on a contract basis of between £250 to £425 per day.

The role will run from 13 July to 19 November.

Among the top priorities for the UK are to secure trade agreements with countries other than the US and Canada, such as Chile, Argentina and Australia.

The UK will also have to manage EU trade deals, including the UK's agreement with South Africa, where Britain is attempting to reduce tariffs on farming and protect the local car industry.

The UK's departure from the EU means the UK will also have a greater degree of freedom in deciding its trade policy to the detriment of European markets.

The UK's new trade policy brief states in its opening paragraph that: "The UK's negotiating position will be shaped by an ambitious trade agenda with a strong emphasis on developing new markets and increasing market access."

The contract is likely to have wide ranging implications for a new trade policy, particularly the government's ability to protect local businesses.
