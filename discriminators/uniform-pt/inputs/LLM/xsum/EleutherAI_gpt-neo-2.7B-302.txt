14 and had a surplus of £22m, while Visit England spent £34.2m on tours and visitor attractions and had a surplus of £2.4m.

By contrast, Visit Wales last year spent £16m a year on marketing, including the publicity for the 2017 visit, which generated a third of its £50m funding.

Pritchard said the government and Visit Wales were "committed" to finding the right model.

"We will be looking to the private sector to be creative in the way that they can support the Welsh Government to deliver a world class service," she said.

Pritchard said one option could be partnering with the UK tourist board to help fund the initiative.

A government spokeswoman said: "As a flagship event for the Welsh government this event provides opportunities to engage with tourists from around the world while celebrating the region's culture, landscape and traditions.

"It can be seen as a catalyst for further marketing of Wales by providing an opportunity for people to learn more about Wales through engaging with the host. It helps generate further business for Visit Wales which is then used to support development in further regions and further the Welsh economy."

The event will take place on 4-5 April 2017 at Cardiff Castle. See www.visitwales.com.
