) guideline for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity a week.

It is well established that moderate physical activity, such as cycling, walking or doing light home gardening, is better than little or no physical activity at all. The WHO also recommends that adults take at least 150 minutes per week of “moderate” activity - including at least 150 minutes of activity they enjoy, or that they enjoy doing “moderately”. For example, a brisk walk or light gardening can all count as “moderate activity”, along with activities like going for a walk to the shop, gardening, housework and walking the dog.

“We’ve long known just what happens when we don’t get more exercise; it’s not a nice thing to think about – but now there is good evidence to show precisely what happens,” said Professor Jonathan Bayly, director of the UN Population Division, which led the research team. “One of the key messages of the research is that everyone and everyone is entitled to an active lifestyle – you don’t have to be an athlete to get the health benefits,” said Prof Bayly.

It has been clear ever since the WHO guideline was published in September that physical activity levels need to be much higher than 150 minutes per week for women and men. There was some early evidence to suggest that it would take more than 150 minutes of moderate activity a week to protect against the negative health effects, but the new research builds on the previous findings and suggests that there needs to be substantial increases in physical activity levels for the most important health benefits.

The UN Population Division’s work brings together and supports international efforts to understand the global trends and determinants of healthy ageing, including physical activity trends globally. The research team is also working to understand the factors affecting global physical activity trends and the determinants of physical activity for
