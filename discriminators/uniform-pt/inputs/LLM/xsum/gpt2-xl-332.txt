000, but the lowest percentage of cases acted on and the lowest proportion of customers who got their questions answered about their energy issues.


Scottish & Southern Energy was number one on customer service, with a complaint performance rate of 97.4 per cent. The only two firms on the table that trailed Scottish Power was Scottish Hydro at 92.6 per cent and EDF at 88.4 per cent.


Scottish Power's latest performance records show just 22 per cent of customers got their questions answered on their electricity service, but this represents a long-standing high.


The biggest area of improvement for Scottish Power customers is the number of complaints they get at any one time, down from 2,819 per 100,000 people in 2007/08 to 3,036 in 2009/10. However, Scottish Power still has to deal with the largest amount of customers asking the lowest number of questions.


Scottish Power's performance in relation to overall customer satisfaction levels has also struggled to remain in the top three. While its previous performance figures were higher in 2008 and 2009, they have now fallen below the previous low of 92 per cent in March 2012.


Last month, Scottish Power's customer satisfaction benchmark was announced at 97.5 per cent in the Scottish Power Service Performance Index. The lowest rating to date is recorded as a performance index of 62 in November 2007 and this would also be Scottish Power's lowest for the latest performance figures.


Scottish Power said that while it was not at a 'high performance' level, it continued to strive to bring customers the highest customer service standards. But it admitted that for many of its customers, particularly older customers, it had to fight a tough battle, as the company is under the control of the largest operator in Scotland, Scottish Power Generation (SPG).


This would make it very difficult and costly for the Scottish Government to demand improved performance.


It said Scottish and Southern Energy had improved their performance records this year, but that Scottish Power had experienced a'significant improvement' in the delivery of service and the organisation had improved its 'quality and efficiency'.
