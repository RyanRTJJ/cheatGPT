"I've been at the club for about five years now and I know they're a good team; they're a team of the calibre of our squad. Their players would be the first to admit that they've played some fantastic rugby this season.

Scarlets start the season with the visit of RGC 1404 in South Wales on Friday, followed by two home games against European Champions Leinster in Dublin on September 14 and Munster at Parc Eirias on September 28.

The first three rounds feature the Welsh regions away and the regional finals in Belfast and Galway.

Scarlets finished the Heineken Cup second in the table last season, missing out on a place in the Six Nations on the last weekend of the season but finishing ahead of Wales.

The four teams in the Welsh region had a combined total of four wins from five matches and were beaten by France, Ireland, Wales and England.

"There weren't a lot of errors and everyone was up for the contest and I'm confident that the challenge will have given them confidence for the rest of the season.

"It was an incredible atmosphere and I saw the excitement from the spectators on their first outing into Wales.

"It's such a special venue for rugby."
