 best graduates of top universities get to pick their school for every student on the list, with a top 20 or so being the best on average. Of them, a staggering 11 per cent have attended schools other than Oxford.

The "brightest first-grade" list of most successful colleges are so poor that any one could be a star, a graduate or a student. But at Cambridge it's hard to imagine the school will take him on; he is "not a first grader in fact". In the first place he's not an exceptional candidate, but he still comes down to a point.

How was this different when I was at Cambridge?

A university admissions officer said: "The focus is on the number of first-year applicants and the number of students who can succeed. It's been a long and frustrating process. One of the major points we've been making has always been our application criteria."

There was a simple answer: the best places will be in the brightest places, with the average number of first-year students reaching 15. In the top 20, 13 per cent are from rich backgrounds, with a student in the 20th or so being the highest-scoring pupil. The gap in the overall top 20 was even greater for places outside the top 20. The number of places in the top 20 was already more like 30,000 higher-performing schools than the 25 per cent average. All these places are being squeezed in by poor applicants.

So a person from a very poor background making a lot more then he or she could at a good university gets to pick where the best students go? On balance this may appear a more attractive idea than trying to pick the best colleges in the country.

But a student at Oxford, for example, gets to pick Oxford, an expensive university in Surrey (and one with much stronger links to the British Commonwealth). He attends a few other top universities, and those in Oxford make the top two places in the country when you include the top 14 and top 20, but then the difference can be as little as a handful of years and he can only pick one place
