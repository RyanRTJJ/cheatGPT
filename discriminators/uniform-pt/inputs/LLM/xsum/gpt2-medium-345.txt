 been made at about 3.45am.

The inmate was charged with possession of child pornography during his stay at the prison in late October 2015. He has been kept in solitary confinement since his initial detention in August 2014.

An investigation into the case by the UK's Serious Crime Agency revealed that no new images, films or videos of child abuse had been found and no charges had been laid in relation to the case, which remains under active investigation. The UK's National Crime Agency advised against naming the inmate.

A spokeswoman for the Prison Service said that the service would respond. "We are committed to ensuring the safety of prisoners and their families and our officers remain vigilant to safeguard their rights.

"The Prison Service will respond to the police on a case-by-case basis."

Meanwhile, the police remain tight-lipped about what happened to the alleged images and the alleged images are not yet available online.

Police arrested the man, his wife, one or both of their kids and possibly his parents when he was in prison on charges of making and distributing child pornography. The couple had kept an image-sharing website and other electronic devices under lock and key (ESL) which they used to share images between them.

The images were made from the woman, who is also a child, according to her lawyers.

The prison director of staff told BBC Scotland at around the time the picture was taken that a child had died during an episode and it was the responsibility of his staff to report the death to police. However, prison officers went on to arrest the man once his children were at school and he was then transferred to Wrekin, some 50 miles to the south east of Edinburgh.

The husband faces up to 10 years and his daughter is accused of six months, and the mother faces a maximum of seven months. They will have to be assessed to determine whether they should be detained in isolation for
