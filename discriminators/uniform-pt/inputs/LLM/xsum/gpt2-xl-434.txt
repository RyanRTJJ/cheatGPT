 been blamed, but the accident is being attributed to "poor decisions" by the two climbers.

Dr Mark Robinson, the head of rescue operations for the Great Dorset and Isle of Wight, said: "Although the pair had suffered a few mishaps earlier this year, with an avalanche at the very least, they really had only been using a single rope together, possibly with the wrong belay device, which meant they could easily have taken the rope from the wrong edge.

"Had they done so, they would have probably saved themselves from the consequences of a severe avalanche."

He also pointed out that the pair had been on the mountain for about 45 minutes when the incident occurred. The Great Dorset Mountain Rescue team managed to gain access to reach their car at around 2.30am but had to wait until a helicopter could airlift them and their car to their safety.

Robinson said the incident had been a "great disappointment" to the mountain rescue team. "Although it will take a lot more time for staff to work through all the data from the mountain this incident will undoubtedly take a long time to prove as an accident rather than an error."

According to the Independent, the National Park's winter recreation chief, Martin Evans, said last week that the pair had made "a few bad luck decisions" resulting in them failing to return from their first outing on the mountain in February.

"The weather conditions weren't good and they should have had better awareness of where their car was, but they weren't paying it too much mind."

The pair – who go by "Mojitka" and "Michtla" on social media – recently posted about their trip on Instagram.

"So we made it back to the park and we are back on the mountain ready for our winter adventures," they wrote.

"We didn't get a chance to check the weather and plan the route so we had an exciting ride.

"We didn't have to deal with a big avalanche so the ride was pretty safe. It was a pretty big party that we had all made."
