"The ENO has always had a focus on helping other investors, whether in the UK or overseas, and have always done so effectively and effectively without being a nuisance for investors," he said. "It would now be a shame to alienate all those who have had a good relationship with the company over the years."

Mr Brown said that despite his time in the private sector, he is not a politician: he can't "whip out a policy document and deliver it on the front page of the Times." But he does seek to influence debate to help the company and its shareholders.

"Frankly, I was hoping to be able to play in a more decisive, influential and influential role in the company," he said, adding that he has always "wanted to play a greater role in the debate."

He also said that he was leaving in order to focus on the future of UK energy firms. "So, I am doing this so that I can look myself in the eye and declare that, if and when the future comes, I had no other choice but to step down so long as the company I ran was still there, in order to help it grow," he said.

Mr Brown, whose firm, Abertis, is the largest supplier of energy technology in Northern Europe, declined to comment on speculation about his intention to launch his own company. It could be several months before he makes any final decision, it is speculated.
