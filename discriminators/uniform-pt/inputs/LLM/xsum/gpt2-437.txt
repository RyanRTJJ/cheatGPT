In October last year there were 883,000 jobs, or half of total jobs, but the figure was down from 3,000 in July. The number of people on work and pensions had been falling in recent months as a result of a number of policy announcements.

He claimed on Friday: "I can't tell you when I can do more of what will make our economy fairer to women and girls and make every hour of our working
