 have been with Rangers for 25 years."

Preston was the only player to score in three successive games for Rangers, which helped secure their fourth Scottish Premiership title in six years.

The Scots captain won the Golden Boot after scoring in each of Rangers' three wins in the competition.

He also set new Scottish league and Scottish Cup records by scoring an 80th minute winner against Celtic.

Analysis "It is a strange story now. Preston was named captain in 2008 and he had already won the Scottish Cup twice and Scottish League Cup twice before having an incredible first season in 2014. He was never much an accomplished footballer at his school school school, and when Rangers called Preston he told them he had a wonderful future in their world cup squad. The reaction to his winning the award was instantaneous."

But the Scot became an instant sensation when he was substituted on the final day of their final league game in June 2014 by Steven Gerard who replaced him with Jordan Hugill - a 22-year-old Scottish striker.

While Preston enjoyed a breakthrough season, they finished runners-up to the champions Rangers, losing in straight fixtures to Celtic and playing top-of-the-table opponents Kilmarnock and Falkirk.

The team also returned to Scottish football at the end of the season with goals from Andy Robertson, Jamie McLeod, Tommy Dunne and Liam Buckley winning the Golden Boot award with their efforts.

At one point, it looked as though it could be a two-man strike partnership between John Barnes and James Tavernier.

However, the strike partnership went out of the window when they missed the opening two matches of the season - at Rangers and Hearts.

They then got out of the group stage but were also knocked out of the Europa League qualification final in Kiev.

They finally made their return in the Champions League last term and ended one of their worst domestic streaks by beating Juventus in the quarter-final stage.

But defeat to the Biancocelesti had left Rangers on course to miss out on their fifth European crown in five seasons.
