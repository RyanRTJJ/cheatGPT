 now going about solving it.

'No doubt we are more focussed this year than we were last year,' said Hamilton. 'We're happy with how our new Renault power unit has gone since winter testing, we think it's got us faster and we're happy with the car.

'We had good days - we were in third or fourth most of the time - a lot of those were probably our fault. Some were Lewis' fault, our fault because we were not as aggressive in getting position because the car felt so good. We were trying to get on top, but it didn't matter.

'That's something we need to work on as a team, as a driver or as a crew. But as a team, obviously this year we have got everything to do.

'With these guys we obviously have some more pace and we have more resources now than we did back then. So yeah I can't say I am surprised. Obviously it's disappointing in losing the points, this is what comes with experience and experience is being gained by every team. The first world championship is there's a lot of ups and downs. A lot of teams are good in the early rounds and some teams have a lot of down sides in the latter rounds.

'Right now we are second in the constructors. If you add us up with Ferrari then Ferrari has a better car so we are second - it's still up in the air, but there are a lot of options there which are exciting for us.'
