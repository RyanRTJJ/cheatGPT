 but had "been acting aggressively".

He was convicted at Cardiff Crown Court of grievous bodily harm after he attempted to push a police officer using a baton on 4 January 2011.

He said after he was released he was "devastated" and said: "I don't want to live with the consequences of anything I did."

He spent four months in a detention centre before being sent back to Wales to begin a nine-month sentence in December 2014.

Mr Hammond said he would like to see a "tough and sensible" approach put in place to stop incidents like this from happening again and expressed his "sincere apologies" to the victim and to the family of the woman - who has been publicly identified as Sarah Wright before now - for their "inquisition" and "inconspicuous behavior".

He said Mr Hammond believed "justice is at last served" and that a system of criminal justice system needed to take advantage of social media to bring abusers to justice.

A post-mortem examination will then be carried out before sentencing for Mrs Wright and Mr Hunt.

"I would like to recognise the bravery of the police officer who was subjected to violence but the full force of the law, as set out in the Common Sentencing Procedure, applies," he added.

"It is in the interests of justice that everyone should be charged with the same offence and punished with the same penalty."

Tributes to the woman were expected from both the Welsh and English political parties.

Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said: "My thoughts and prayers are with Sarah Wright's family and for all those affected by this terrible incident and the ongoing investigation into them.

"They were two well-respected officers on the front line of helping to tackle crime which is what they were doing."

Conservative cabinet minister Stephen Williams described Mr Hammond as "absolutely world class" and said his work "has changed lives".

Labour defence spokesman Michael Wardle said: "For police officers, it is a real privilege to work at a level of professionalism and professionalism is at the heart of what we do here in Wales.
