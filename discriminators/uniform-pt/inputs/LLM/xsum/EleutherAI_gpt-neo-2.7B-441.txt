 overhaul aimed at lifting the global economy out of its slump.

"If the Korean economy continues to improve, we can anticipate further economic policy measures," said Shin Dong-yeop, chief economist at the state-run Korea Development Institute.

"There won't be any huge changes and the economy would be unaffected."

The new stimulus package, worth 6.5tn Korean won ($5bn Â£3.7bn), is a major step by the government to revive its flagging economy and get it back on track.

Prime Minister Lee Myung-bak has vowed in the past to "never let the Korean economy sink again".

The government approved the latest stimulus package on Friday, following another spending plan which set aside a total sum of 4.8tn Korea won ($3.8bn Â£2.8bn).

The country's trade deficit stood at 5.6tn Korean won ($4.5bn Â£2.9bn) last year, while consumer debt stood at 12.8tn Korea won ($11.2bn Â£7.8bn), the highest in the world.

The cost of the stimulus package was borne by the government and excluded any private investments. ÂThe stimulus package gives a range of tax holidays, loans and tax cuts worth between 2 and 10bn Korean won ($1.5bn Â£1.5bn).

Mr Lee said the government would also reduce government fees as a stimulus package "for the unemployed and un- or underemployed" people.

In other measures, the government will give 100m won ($891,000 Â£675,000) to 400,000 high school students to help them pay for college.

For the second time in two years, the government said it will provide a 2.3tn Korean won ($2.2bn Â£1.5bn) stimulus programme to help companies to stimulate the economy and bring it back from the deepest recession in decades.

The Korea Investment Bank is also taking over a state-run investment company to boost its reserves and cut interest rates to spur investment. ÂThe KEB bank will be known as Korea Investment Bank, reports
