 514-metre runway that is capable of handling jets, and a terminal building with a capacity of 2,500 seats.

Mr O'Dowd said the first stage, known as the main terminal site, would include a runway, accommodation for up to 400 people, an education centre and shops.

"This is just the start, we will be looking to build an airport development campus that will be home to up to 500 people," he said.

The airport site already includes a 300-capacity car park and a number of buildings.

The new airport was first announced in 1989, when the Coalition Government made its first airport announcement and was then branded 'Closed Airport' by the then Opposition leader, Robert Menzies.

The Coalition promised in 2008 to deliver an airport development facility in Bundaberg, but the previous Labor Government abandoned the proposal in April amid community opposition.

The new project was then put on the to-do list of the new Turnbull Government but was quietly shelved until now.

The Minister said the new airport development had a great deal of support, saying only about 15 per cent of the population had criticised the plans.

A number of council members have also welcomed the development, and Mr O'Dowd said he had spoken to mayors about the prospect of an expanded airport.

"We really want to be a part of the solution in this area for the next 20 years," he said.

"For the next 40 years, we are going to have to build an airline network and an airport has to be at the heart of that.

"I think Bundaberg's the perfect spot."

Mr O'Dowd said the airport would help attract an airline to the region.

"The airport will stimulate and enhance business in the region," he said.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten in 2014.

"There are opportunities. One of the big challenges for airlines is that regional centres don't draw them in as quickly and as effectively as capital cities."

Mr O'Dowd said the project was only being considered now because of the Federal Government's increased support of infrastructure projects including transport, energy, and manufacturing.
