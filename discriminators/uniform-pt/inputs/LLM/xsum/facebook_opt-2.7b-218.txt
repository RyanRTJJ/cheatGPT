The Cresswell site will be used by the company's existing Glasgow renal dialysis facility in the Queen's Road West area.

In March last year, Scottish Enterprise confirmed the future of the Cresswell site was being considered.

It is understood more than 30 potential investors showed interest in the site when it was put on the market.

The business case for the sale will include the expected benefits for the Scottish economy, such as new jobs, the business case for the investment will also be submitted to the Scottish Government.

A spokesman for Scottish Enterprise said: "We are looking forward to hearing the results of the business case following its completion and will work closely with Dumfries and Galloway Council and the other relevant bodies in this process.

"The project will create significant employment opportunities across Dumfries and Galloway.

"We have been working closely with Dumfries and Galloway Council throughout the planning process to support their aspirations for the site."

Hemodialysis Scotland is a subsidiary of the Australian multinational company, ASM International. The group's chief executive, Peter Denton, said work was now under way in preparing the site.

He said: "We are delighted to have commenced work on the site of this new dialysis centre and to get started on turning it over to the team from Glasgow who are already in place."

Mr Denton added: "We will continue our focus on growth through investment in our existing businesses and a targeted exploration of expansion opportunities across our range of products."

Dumfries and Galloway Labour MSP Iain Brown MSP said: "Growth is crucial to our economy.

"I believe that this project will bring jobs to many, as well as delivering a much needed facility for dialysate production. The economic benefits will be considerable."

Mr Brown said Dumfries is a "great area" for business and is "highly attractive" for entrepreneurs.
