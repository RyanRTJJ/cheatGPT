 interference in these two networks. It is thought that the satellites were used to provide intelligence for their targets. As the communications were disrupted, data and information were transferred to other areas of space, such as deep space.

"This is just the beginning" of our knowledge of the cosmos, says Dr. Paul, who has conducted research involving this and other cosmic microwave signals for 40 years. He notes that the existence of a space-based network of communication signals is an intriguing possibility.

Although not yet proven, it is interesting that the research found a way to transmit these signals using quantum computers without interference.

The Micius satellite was built by Micius, the German company that built the satellites, in 2007 to provide a satellite communications system with the ability to communicate over the Earth. Micius, based in Kiel, Belgium, manufactures satellites on a rotating basis, using a combination of an optical engine and the same optical fibre that a mobile phone would normally use. The company's founder, Professor Peter Bruegel, believes the current network provides some of the most advanced quantum computing technology in Europe, with the capability to provide a fully-electronic system capable of handling more than five terabits per second.

"Because of the sheer scale of how far the microwave frequency spectrum can be measured from the ground, it was possible for satellite signals to reach a high-energy level or be able to go much further than the original microwave frequency," Dr. Bruegel says.

This quantum computing technology has only just been demonstrated, but it could lead to fundamental advances in the study of the universe's structure and the possible existence of life, adds Dr. Mark Miller, Professor of Physics, Department of Physics, University College London. "The fact that we are building these satellites in a very small area will hopefully have the potential to greatly reduce the amount of effort involved in the development of the most expensive and expensive communications system in the history of mathematics."
