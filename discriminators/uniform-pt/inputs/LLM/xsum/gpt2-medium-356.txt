The defendants are alleged to have colluded to give money, goods and services to Mr Bannister.

The criminal case will be heard on Wednesday.

One of the men, David Bannister, 46, from London, who also goes by the name of Jeremy Walker, 23, from Derbyshire, from an address in Bury, denies colluding with the individuals alleged to be Mr Taylor and Mr Bannister.

And one of the men, John Houde, 41, who goes by the name of Christopher Taylor, 46, from Cardiff, denies two counts of conspiracy.

A fifth accuser, James Taylor, 29, from Southampton, from an address in Bury, denies two counts of conspiracy.

On 13 July 2009, Mr Taylor appeared at Southwark Crown Court charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit extortion and the four counts of conspiracy (two counts of perverting the course of justice, two counts of conspiracy to mislead and two counts of false imprisonment). He was supported by six supporters, including Mr Hudson and Mr Walker. Mr Hudson was also arrested yesterday (Monday), accused of attempting to bribe Mr Taylor through Mr Hudson, who also goes by the name Jeremy, to give Mr Taylor information when he was still on bail.

Detective Constable Simon Farrar, from police in Manchester, said: "This case has been long in the making, and we have tried for years to bring to justice those responsible who committed this crime. It is a deeply concerning case and we expect all the charges to be withdrawn."
