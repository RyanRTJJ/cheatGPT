"If we don't help people, there'll be no more people coming to our streets," said David Mudd, co-ordinator of Shelter House. "We owe this man, who was just trying to stay safe, so much for all the work that he's doing."

But not all shelter owners were happy to see The Spectator story hit the headlines.

"These sort of things create quite a buzz," said Matt Cresswell, co-owner of Good Shepherd Community Ministries. "But this just highlights a few very frustrating realities that people do face when they're homeless. It's a very hard time."

Cresswell said it's difficult to imagine keeping the streets safe from violent gangs and drug peddlers without the help of social workers, police and the Salvation Army and other local agencies. "People in the shelters don't just live by themselves out in the cold. People often stay with friends who are homeless."

Cresswell pointed out how The Spectator has presented the shelter stories as if they are the norm â€“ the homeless on the street are "bad people" or "lazy people" who aren't being helpful.

"I've had shelter owners say to me, 'I know these families but there have never been homeless people running up to the doors of my shelter and asking to come in and we could help.' This is because there are some homeless who are trying and some who aren't. At the very least people shouldn't be going into people's homes and asking for money. I think that's just being a bad person.'"

At the local level, Cresswell said "the problem often gets worse when these shelters are closing."

"For those struggling to find housing in the city that means having to commute a distance and getting stuck in traffic. It can be hard to fit in work commitments with the commuting."

When it comes to the homeless, he said "the solution is not simply for (these men) to get help. A shelter house or some other service may be another option."

What are shelter houses?

He believes there are at least one or two shelter houses open to homeless men in every community
