 threat of raising council tax they face a cost increase of Â£13.5m.

Tory councillor Robert Moore wants them to "use that money to develop a centre of excellence for research and development into renewable energy, for water saving and for the transport sector".

He also wants them to "take the opportunity to provide the best environment for children to be exposed to free sport and for families to enjoy summer activities through the city centre with green spaces".

Councillor Andrew Harkness wants "forbearance" from council tax for investment in free sports area, and the council might "let people ride cycle bikes in the park and on the beach".

The council is hoping to generate new revenue through its council tax rises in two phases, through a cut in council tax for residents and families, or with a property tax increase linked to local planning by the council.

However the council did not confirm its position on whether or not it would take property increases in step for raising council tax.

Tory city centre council's general manager Tony Clark told the Today programme: "We are looking at all options on tax rise. There is an abundance of property tax proposals, that are out there. With the existing rate, I am sure a strong voice from the wider community will be raised.

"The current planning committee will hold a second public hearing very soon about property tax proposals. We would have lots of feedback on our proposals and we could even have some other people raise their own proposals if they want to."

Coun Moore told Today: "You don't have to tax the rich to help those who have to pay more. The government's attitude can lead to people feeling poorer. You don't have to take more, you just have to look after your poor neighbour."

Council Tax on 1 February will be the biggest increase since 2009/10, and could threaten the revenue provided by property developments.

The council says it has more than 3,000 properties, many of which are worth less
