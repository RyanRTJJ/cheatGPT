The murder trial heard that at a pre-trial hearing at Mold Crown Court on Tuesday, October 4 of this year, detectives arrested a man over the death of Sion Davies, at Munkley's home address in Bicester.

After arresting 25 year old Scott Munkley, Mold's leading cold case detective, officers turned their attention to Scott Munkley's wife.

Mr Justice Griffith Williams continued the case against Scott Munkley by opening two further hearings on Tuesday 10th November, to continue the trial of 29 year old Anthony Munkley on separate charges of causing the death of Anthony Munkley.

According to the court today, in the weeks before he was killed, Sion Davies was allegedly involved in money laundering and drugs trading that could potentially fall within the scope of a criminal complaint to the Police and Crime Commissioner against him for the illegal drug trade.

An independent review ordered by Cllr Neil Cocker was set up to look into Sion Davies's death.

Today a number of witnesses were called to give evidence at the first hearing of Scott Munkley's murder trial.

Sion Davies' father David Davies told the court yesterday that on August 19 1999 he met a man in the Mold shopping centre.

Mr Davies said: "Scott Munkley has never paid any kind of rent. It came up as a conversation and we had a meal around that time.

"This is not something I ever questioned. I got to know him from the police.

"He had been to court to be found not guilty by reason of insanity."
