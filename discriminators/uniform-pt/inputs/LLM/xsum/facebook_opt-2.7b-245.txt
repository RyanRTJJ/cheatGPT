, but that was unlikely to deter those responsible. In 2014, at least six prominent members of Mr Chavez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) were killed in assassinations, kidnappings and attacks on political events. The opposition blames the government.

In a country with an estimated 80m voters, election day will be a hugely important moment in the country's history. As usual, turnout will remain low. Last year, only 11.9% of the electorate cast ballots.

In 2014, the opposition won a landslide victory, but the electoral commission quickly annulled the results. Many thought opposition leader Henrique Capriles's claim on his victory would galvanise voters, but they remained apathetic, preferring to stay at home. Those who did vote chose the opposition candidate, but the election became a mere formality; neither candidate had supporters in the crowd. When Mr Capriles returned home with his wife in a stolen car, it was clear that no election was possible this year.

In the two months before the election, the government tried to mobilise voters, but failed. In May, Mr Maduro went on a four-day bus tour, but he was booed by marchers, and his image was plastered on billboards in the opposition area of Caracas, where he was forced to abandon his bus and run for safety.

A year later, Venezuela is a basket case, and there is no immediate prospect of anything improving. The opposition is desperate for elections to take place, but the government will boycott the poll unless a legal demand for snap polls is accepted. It is all a futile exercise, given that Mr Maduro won't let the opposition have a vote. The opposition has lost hope. They will not participate, and they won't take part in a charade. But they are still waiting.

The opposition has no intention of giving up, nor does it mean to lose. But even after two decades of this charade, voters remain ambivalent. A recent poll showed that 56% of Venezuelan citizens believe that democracy in Venezuela has failed, but 45% believe it still
