, with a 1-0 loss to Netherlands in the semi finals to take gold in Sochi last month.

Canada's roster is headlined by two-time world champion Magnus Carlsen, reigning world champion Magnus Carlsen and 2012 world champion Fabiano Caruana.

This is the 10th edition of the tournament and is the first for the tournament in its eight iteration over the past 14 years. The 10th edition of the Baku event brings into line the tournament from 2005-2006, with eight semi-finals and a draw and an opening game.

The Canadian squad is the first to have played twice in a season of professional men's chess (2015, 2017 & 2023), their fourth event in a five year cycle starting in 2006. This year, seven of the 10 matches featured World Chess champions playing for teams from the top 15 countries of the world: Russia, England, Norway, the U.S. and Brazil (Canada's players came in at 11th, 12th and 11nd, respectively on the all-time list). On Sunday at The International, they met at a tournament hosted by Tata in India, taking down the defending World Masters champion Hikaru Nakamura in the final game to take the title

Canada's 2017 campaign is the 10th season under CEO Dave Fridmann's leadership and included wins over England, Denmark, Sweden and Austria. It also featured an overall ranking above the global average of 1,500 for the first time in Canadian history. The women finished top four in three titles â€“ the first time they've played in both singles and tournaments in the same year. This gave an indication of which players made the most impact.

Rounding out Friday, Canada's men's team beat Poland 7-7 with Magnus Carlsen as their opener, and won 6-2 against Japan 7-6 to become only the second Canadian team to win its first World Championship. The U.S.'s match against Russia was drawn and only Canada finished with a World title as a result.
