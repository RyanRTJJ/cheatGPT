 say its shape is ideal for this purpose, since it is only 10 cm wide and 11 cm deep.

The project began in 2009 with the help from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley).

The project has successfully funded further experiments with the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the Keweenaw National Security Council Satellite Launchers.

"Our project will allow to measure the amount of light that goes onto the Hubble telescope, to the surface, and back to the telescope," said James Moore, the project manager.

In addition, the researchers tested their experiment using the Hubble Space Telescope at the LAPO-2 and MSSS-C. They were surprised the surface of the bright star did not drop as well as expected from the Keweenaw star. This suggests it was going into it with its surface as it travelled through the air.

The LAPO-2 spacecraft is a large, low-cost space telescope that orbits far out to the Earth in the constellation of Orion.

When asked, an Orbital ATK spokesman said the agency already has more money to develop its next payload: its R&D vehicle to send back information from the Moon that will allow researchers to better understand the Universe from below the clouds in the Milky Way.

NASA previously launched about 700 payloads in this decade, including the SES-09 spacecraft, in 2011, the Gemini 11 spacecraft, the CRS-12 mission to measure exoplanet formation and the Hubble Space Telescope, with R2 in 2013.

The Hubble Space Telescope will be used by NASA so it could be viewed in unprecedented detail

The discovery of the dark regions of the Milky Way could explain how the universe first formed.

The Hubble telescope is expected to offer clues about the origin, the development and the life of other exoplanets around the galaxy, the researchers say.

The LAPO-2 is scheduled to begin flying by end of April.
