 noted that there was no sign of an imminent imminent attack.

"The attack is consistent with the daily attacks by Syrian forces on civilians in Idlib province for several months," it said. However, it said that Syrian forces also carried out attacks against a school on Tuesday morning.

Islamic State (also by name of ISIS, also known as ISIL, or both ISIL and ISIL, for short) has been waging a four-front war in Syria for nearly four years. Since taking power in Syria in 2014 and Syria last year, it has taken over several hundred major cities and an additional 5 million foreign fighters. Last month, rebels on the ground in Deir Ezzor killed 10 children and sickened dozens.

In May, Islamic State began its offensive across western Syria. It carried its first major offensive in almost three months, the second one in May, after it was overrun earlier this year by the militia.

In August, it captured swathes of southern Syria. The group said it hoped to establish an Islamic State headquarters in northern and western Syria.

In a statement, the Syrian regime backed Islamic State's efforts to establish a "high security" area, a plan that has received international condemnation. The Syrian government's military spokesman has dismissed the regime's call to create a "caliphate."
