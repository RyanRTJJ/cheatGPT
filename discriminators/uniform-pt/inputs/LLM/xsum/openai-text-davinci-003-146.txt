 Dhabi

Hamilton only needs to finish in the top three at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday to be crowned world champion, but he is determined to end the season on a high.

The Briton, who already has 16 race wins this season, has been almost unstoppable in the second half of the year, winning the last four races.

He is convinced he can add another victory and said: “I want to end this season on a high note and I’m determined to go out there and win the race.

“I know I have a great car underneath me and the team has done an incredible job all year, so I want to make sure that we can finish in the best possible way.”
