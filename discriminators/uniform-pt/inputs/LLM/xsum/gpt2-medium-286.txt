The report from the Transport Professions Research Centre, London, published in 2003, notes a similar trend involving private hire vehicles operating in conjunction with public transport.

See information in TfL's blog post below on the increasing costs of private passenger van journey from 2003 onwards.

The main findings are:

"A significant increase in travel costs for private hire vehicles on public transport (1-14%)".

"Private hire vehicle ownership is declining (6%)".

The costs of private travel are increasing due to:

The increasing number of private hired vehicles on public transport (up 15%)

The increasing number of private hire vehicles not traveling on public transport (up 30%)

A decrease in the size of the private hire fleet over time

A doubling of the number of journeys made by private hire vehicles to more than 250 passengers per journey

The costs of private transport are often high because of cost of parking (up 2%) and accommodation and living expenses (from 2.5%) due to the larger total number of journeys made by private hire vehicles in comparison to public transport.

This report contains some detailed information on changes (over a ten year period) in the number of private hire vehicles, including an analysis of the change in the percentage of private hire vehicles using public transport in 2014.
