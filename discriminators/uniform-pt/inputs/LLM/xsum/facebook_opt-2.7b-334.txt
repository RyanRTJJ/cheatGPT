 Parker and Nolan were both homeless and slept rough together at a hostel for a time.

Prosecutor Stephen Borthwick said Nolan started to have an affair with a different woman last autumn but their relationship had “fizzled out” by December.

It’s understood that Nolan and Parker had a disagreement over the affair and on 22 December Nolan drove home drunk after their argument and was seen by a neighbour driving the car on the wrong side of the road and crashing into another car.

He was jailed for 10 years on Tuesday after the jury heard that Nolan was suffering from multiple personality disorder, a rare condition in which more than one soul has the power to act in unison. Nolan admitted that he was schizophrenic and that he believed he was a fictional character called Kratos, the Greek warrior in the “God of War” video game.

The trial was told that Nolan had suffered two previous “breaks”. The first in October 2017 saw him released on bail with a condition that he not take heroin but also that he did not take any controlled substances, meaning that he was only taking prescribed medication for mental conditions. He broke this curfew on 10 December, spending Christmas Day alone.

The trial heard that he tried to commit suicide by jumping out of a window but was found at the bottom of a 15ft cliff in Southport. He was taken to hospital for treatment.

Nolan was arrested the next day after an altercation with a police officer.
