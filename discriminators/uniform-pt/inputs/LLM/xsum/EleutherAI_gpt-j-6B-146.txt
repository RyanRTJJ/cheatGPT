 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Lewis Hamilton's career began in England, winning his first title in 2010 as a 22-year-old at the season-ending British Grand Prix.

It has always been his greatest triumph of all the times in which Hamilton has won.

It was an emotion-charged evening at Abu Dhabi as he won by 43 seconds - for the last time in a British Grand Prix - to reclaim the championship lead from Rosberg after two-and-a-half years.

If the race was to mark the formal end of Hamilton's career at the top, there was always the possibility that Rosberg could follow him.

They now have the same number of career starts, more than 100 grands prix wins and more than half a century of experience between them.

In the past four seasons, Hamilton has won a record seven British Grand Prix titles and is now the only world champion of the current generation still in the sport.

But Rosberg took a brave line into the race and will hope that that he could become the first German to win a title since Michael Schumacher did in 1995.

So what was it like to drive one more time round the same track in which we first met?

Inevitably, there are many memories, including perhaps the best one - beating Sebastian Vettel in the previous race to retain the title at Silverstone.

I knew I would be racing with Nico and that I still was not comfortable in our relationship.

At some point you have to accept a certain thing - it is all over, it is a final act of one of your roles in your life, and that in itself is quite a bittersweet kind of feeling.

So you need to deal
