On top of the heavy water, there were also more than 50 tons of dust and oil and hundreds of fires which have been killing thousands of forest-related trees.

At the same time, the company was also being investigated for the alleged corruption inside its Brazilian operation.

In October, it was revealed that the company was implicated in a case of bribery and kickbacks and the Brazilian judicial system was investigating several government ministers, including President Dilma Rousseff.

The scandal caused Ms Rousseff's impeachment in Brazil within a short few weeks. Shortly before the impeachment was announced, on January 7th President Dilma Rousseff flew to Argentina, in order to reassure the country's biggest companies that they would not be the victims of the Brazilian investigation.

It appears as though the companies were not too amused.

On the 15th of January, a day after the impeachment announcement, OAS, the European Federation of Portuguese Associations, called on the Brazilian government to "ensure that companies have the tools and the certainty to operate at a level where they can meet compliance standards in the most effective way possible".

One of the biggest companies in Brazil, Medef, was even more direct in its statement regarding the Brazilian government's investigation, stating that they wanted to "put Brazil, its government and its citizens first, including businesses".

This sentiment was echoed by numerous Brazilian businesses which said that they wanted a "healthy economy as soon as possible".

Brazilian businessmen have publicly opposed the company's activities in the past, stating that the company is a "threat" to investment and tourism in the country and it has been investigated for its political reasons.

For example, last year in 2016, Medef, was fined $2.1 million after it was found that the company had illegally used corporate funds to support a group of politicians.

And in 2011, Medef was forced to shut down its operations there for four years following a corruption investigation.
