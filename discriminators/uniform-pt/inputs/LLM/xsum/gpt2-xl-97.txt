When confronted by local police officers with video evidence, Gizewski told them that Jones was a "well-known author and speaker" or something. He then offered to testify under oath that his description was accurate.

"I'm not crazy," he said. "I'm not mentally ill. I've had a history of depression."

There's so much of this out there, and it's difficult to see how it could have survived the attention.

But the thing that makes the Post's version of events
