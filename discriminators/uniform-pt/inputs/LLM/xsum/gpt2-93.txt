 the journey, and urges the government to put it after three new "longest-planned journeys" in three years, to the tune of about 1.9 million journeys.

The Rail Fair campaign says that more than 10,000 journeys are now being planned for new stations. It would also call on ministers to make their own trains to replace these routes.

The campaign urges the government to pay for five rail stations in new South London stations, which the rail secretary John Brokenshire said must happen within 30 years.

It says there are more than 10,000 new passengers passing through London each day, with the only service coming from South London due to be electrified by 2020.

The Rail Fair's Director for Communications, Tony Phillips, said: "This campaign is a strong case that the cost of a single car travelling to and from London is unsustainable. The rail companies must now come up with new and cheaper methods of saving money on journeys which benefit local communities.

"But in my view, the money cannot buy a better service. The rail companies have no plans or resources to meet their commitments without risking disruption to our public transport system."

The government said it does not comment on ongoing issues with plans or other issues relating to the rail industry.

The Government said it plans to make further improvements to the rail infrastructure as part of its £3billion budget for the next 10 years. The new routes from Heathrow, A24 to the capital's Milton Keynes, are expected to provide some 3,000 rail journeys per day to around 150 Londoners this weekend alone.

Rail Fair general secretary Nick Robinson said: "The rail industry is taking the railways to new heights by investing £200bn a year in rail infrastructure.

"However, given the economic decline in our country's transport costs, we have to find ways of keeping up with the increase in passenger demand through new routes."
