 described Ferrari's success as "incredible" but insisted they owed their success to managing director Sergio Marchionne. "Not many can say their career means something to them and not many can say that Ferrari has done it in 15 years," Massa said. "You can't complain when your team is so fast from so many cars, not in the same way as winning the world championship." But he added: "At 25 years old, it's time to step back... I can't have two championships under my belt yet and I can't have three under my belt." He described Ferrari's success as "incredible" but insisted they owed their success to managing director Sergio Marchionne. "Not many can say their career means something to them and not many can say that Ferrari has done it in 15 years," Massa said.

"Now, it must have been difficult for [general manager] Maurizio Arrivabene, but to be honest, I consider him an idol."

On Ferrari's decision to replace Felipe Massa's contract with Kimi Raikkonen - whose $300,000-a-week deal was due to be extended to another five years - Massa added: "I'm happy for him, he's really strong in terms of form and consistency. Kimi is a fighter and I can see that he can win more races than a lot of other drivers." But Massa's retirement confirmed rumours that Ferrari's front-running dominance in 2016 was over.

Massa won 16 races including 10 grands prix and scored the world championship's second, best finish and most victories. On Mercedes junior-spec team Toro Rosso his only mistake was to place four positions too low in sixth position on his debut in October. But on a team with a strong balance of power, the Finn made it clear he never wanted to leave for an F1 partner under an offer that was more manageable.

"I don't mind leaving for others but no one from McLaren, Ferrari or anyone else wants to pay me less than $40m. I don't know what happens at some point in the future. You have to pay what one needs but at some point I'd like to think people will be happy."
