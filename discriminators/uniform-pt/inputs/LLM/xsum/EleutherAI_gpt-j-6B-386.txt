 Heritage grant proposal to MPs next Monday to support his cause.

He was asked on BBC Breakfast if he would swap with the Welsh anthem, Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau which means Country, Yes. Country, Yes!, if there were to be a vote in Parliament and it was a free vote.

He responded that it might be good but he thinks it would be better to have a new country song with some new words that celebrate the diversity of the UK rather than a song that celebrates the history of the monarchy.





Toby added “I think that is what would be more appropriate.





‘Tiny islands, all just part of one big happy family.’”

We think this is a good plan.

Let us know your thoughts:





I watched the opening ceremony and was reminded of the film “The Queen”.

I used to be a fan of the old Empire and it was a shame to see it go with all the Commonwealth countries pulling out

I hope the Brexit thing gets sorted soon.

The Queen has spoken of her great disappointment at the Brexit vote so I think she should hold off for now unless she wants to make a bit of a song and dance.

Veto, I also agree with you. As a young man I loved The Empire. There is no doubt that what we are seeing today must be put down to the fact that the Empire had gone before. It is sad.

Veto V, you are spot on. I remember the old Empire and that is why I had such a great passion for it. I think that most of the Commonwealth countries had been great ambassadors of the British Empire and I hope that they can be reinstated.

Wakey Wokey, I agree with Veto V. I like everything about that film and have it on video. The Queen was an outstanding piece of work and that’s why I think it is so hard to watch a film like this now. Why do you think she wants to stay on?

Hugh,

‘The Queen’ makes the point that the Empire has gone,
