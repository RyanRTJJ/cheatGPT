There are concerns over the conditions where they will be processed after an Italian charity ship, Sea-Watch 3, was refused access to a group of migrants it had picked up on Lesbos last week.

It was refused an anchor in the port of Mytilene because it was a "coaling point" for a migrant rescue ship that was attempting to take the migrants to a Greek island.

The German NGO, Sea-Watch, said they had received the instruction to leave from the Greek immigration ministry, but the Dutch police said the order was not the only reason the boat was denied permission to be in port.

The charity has so far refused to heed the order of the German interior minister to return the ship to the Turkish coast and has insisted it stay in the area.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Sea-Watch spokesman said: "The government of the Netherlands was not informed of the directive to the vessel by the Greek government."

The spokesman claimed the Greek naval commander said it would have been possible for the Sea-Watch 3 to stop its scheduled departure after their crew said they planned to help the migrants escape Turkish patrol boats.

The German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who flew to Turkey on Monday for talks to tackle the migrant crisis, reportedly said earlier this month he would only allow the Sea-Watch 3 to dock with permission from the coast guard of the country from which the migrants left.

Proactiva said the vessel would meet up with the German authorities soon in the Greek city of
