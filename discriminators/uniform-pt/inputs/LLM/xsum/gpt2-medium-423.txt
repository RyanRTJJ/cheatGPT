 between a billion and one trillion pounds every week.

An energy spokesman for FCA said: "We're delighted to move faster than expected, taking a decisive step to reduce demand for fuel at peak times and allowing fuel to be saved for the foreseeable future."


Liz Higgs, director of policy at FCA's UK unit, said: "There's a lot less fuel-saving than we hoped and the result is that we're losing between 1 and 600 million kilowatthours (kWh) of electricity supply. We have to ensure that we keep up in the future.

"If not we'll have to do more to prevent peak times when demand is higher overall."

• The Independent regrets the error in a story on Sunday 27 April about FCA's claims that the Scottish Parliament needed to approve a second independence referendum as it could trigger national legislation. An earlier version suggested the referendum must last no longer than five years. The error was removed from the story as a result of further investigation into the matter. The error should not have affected the ability to publish stories and stories in all parts of the country.
