 time rules.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was due to publish an employment guidance document on working time this month following its consultation.

The consultation, however, has been delayed while Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith reconsiders it, a spokesman said.

"We recognise that some workers still have a range of different roles to do, and the need to manage health and safety issues, and this is an area where the department's recent advisory to businesses has focused," a spokesman said. "However, it is important to note that, under EU law, care workers may also still be entitled to annual leave."

It comes after a string of deaths of care workers in the UK are believed to be linked to a shortage of oxygen and oxygen masks.

The deaths have led to fresh calls on politicians for more support for workers and a crackdown on bad bosses and poor safety practices.

Firms employing care workers include Asda, Tesco, Debenhams, Tesco Mobile, Dixons Carphone and Carphone Warehouse.

The consultation will seek input from the industry on the latest guidance from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC).

The changes in the legislation were introduced last year as part of a wider package of changes to EU workplace law, but this guidance was only published recently ahead of a final bill getting Parliament's approval.

The TUC said concerns were being raised about the wording in the consultation, although it added that it also welcomed the recent legislation.

"We welcome the fact that the new legislation addresses the issues of oxygen masks and access to oxygen at work, recognising the important roles that care workers play," said Tony Burke, the TUC's general secretary.

"With the safety of our workers on the agenda, we urge those employers who have not yet adopted this measure to do so now and we look forward to supporting organisations that wish to do so with the necessary guidance and support."

The consultation seeks input from organisations across the sectors involved in the care and nursing sector, as well as voluntary organisations, local authorities and NHS trusts.

It also seeks input from the public and private partners that provide the care and care workers
