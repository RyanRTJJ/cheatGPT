 overall representation. Its largest council candidates were not elected earlier in 2015, but the party is the official opposition in five constituencies - and at a time of rising nationalist nationalism in parts of central and south-west London.

It is understood most of the councils, including Bexleyheath and Waltham Forest, which came out as UKIP is gaining ground among local people.

The Liberal Democrats have been out of operation in a group of five constituencies - Chelmsford, Chipping Barnet, Tower Hamlets, Richmond Park and Waltham Forest.

Bexleyheath has held out but its Conservative candidate, Conservative councillor John Gittings, is still running as an independent. Its UKIP candidate, Councillor Peter Stott, was elected in the borough in 2014.

Southend's UKIP chairman, John Wilson, said Ukip had shown a "huge amount of resilience" but admitted the election result "has shaken us".

"It is a very serious blow for our party to have all our candidates being beaten," he said.

"It wasn't until last week that we started to work with the candidates, in consultation with all the local authorities. We are working closely with the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and the Green Party to make sure our campaigns move forward, and we continue to believe that all three major parties are a good thing."

As well as UKIP, another party, Respect, won four council seats but lost nine in a string of elections between the start of parliament this year and May 12.

The two parties said they had set up alternative parties to avoid being branded right-wing or xenophobic.

The two left-leaning parties were also affected by several by-elections in recent months. Labour lost 15 in nine by-elections, while the Liberal Democrats took four in a row.

The Liberal Democrats, although winning a second majority, faced a tough fight on May 12.

Labour's vote across the country has declined by 7.1% in the wake of the election, according to official figures.
