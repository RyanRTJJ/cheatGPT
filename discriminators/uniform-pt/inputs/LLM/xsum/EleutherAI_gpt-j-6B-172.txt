ised things with the wickets of Jack Leach (4) and Chris Wright (8) in the space of three overs.

It meant the Sharks were left with the all-too-familiar task of winning eight one-day games in 13 days - or in other words, trying to win matches that didn't matter in the context of the final result even if they did.

Worcestershire won all five of those - their last defeat was to Somerset at Taunton last Saturday - but the margin between the two sides in all five games was a hefty 45 runs.

Worcestershire had two other advantages against their county's old foes: a bonus point for the win and a huge home advantage with a packed Moseley crowd.

And the Sharks' new-ball pairing of Michael Klinger and Jack Leach, who shared eight wickets between them, made the difference.

It started in the third over as Klinger (three-for) and Leach (four-for) both took a wicket in consecutive balls to leave Worcestershire 22-4.

But the Sharks, fielding third as the home side went in, did not score in their reply. Klinger (45 from 25 balls with six fours) bowled in an extended eighth over taking 1-6, but it took some neat touches from both Clarke and Cox to get to the close on 98-4.

Clarke began the chase by hitting two fours off the third ball of the ninth over, but then was dismissed without scoring. It was a different story for Worcestershire's openers Jack Leach (21) and Ross Whiteley (10) who scored 40 and a stand of 58 to win with more than five overs to spare.

Leach won the toss for Worcestershire and sent Somerset into bat.

The start was not promising for the visitors as Sam Robson (2-34) and Joe Clarke (2-16) bowled well to dismiss Matthew Wood (10) and Tom Smith (3) in four overs.

Worcestershire's openers showed their form by going to the close on 56-2 in the fourth over.
