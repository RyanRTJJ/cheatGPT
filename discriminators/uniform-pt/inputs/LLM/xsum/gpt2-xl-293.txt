 he was in Athens illegally and have never registered him in their database. When he was found by a fisherman off Kos the following year, his mother made a desperate plea to Greek police to let him in. The Greek authorities granted her request when he turned 18. Two days into the flight to Greece, the boy suffered a seizure and had to be separated from his family.

As The Independent reports, a Greek immigration official, who spoke anonymously, said: "There was no information that he had gone abroad."

Needham, who now lives on the Greek island of St Athanasios in the Aegean Sea, spoke about his ordeal to the BBC in 2003 while he was serving prison time.

"This was the first time I was ever interviewed by an actual policeman," he told the station, "So I just told them what I'd done, like that, and they never took any notice. I just went right back to prison the same way. This is the life I have now – prison."

As the New Statesman reports, the boy's parents travelled to Greece to request him being re-admitted into Greek society. According to NewStatesman, the Greek authorities ignored their request.

Needham could face charges for entering Greece illegally — which could bring him six years in jail — and his parents could face charges as well, if their son is proven to have been illegally in the country.

Speaking for the family in 2003, Needham's mother told the BBC that her son had been under "intense pressure" since his arrest.

She said: "He had been in prison, so he was very depressed. He'd been through what he went through in prison."

Greece is home to over 70,000 illegal immigrants.
