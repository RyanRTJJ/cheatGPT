 consider whether their posts were "in the public interest".

A Twitter spokesman has since acknowledged that in one incident several Twitter accounts were blocked and one of the employees received a stern warning about his comments. He refused to elaborate on what type of comment was banned.

The department has now lifted the restriction in question, stating:

This evening we have removed the social media restriction to our website. This has allowed our digital data engineers now to make new announcements to the public directly, and in ways which are not censored via social media.

The Register further reports that Twitter also lifted their previous social media ban on staff, and that the department had previously blocked the account of a union official who spoke out over his concerns with an allegedly flawed job advert. ®

Bootnote

The Register also publishes, with its Twitter archive, the tweets in question. I cannot find a single example of this being mentioned elsewhere, either in the mainstream media or on social media.

As I write this, there are no reports that this restriction has been reinstated. The BBC reported, however, to the effect that Twitter are to introduce new guidelines following some bad experiences and the subsequent cancellation of accounts. A spokesperson from Twitter told The Reg yesterday:

Twitter is pleased to have been able to work with the Department of Transport, and with its support, to implement a robust social media policy for the UK.

As of last October (when the current ban was introduced), Twitter do not appear to have allowed the public access to the department's twitter page. It is unclear whether this changed as a result of this week's ban.

The whole point of Twitter is to ensure that the politicians you’re not inclined to pay attention to can’t shout down your political views via their use of their favourite media platform. It’s been a great tool to this end.
This is another example of a tool that can actually work against an organisation that seems to have a political agenda. Perhaps this is a case of using social media to the advantage of a media outlet?
