 Lallana and Ross McCormack got their goals for Roberto Martinez's team, while James Troisi and James Forrest were both denied by Gordon Gordon.

While the goals may have piled up for Martinez's side, it was the Scots who were the brighter.

A corner midway through the first half from the left fell to Troisi who lashed into the bottom left corner.

As the Scots attempted to get themselves back on level terms, Forrest got his name on the score sheet in fine style. After some deft footwork, the winger sent a low drive past the oncoming Gordon to give his side the lead.

There was a flurry of action in the first ten minutes of the second half, with a number of chances falling to Stewart Downing, with the winger just failing to get the better of Gordon.

Downing was also denied, but this time in a rather unique manner by Gordon Gordon, who took up a high cross with his feet and a diving header.

With the score at two, the score line remained at two - and with just ten minutes of play remaining, McCormack popped up to head over Gordon Gordon.

The game began to open up as the Scots pushed further on to try and pull the game back. Stewart Downing was forced to go off as a precaution with just a quarter of an hour to play, with Downing's injury a left calf strain.

With the game on the brink of going into extra-time, Gordon Gordon managed to turn the ball back into the net after being tipped over by the advancing Allan McGregor.

The game ended in an embarrassing defeat for Gordon Strachan's men as they lost 3-1 to Colombia in a friendly match in Buenos Aires on Friday.
