 could not be supported under the existing system.

The change, under the Government's plan, would make patients better off by moving people to privately run hospitals instead, potentially allowing them to be seen by staff at the same time as the existing service. There have already been suggestions the NHS could go out of business if the change was not made.

Sajjan Gauteng, the Care Quality Director at Children's Hospital England, said: "We are horrified by the fact that many NHS staff and patients have been subjected to appalling conditions at Children's and would not be able to provide for their loved ones at their children's hospitals.

"We encourage NHS England to follow through by moving this critical change as soon as possible."
