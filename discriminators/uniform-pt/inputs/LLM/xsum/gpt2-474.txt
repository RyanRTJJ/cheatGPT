. A day later she was found on her bed with her head missing and two toes missing.

The BBC's David Williams on 30 January reported a story of "a cat called R.I.P B" from the Royal Free, and it followed her and her sister, who had been found in an ice cave in the mountains last week.

Their sister, Daisy, told the BBC that B was wearing just her dress shoes, was wearing white shoes with white stripes and blue and white boots.

"She's still unconscious," Daisy told the BBC. She said that her sister had thrown her out after seeing her missing sister. "She was just running around when the dogs came and grabbed her and took her away for a bit," she added.

The Guardian has reported that animal charities say they have reported animal suffering in areas with an outbreak of poachers. The charity, Wildlife Relief, is working with the UK National Animal Control Authority, a team that runs the UK government's own poachers-containment centre in Kent.

A group of local animal welfare campaigners told The Guardian they were sceptical that they could be held accountable with such dire consequences. "These things happened in isolated areas without the concern and a focus," said Chris Frawley, the group's director of animal protection. "It is the whole of society that was behind this case."

Cafferkey's death has already added to the fury of a long-standing controversy over the deaths of black African wildlife: her murder following the attack of a black bear was ruled an animal cruelty case.

The Royal Free Hospital in London, which is currently investigating a case of fatal rhino poaching at two breeding grounds, has confirmed that more than 400 animals were killed at a time in 2010. There have been 10 additional reports of injuries to the animal, ranging from severed heads as well as a severe gunshot wound to the spine and stomach.
