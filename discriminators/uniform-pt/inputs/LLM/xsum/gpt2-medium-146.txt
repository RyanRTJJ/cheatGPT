"Our strategy that we followed for a lot of the year is to keep going. We have worked on our running style and it was something we worked on with the new car to make sure we were still going fast.

"The strategy is that we try to keep working hard and that's something we have tried with the second car and we try to stay in that rhythm. In terms of performance-wise we've got another two-to-three-and-a-half-hours of testing in Jerez so I'm optimistic."

Vettel, 33, will now work alongside Hamilton in Brazil, while his Mercedes team-mate will continue testing in Mexico and Singapore.

Vettel, who won at the Spanish Grand Prix despite taking a puncture, will enter the Brazil World Council of Governments race at Monza with the current World Champion as a guest.

Hamilton will face the three-time champion in his second race behind the VJM07, who completed three of the opening four races as a hybrid VJM10 after being replaced by Hamilton in the wake of his mechanical failure at McLaren.

Vettel: "I don't mind. The thing I did here today was very brave.

"I will try my best to find my own rhythm and my own rhythm after the bad start.

"The first race was very risky as we were in the middle with a red line, the driver was going very fast, it hurt and I thought everything was going very well. We have worked very hard and the car didn't work great at the end. It was not pretty but we managed to be close and at least at the end I'm doing pretty well."
