, but the photographer said he would be "honoured" to have permission.

Now the monkeys, which cost Â£3,500 each, have decided to pay the photographers $250 each for the rights to their photo.

The group will be living in an enclosure at the US National Zoo where Slater has told the BBC they "can sit, watch the monkeys and have the luxury of nature - without people". They will also be studying.

Slater has been granted permission to photograph the monkeys from March 6 until February 14.

He said: "They've decided to pay me for three months of his time - I think I would be honoured."

Slater said: "They are so curious - they follow me everywhere I go in the cage.

"I really look forward to them becoming part of our lives."

Slater had been taking photos of a different species to the macaques for his company, Wild Life Images, and told the BBC he believed he had "put a stop to the invasion of other species".

He said he was hoping to one day move into another wildlife sanctuary.

He said he wanted the monkeys to grow up and become "people - like dogs, cats, people, the way they are in the zoo. They know they are not as powerful as those we are used to seeing in nature."

Slater said two of the monkeys would be female and one male. Both were born in captivity and are the first living births from the group.
