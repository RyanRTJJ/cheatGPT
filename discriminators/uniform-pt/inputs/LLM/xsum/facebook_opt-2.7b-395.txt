 official statement), and whether they will even be implemented at all. The government is unlikely to make any such decisions before parliament breaks for the summer recess on Tuesday, at least, and they could be scrapped at any time before they are announced. The prime minister and chancellor are unlikely to announce the new plans on Monday, when they will make key policy announcements on the economy, public services, and the budget.

But the timing of the announcement is particularly opportune because of Mr Osborne’s comments in the Guardian today, in which he announced an intention to make a “greater commitment” to the UK’s contribution to the EU budget. Many observers suggested that Mr Osborne was making the announcement in order to provide the excuse for reducing the rebate, which is politically unacceptable at this point in the run-up to the general election.

The government’s intention to reduce the rebate has been the subject of intense lobbying from both Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne in recent months, but they have yet to reach agreement.

The chancellor is particularly keen to announce new income tax cuts because of his concern that Mr Cameron’s pledge in April, to raise National Insurance contributions for workers earning over £40,000, is likely to be difficult to pull off after the coalition’s agreement with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party. A statement on the upcoming tax cuts is expected by Tuesday.

The chancellor’s comments in the Guardian, confirming that his own party is divided on his plans to reduce the rebate, give weight to a report in yesterday’s Sunday Times (paywall) that says there will be a reduction of as much as 30 percent in the UK’s contribution to the EU budget, perhaps only to be matched by countries such as Germany.

The Sunday Times report adds to suggestions that the chancellor intends to make a statement on the issue in next week’s autumn statement, the statement due before the spring recess. Although a similar statement was made in last year’s autumn statement, it was quickly dismissed by Labour’s shadow chancellor, Ed Balls.

The government’s proposals would mean Britain would pay more of its own way in return for a substantial reduction in its EU contributions.
