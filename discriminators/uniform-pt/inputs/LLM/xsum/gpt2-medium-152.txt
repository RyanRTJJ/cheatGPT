 goes without saying that with my first year away that I needed to be at my best. But I think when all else fails you need confidence and that's what this team is putting out."

The 27-year-old Northern Irishman has played 99 practice holes so far, with nine more to come on Wednesday.

"It goes without saying that with my first year away that I needed to be at my best. But I think when all else fails you need confidence and that's how I play, I think. I feel that's all that a player should be doing and doing that is working and we're doing it well."

Arnot made 32 appearances for Northern Ireland between 2004 and 2006 but was sent home from the squad in February 2011 due to an injury.

Arnot was signed by West Ham on 15 October 2007 and made his professional debut against Sheffield United three days later, before moving on into the second phase of his career with Bournemouth United back in 2012.

The former Northern Ireland number 10 and Scotland international is available for Saturday's trip to the Whites.

The Hoops are unbeaten in 11 matches since his arrival from Premier League newcomers Swansea City on 1 December 2002. They are unbeaten in their last 16 visiting games.

Aldridge has already spoken after the game in London, who called for a "gentlemen's agreement" and said they have "given each other everything" during the course of the campaign, with a number of players saying their support had been "huge" from the Hoops boss.

He said: "Every time I see some positive things that can be done and I know we are all working on the same level in terms of what we're all trying to achieve and to be honest I have worked with some really good players and I have really enjoyed working with them as well.
