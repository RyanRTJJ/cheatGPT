 patients’ interests are taken into account and that their relationships are addressed.

The NICE guidance makes 12 recommendations and states “the NHS must act now to deliver this change.”

“This has real consequences and means that we may have to move patients from hospital to other settings and away from close family support. This process will not be straightforward and it should be understood to involve the social care team, not just the health care provider,” it said.

For carers and their relatives, NICE also recommends that there is a ‘carer’s network’ who can offer practical help to carers, that the carers’ needs are taken into account and that their relationships are addressed.

NICE also recommended that carers be given an overview of their rights and responsibilities, how they can improve them and how to raise issues with managers.

The guidance comes at a time when one in four people are caring for a relative or a friend who is a patient.

NICE says around 658,000 carers provided care for elderly or disabled people in England and Wales in 2010-11, representing over 11.5 million hours of unpaid care provided to 4.6 million patients, such as a family member, neighbour, friend or co-worker.

NICE points out that carers report a variety of problems including isolation, loss of identity, social withdrawal and decreased self-esteem.

The healthcare provider said it will work closely with healthcare providers to implement the recommendations.

Carers can contact NICE for more information on the support available.
