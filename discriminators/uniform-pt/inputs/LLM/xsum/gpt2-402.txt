Giovanna, who was the No. 1 pick during the first round of the 2016 World Cup qualifiers, returned to the starting line-up as a substitute against Ecuador in the second place round-two match against Costa Rica last July after missing the final three matches of the season and finishing in an odd position as a substitute.
