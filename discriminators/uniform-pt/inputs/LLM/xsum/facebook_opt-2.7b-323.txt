 has been consistent over the past three years.

A third of migrants who reached Greece from Turkey this year used a dinghy over the winter, compared with only 13% in 2013, Frontex says.

"Of all those new arrivals in the first five months... 82% were children and 20% were pregnant women," the report said.

In Turkey itself, the EU agreed $3.5 billion in loans in May as it was seeking a solution to the economic downturn. The EU, however, would only meet part of the costs of the aid package.

"The EU-Turkey programme will continue to be implemented," an EU official said at the time.

"The European Union will make sure that it gets its money's worth, in fact."

Despite the EU support, Turkey is trying to persuade migrants to cross its southern border through smuggling routes into Europe. The Turkish government says it's cracking down on migrants as well.

Some of those who have reached Europe are members of the YPG, an anti-Islamic State militia that is backed by the US and Turkey.

There has been concern about the possible influx of migrants to Greece from Turkey's military campaign against the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in the south of the country, which has left more than 3,200 people dead since 1984.

In an attempt to stop the migrants, Greek police fired teargas on Sunday at a boat carrying mostly Kurds, who then set fire to the vessel, Greek authorities said.

The migrants, who were fleeing Syria and Iraq and are believed to have been heading for either Hungary or Bosnia-Herzegovina, were picked up on board a fishing boat, officials said.

Greece has already seen a record number of asylum-seekers this year and has asked Italy for assistance -- but Rome has so far declined.
