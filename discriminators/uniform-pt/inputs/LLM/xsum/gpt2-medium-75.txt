Steve Rotheram MP, a key opponent of the motion, said the Labour leader's call for a referendum on Scottish independence "has been rejected by MPs and peers". He warned: "In the Scottish parliamentary majority and the wider political situation we face there is no guarantee the British government is going to change."

Labour's bill is expected to face criticism from Labour peers from across the country, including Lord Ashdown, the former deputy chairman of the Treasury, Andrew Gwynne and Richard Graham-Thomas, former education secretary, all of whom are opposed to what they call a divisive referendum on separation.

One senior Labour source said: "The vote on Scottish independence will be a vote on who has what say on the issues facing the UK as a whole.

"We will look to the rest of Europe for guidance and to look at Europe as a whole and why its laws and its political systems are different than our own."
