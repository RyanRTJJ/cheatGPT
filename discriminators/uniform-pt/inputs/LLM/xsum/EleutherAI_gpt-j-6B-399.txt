 new data center at its new campus in Dartford, Kent.

Apple has offered a $9 million job to the man who shot its data center in Prineville, Oregon, a crime that was only discovered in 2014 even though a sign was posted in the front of the building pointing up that it was an internet data center.

The company said in a statement that it was offering its full support to law enforcement, and that a person was arrested and charged with second-degree intimidation. This charge will bring the total possible jail penalty to a maximum 10 years.

At an early stage of Apple's transition to the cloud era, the data center is the focal point, but the company's chief of worldwide operations said that the company isn't doing anything at the moment beyond buying space.

Apple's chief financial officer said the company "isn't doing anything" at the moment with regards to its cloud infrastructure, but that it plans to make "great use" of the cloud going forward.

Apple is still in "serious talks" with potential clients to use the data center in Apple's new campus in the UK, according to the prime minister's chief of staff. The data center is still under construction, and officials said they aren't exactly sure when, or if, it's due to be completed.

The data center is Apple's first in the UK, and it is due to bring more than 100 jobs to the area. According to the prime minister's office, it has not yet signed any contracts with clients yet, but did say that it is "just going to have some more talks" before it finalizes a deal.

Apple began discussing the move at the end of 2017, and in June said that it plans to construct two new data centers in the UK, and build a new one in Ireland. These will include a combined 3.7 million square feet of space â€“ that's twice the size of the existing UK data center.

Apple currently has data centers in Prineville and Reno, Nevada; Maiden, North Carolina; and Fort
