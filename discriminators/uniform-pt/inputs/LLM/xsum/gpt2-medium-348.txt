Their arrest came as local forces raised new awareness of the situation in the Seccombe area after the attack.

On Saturday officers searched a house in Wooding Green in the Seccombe area, where a woman was treated on the scene and was being treated in a number of hospitals with serious injuries. She was later discharged and police are awaiting reports on her condition.

Earlier local MP Richard Bacon described the attack, in which at least one person was killed and several injured, as "despicable".
