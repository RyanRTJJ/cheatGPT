 rewarded with half a billion euros in a new investment fund run by former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.

Bizarre exchange

The company boss also admitted to giving cash to Berlusconi's private hospital in Milan and trying to get a post in the Italian government.

Businessman, Frank Cushnahan, who has been at the centre of the controversy, claimed in a covert recording made last year, that he was due to be rewarded with half a billion euros in a new investment fund run by former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.

The exchange comes after the Italian police investigated Cushnahan over tax fraud allegations.

On Friday, a court in Milan found Mr Cushnahan guilty of financial fraud and fined him.

Cushnahan was handed a suspended prison sentence of two years which would be cut to 1 1/2 years on condition that he pays a fine of 5 million euros, as well as a civil obligation to reimburse nearly 20 million euros in tax refunds and fines on his tax returns.

Police investigating the same case said that Cushnahan had been the owner of a yacht that became the focus of the investigation.

Under the terms of a deal struck in 2005 with Mr Berlusconi, Cushnahan was to be named in a new business fund that the former prime minister was planning to set up in Sardinia.

A year-on-year increase

It was agreed that all profits would be split 60/40 between Mr Cushnahan and Mr Berlusconi - and that he would be given a role in the government.

Cushnahan was to be paid a year-on-year increase.

The judge ruled in February that a financial fraud that Cushnahan's company had committed was so serious he should be placed under investigation for money laundering.

The judge said he could not confirm claims by prosecutors that Mr Cushnahan had been behind a secret investment fund and other illegal activities.
