 each other, and don't pay attention to each other if we do," said Ekaterina.

Although Ekaterina says there was a lot of fighting in their long marriage, she says they did not have a child. "Maybe I should have had one, but I'm a healthy woman, I didn't have it," she says. She also told the programme that she is "proud" of being a homemaker.

The couple, who have three adult children, divorced in 1998 when Anna was 38 and Ekaterina 39. The public announcement was aired on a state television programme about couples in their 40s and a subsequent discussion of the issues at a women's forum in Ekaterinburg.

Ekaterina said the divorce was partly due to their "childish quarrels".

Anna Kogan, a well-known television personality in Russia who gave Ekaterina a television role when Ekaterina's career began, said the show's audience had been "pandered" to and would have been offended by the episode. Television critic Evgeny Khabarovski said that in the past few years, the number of programmes about divorce had risen sharply.

Kogan told the RIA Novosti news agency that the "vulgarity" was damaging the image of women in Russian society. She added that Ekaterina and her husband were lucky they could still have a public discussion about their marriage.

Anna and her second husband, Vladimir Kogan, separated in late 2002 after Anna's public admission that she was suffering from postnatal depression during her pregnancy, and gave birth alone.

The former model, who is four months pregnant with her third child, is expected to make an appearance on Ekaterina's programme.

Kogan told news agency RIA Novosti recently that Ekaterina and Yevgeni's relationship was as strong as any in the show.

Anna Kogan said the Ekaterina and Yevgeni Kogan's programme was not aimed at a younger
