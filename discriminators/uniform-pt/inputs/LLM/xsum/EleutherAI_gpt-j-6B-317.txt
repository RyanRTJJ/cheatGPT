Tough times after good times So if Scott was happy with his decision at half-time to return home and get a good night's sleep, I think you can understand why he might have felt as he left the stadium and passed a large crowd of fans who cheered him...

If there were a time when a crowd would just stand there and applaud and say their own "cheers" - and I am talking about the Liverpool fans in general, not the Kop or whatever - would you stand there and applaud?

Scott's life since his retirement from playing is not being televised, and I doubt very much that it would be if it was.

So there are a few journalists who have reported his story, and they've had an extremely difficult time trying to interview him about the whole thing.

The truth is that Scott, who was 38 years old when he retired from football, is a proud Scottish lad; he was born to a proud Scottish family and went to a good school.

He played professional football for Liverpool for eight years, scoring for the club in the European Cup Final of 2000 - Liverpool losing on a golden goal to the eventual winners, Bayern Munich - and was in the top 10 on the list of the club's all-time appearances.
