 Joe Clarke has played a handful of first-class games for Sussex and has previously represented the England Lions. "Our thoughts remain with the boy's family at this time."

Clarke had just three career wickets after making his Sussex debut in 2006 and he joined Hampshire on loan the following season, where his career flourished. With the county's best average for all-rounders of 17.94 in 2011 he proved indispensable to Hampshire's success, with his first-innings bowling average of 22.23 being the best of any bowler taking more than 20 wickets. He was part of the England Lions squad in 2009 and 2010 before making his debut for Sussex at age 23. His debut came against Nottinghamshire on New Year's Eve 2011.

Clarke has been named in the Professional Cricketers' Association team of the week on seven occasions. His most famous performance came in 2012 when he struck eight wickets for 12 runs to dismiss Worcestershire for just 89 in their second-innings in the Specsavers County Championship to win the County Championship for their first time since 2009.

He joined the ECB staff in 2013 when he took over as the Performance Analyst for the England Lions, taking over from the outgoing Tim Bresnan, and worked as a match referee for the County Championship. In 2015 he was appointed as a Match Referee for the T20 Blast, the shortest format of the game. It was announced in early June that he would be appointed the Performance Analyst for England in 2018.

"Our condolences go out to Joe's wife, son and family at this time. He was an excellent sportsman and a good colleague and an integral part of the England Lions squad," chief executive Andy Roberts added. Former England batsman Matt Prior described Clarke as his "ultimate hero".

"As a kid, we used to all talk about how great he was. If he did anything, I felt like I was playing with a legend," he told reporters.
