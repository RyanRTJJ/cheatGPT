 new plane could fly. The current model has been on the agency's radar since November 2013, when one of the new planes took to the skies in Washington state.

"When we approved [the plane], there was a lot we didn't know," said FAA spokesman Jeff Davis. "It's the first time they can take off and land without having to get their test pilots and test engineers and have them re-test each segment and figure out how it should go along. It's the equivalent of getting an engine that worked and then getting rid of the test engine."

Airbus also appears to have been trying to come up with a plan for the new engine that would work. In 2014, it signed a contract with Pratt & Whitney to develop a new engine that would replace one that is currently used as a backup fuel pump on its 787 Dreamliner. When it was introduced in 2008, the 787's emergency fuel pump ran for over a year on a short jaunt over China to check a fault in a valve. The company said Monday that the design now uses "an advanced hybrid fuel system that does not drain in emergency."

"We're confident in the design and are moving forward fully confident that the design will continue to be safe," it said in a statement.

The new engine — which includes a switch that keeps the engine's internal combustion engine running in case one of the four pilots fails — will require more testing than the current version of the engine used on the 787, which can run for up to 13,000 hours using a small amount of fuel that can be stored in a dedicated box. In order to make this happen, Airbus said it will have to add eight more test engines to the company's existing seven production aircraft.

Airbus and Boeing said the new engine will be produced by a joint venture with a German company, but that they
