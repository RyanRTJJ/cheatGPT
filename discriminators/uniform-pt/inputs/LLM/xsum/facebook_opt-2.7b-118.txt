 were searching for survivors of the collapse.

The number of people missing after Japan's quake has risen to 51, the fire and disaster management agency said Saturday.

About 3,000 rescue personnel were searching for survivors after the massive 9.0 magnitude quake that hit Friday off the coast of Japan's northeast Chugoku region destroyed buildings, triggered landslides, and caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant to briefly lose power.

The government of Hokkaido prefecture said it has evacuated 12,500 people so far.

Kyodo news agency quoted fire department official Tetsuya Yamaguchi as saying the number of people missing has risen to 51 after police cross-checked information with fire crews.

About 2,000 people were still being checked to assess whether they live in areas that need to be evacuated, according to a fire department official.

As of Saturday afternoon, 18,400 people have been rescued, but the search has been hampered by fears of further aftershocks and the continuing threat from the tsunami.

"It's been 24 hours now since the earthquake but we are still not finished searching. It's a nightmare," said Yoshitaka Ogushi, who survived the quake by wading through water wearing only his boxer shorts. But he said the quake had been better than one a week ago.

"I think after all that went on, there was hope that I could survive. I was very surprised to experience the quake again so soon, it's been really crazy," Ogushi said.

Ogushi's sentiments were echoed by another survivor, Daisuke Okuma.

"I didn't think I could hold out until Saturday night," Okuma told reporters.

"The quake was better from the day before, but (we still) don't know if it's safe to return home because there could be more quakes."

The 9.0 magnitude quake struck at 2:46 p.m. local time on Friday. The quake was estimated to have a depth of 10km, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.
