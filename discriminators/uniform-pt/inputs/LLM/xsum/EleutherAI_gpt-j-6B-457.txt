Culture

Museums
A number of museums are found in the Outer Hebrides. The Scottish Islands' Museums Trust website provides information about attractions in the Islands, including details of museums, art galleries and visitor centres in the Outer Hebrides. In addition, The Islands Museum of Orkney and Shetland provides information about the archaeology, history, geology and literature of the islands and surrounding areas. There is a museum in the remote croft settlement of Buaileg in the south of the Lewis.

The Lewis and Harris Museum on Eilean Mòr was formerly the only museum in the Lewis. The purpose-built museum was opened on 11 May 1990 and is part of the Isle of Lewis Museum Group. In 1998, further development was funded by the Scottish National Heritage, and to allow additional accommodation, the museum group was given additional space in 2001. At that time, an additional annex was developed with funds from Historic Scotland, and the museum became known as the Isle of Lewis Museum of Scotland, as well as the Scottish Islands' Museum. In 2009, the museum opened the Museum of Scottish Islands, displaying over a century of Lewis history and presenting a record of the islands' natural and cultural heritage.

Art

The artist Robert MacBryde (1887–1975) painted many works depicting the Hebrides, including the Isle of Skye and the remote Lewis, which he painted numerous times. In the early years of the twentieth century, artists and writers including J. D. Fergusson, J. A. Maclean, William MacTaggart, and W. S. Graham were inspired by their time in the Western Isles to write several works of fiction. The islands form a part of the Hebridean trilogy of the Western Isles by Scott
