When her mother, Diane Cafferkey, began to notice the slow deterioration in August, she rushed her daughter home for treatment.

Nets coach Kenny Atkinson is among those offering support to his former players from all over the league. A number of his former coaches have contacted him with messages of encouragement and support, most recently the former Portsmouth coach Paul Walsh. The player of the season at West Ham, Atkinson said: "It has been one of the toughest moments ever for me on an inner level. Now the hardest part is to let it go.

"It's a long year and the world is a better place for these guys. For me it has been painful and I will always hold them in the highest esteem for what they have said about me off the court. They have taken every game from me and to get a win at Wembley will always be the proudest moment of my basketball career."
