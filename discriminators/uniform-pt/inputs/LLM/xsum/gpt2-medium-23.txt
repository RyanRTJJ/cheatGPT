 in May when it escaped from a fox farm in North Somerset and was captured on CCTV.

Swindon Mayor David Cunliffe was the spokesman for the force, which said it would be "vital to ensure that all animals are kept in safety, especially foxes".

The Environment Agency said it welcomed the decision but asked people to do more to keep wildlife as it threatened the countryside.

The Animal Welfare Act 1996 states: "Notwithstanding anything in this Act or in any other Act, it shall be unlawful for any person to deal with animals for profit or for the purpose of giving rise to any other offence."

While hunting has never been directly allowed by the council it did allow a number of traps for foxes but at what levels would they catch a fox?

A police spokesman said: "We continue to make an effort to bring to an end this nuisance fox on to some level."

Tiger shot, and with two animals

A local farmer said: "We don't know how many we've killed but I've heard it may be 20 or just two. If they're doing these shots we'll need to find out what's going on."

And a senior officer at the county council said: "I have to tell you the first time I saw it in front of me I thought 'that looks like some kind of nightmare to imagine'.

"The second one at the top of the garden, it was running away like a mouse right in front of me. Then the third one, the one in the field, it was up for 20 yards. We've had two of them now.

"It's a little bit of a mystery but it still looks like it could be some kind of monster."
