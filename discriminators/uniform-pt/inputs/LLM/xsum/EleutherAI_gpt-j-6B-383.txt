 final group game against Australia. Sampson stated that he would use all 20 outfield players in the match.

In a first half of the final group game, Canada scored three quick goals before England equalised in the third minute of the second half through a Steven Gerrard penalty kick. Australia scored three more times to win by 6–1, becoming the only team to defeat England in tournament play. The scoreline was not representative of the tournament since all three goals were disallowed by the match officials: the first goal was disallowed for off-field activity and the other two were waved off after Canada's first goal for a handball offence.

The 3–2 defeat saw Canada's hopes of qualifying to the 2018 FIFA World Cup being confirmed. Canada had already defeated their group-mates, Mexico and Colombia, having both played in all three group matches in comparison to Jamaica not being given a chance to win all three matches due to its only 2 points (a draw and a loss) in those matches. Canada now held the second-best record of the three countries who were not chosen to participate in the World Cup qualifiers so as Mexico they had 2 points while they had Colombia with 1 point but Jamaica was relegated to the 2-leg CONCACAF Championship play-offs for the 2018 World Cup.
