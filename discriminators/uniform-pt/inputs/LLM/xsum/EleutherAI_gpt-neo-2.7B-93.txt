 its tracks.

It will take 2,300 miles for someone going from the West Midlands to Derby to achieve the same journey time as 100 years ago. But it took until 1919 – a little over a week in the modern era – for an express train from Nottingham to Lincoln to complete the same journey as two months ago. On the other hand, in 2017, it will take more than 3,000 miles to travel from London to Newcastle.

Rail fare rises will further reduce rail journeys with a reduction to a penny for most journeys from the south-east, north Cumbria to Newcastle, and south-west Yorkshire to Newcastle, and from Gloucester to London Euston, and from the Kent Downs to London Euston.

The government could use rail infrastructure improvements to address the growing number of residents who travel to work and study at home to avoid the growing cost of living, and the government is looking at ways of making travel more affordable for low-income households.

A government report published in January said:?We recognise that travel must become more accessible to make it easier and cheaper for people to live, work and get to and from work and education. A key part of our government’s approach will be to increase opportunities for commuters to travel to work using public and social transport.”

With only a handful of train services, and no public rail links from the east of Sheffield to London, Nottingham could use a new railway line to connect with its north-western neighbour and boost train journey times between the two cities.

The government estimates that the total economic output – value added multiplied by standardised measures from spending in that area – from rail is about £1.5bn. In England, the figure is £2bn.

The report warns of a “disruption to supply chains and jobs” if rail is cut, due partly to the growth of a global market for manufacturing, and how the rise of e-commerce “will increasingly disrupt supply chains”.

The report noted:?Rail is vital as an additional transport sector and a key driver of productivity, as well as key to our economic prosperity and stability. However, rail is growing at
