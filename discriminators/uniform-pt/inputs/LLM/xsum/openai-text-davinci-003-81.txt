The council proposes to close 15 day centres that provide care and support for adults with learning disabilities, arguing that it will save money and free up resources to invest in services for adults with more complex needs. 

Ms Cameron, who lives in Kidlington near Oxford, said the plans are “morally wrong” and that the need for day centres would only increase as adults with learning disabilities become older and more vulnerable. She added that the proposals do not take into account the importance of the day centres for both adults with learning disabilities and their families, who can often struggle to cope with their loved one’s needs.

Ms Cameron, who has three children with learning disabilities, including one still attending a centre, told the Daily Mail: “These day centres are vital for adults with learning disabilities and their parents who are struggling to cope. They depend on them for social contact, stimulation and in some cases, respite. To close them is morally wrong.”

The campaign she has launched, called Save Our Day Centres Oxfordshire, has garnered support from advocacy organisations and celebrities, and has been backed by the County Council.
