ities said he was a Somalian national who had been denied entry to the country.

Marx said he and his wife were seated in business class on Asiana airlines when the man approached their seats and became aggressive, telling them to move. "My wife said no way," Marx said. "He got more and more angry and aggressive until finally he lunged at us and tried to rip my wife's seat away from her."

Marx said Fuentes got out of her seat and the man pulled her back in and tried to stand between her and the aisle. At that point Marx stood up, grabbed the man and put him in a headlock, then took him to the back of the plane.

The flight crew restrained the man and the plane was diverted to South Korea. The incident took place about an hour after takeoff.

"I had to do something," Marx said. "There are certain situations where you just have to take control or else it could have gotten out of hand and someone could have gotten hurt."

Marx said he was relieved that no one was seriously injured and praised the crew for their quick response. "I just hope people can learn a lesson from this and be more aware of their surroundings," he said.
