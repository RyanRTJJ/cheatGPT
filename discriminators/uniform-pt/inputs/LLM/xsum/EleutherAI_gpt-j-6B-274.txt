 Perry and Beth Elkin on the mark.

England needed 17.10 overs to chase 109 and only had 8 players on the field.

Australia were able to win the toss and get first innings in, with England needing to beat the runs needed to take the title through batting order.

With both batsmen at the crease, England were bowled out for 105 as the match limped towards a nail-biting finish.

With Australia’s second innings only just beginning, the tourists would have been satisfied to finish with a draw – but England’s players were determined to end up winners.

England chase 109 to win, with only four players on the field

By the time Perry got to the crease chasing 105, England, as were the other 10 players, had still only played for seven overs.

A win with 16 overs to spare seemed a formality, but they weren’t able to put their spinners in for much use after they put the first two overs on a legspin cordon. But Perry started strongly, hitting nine fours and a six before being caught on the boundary. As she walked off, her celebration was ruined by the sight of a visibly frustrated Emma Rackham, standing on the boundary with a wide smile and no England jersey on.

Perry played some nice shots as she reached 50 with a four and a six but when Alastair Cook was bowled attempting a second four from Rackham’s bowling, England were on 24-3.

Beth Elkin would eventually bring up her 50 with an excellent leg-side shot after the England opener was trapped LBW by an inside edge. But she would be all out shortly after, this time for 16.

In one of the highlights of the first day, all of the England fielders were struck by a high-toss from Hannah Rowe. Two of England’s top three had the ball go high and wide, which left captain Cook at square leg to put her hand up for a catch and stop the scoring altogether.

It was quite remarkable
