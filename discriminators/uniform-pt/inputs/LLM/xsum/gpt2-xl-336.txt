 internationally agreed target of ending childhood deaths before 2030.

The WHO said it expected that the number of under-five deaths will drop to fewer than five million in 2025 - still far too many.

"Even after further drops in under-five mortality that would bring it to the target of about five million - around half - the rate of decline will remain insufficient to meet the target," the WHO said.

"Without continued improvement in health equity gaps, it is very unlikely that the number of under-five deaths will be halved in less than a decade."

Poverty, sanitation and nutrition, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, are all key factors in child under-five mortality, the study found.


WHO spokesman Farhan Haq told AFP the increase in the number of deaths over the past two years was "quite shocking".


"Despite the fact that the world has made substantial progress, the number of under-fives dying needs to be brought under control," he said.


WHO's health director said he was "absolutely convinced" that if these factors were addressed there was a "good chance" all children would be saved from the suffering of childhood.


WHO warned that "the decline at the moment is not enough, it is not fast enough".


The World Health Organisation said in February that more than 1.7 billion people were living in countries that have not yet achieved "baseline" targets on reducing child mortality.


That figure refers to children under five, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, and babies between six months and five years old.


"These countries need to rapidly take action to reduce child mortality and this is happening already in high-income countries," Haq said.
