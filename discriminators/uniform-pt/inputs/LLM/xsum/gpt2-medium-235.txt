On Wednesday, a poster for his war service and his experience of fighting the First World War, called "Operation YBK," will be placed on the display walls of the Gaunt Plaza store in the city's inner south, where the army used to stand.

"A veteran of the First World War told me that war heroes should remember they are serving. My story might inspire these soldiers at least one day," said Gaunt, 78, to loud applause.

He later told Fairfax Media his former soldiers might be able to add a bit to the memory.

"As they are serving today, they will know a number of people – it's going to help them at work or it might help them in their families. It might encourage them to get back into the army so they can carry on the work they did before they came into our Army. They might find that some of the war memories become a lifelong memory," Gaunt said.

His message to today's soldiers – the Gallipoli campaign was like "the end," and not "the beginning of our civilisation and way of life" – resonated with many of the people who rallied for Gaunt at last year's anniversary.

"There is so much sadness in the streets but no hope for the Army – this is an opportunity to bring hope," said one woman, who didn't want to be named. "We are here today to raise the dead and the dead always come before our hope."

Gaunt's father was stationed in Bismarck, and he served in the First World War with the 3rd Division of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (RRF).

Gaunt, who is the son of the store owner who commissioned and installed the poster, will put his experience of war beyond his walls this weekend.

After his centenary, the banner will display a selection of his former soldiers as a remembrance of the First World War centenary.

It will run on the wall next to
