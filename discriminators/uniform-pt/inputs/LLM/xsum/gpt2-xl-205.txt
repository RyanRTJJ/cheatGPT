 permission to broadcast details of the arrests in the wake of a huge leak of highly sensitive information. The operation was not connected to a number of high-profile cases.

Four suspects in particular have seen a significant increase in attention from the police following the leak – former DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, former DUP councillors Frank Donaghy and David Stewart, and former council housing officer Ciaran Meehan. All were charged with more serious crimes than were initially suspected.

Stewart was charged with conspiracy to defraud the state, making threats to cause grievous bodily harm and a firearm offence. Two other individuals were charged with conspiracy to defraud the state – former council finance executive David McGowan and former deputy mayor David Murray – while Dodds was charged with possessing firearms. McGowan, however, was not charged with a specific firearm offence but was charged again with conspiracy and unlawful possession of a firearm.

No other individuals have been found guilty in relation to the operation. Earlier, it was claimed that the leak was deliberate. It was claimed that the police knew about the leak before it was published, yet gave no indication that they were concerned about it. The disclosures have fuelled the debate in Northern Ireland over how and why the police operate.

The former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Hain said in an interview with RTÉ recently that police officers were aware that the names of the people arrested in the probe would be published. He said that would raise significant concerns with the public about allegations that people were arrested and charged under the guise of intelligence gathering.

The police have been under scrutiny since the arrest of former DUP leader Peter Robinson nearly four months ago. But the ongoing controversy will spark fresh criticism of the state's secret justice system.

Responding to the latest disclosures, the DUP has said that its new leader, Arlene Foster, will push for a full public inquiry in to the police investigation into the leak of a list of those who have been questioned.
