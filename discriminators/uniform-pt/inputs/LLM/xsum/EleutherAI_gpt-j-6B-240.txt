 World Trade Organisation membership.

The invitation, seen by the Guardian, came from Liam Fox, the international trade minister.

The tender, posted online, was only opened in June and runs to the end of September. "The deadline for receipt of proposals will be 26 October 2012, and the government will review them in the light of the comments it receives," says the invitation. Those who work for departments across Whitehall will be paid the normal civil service salary.

Fox has a track record as a global free-trade advocate. A strong proponent of the US-UK "transatlantic free trade and investment agenda" he secured the UK's opt-in status for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a proposed 12-nation trade pact.

Fox has long called for government research and innovation labs such as the National Institute of Medical Innovation to be closed down. "People like me are the problem in science," he said in July 2011, arguing that the National Centre for Research and Development had not produced enough innovations to warrant its existence.

"We actually don't fund great academic research. We should have been much better at that," he said.

The Tories also want to cut funding for the science and innovation department, a move that would have wide-ranging ramifications.

The Conservatives have attacked the government's "unsustainable" spending on green energy by introducing a "Billions Saved" review. They argue private funders are not providing enough money to pay for energy projects, such as windfarms and coal-fired power stations, saying that the money will have to come from taxpayers' pockets.

In a letter to MPs, the party says the government spends £3bn more on renewables than the EU average, while at the same time claiming there is little left to spend. This comes out to £1.24bn in 2012-2013, an increase of £1.24bn from the previous year.

But the government insists that it is continuing to press ahead with building the clean growth industries that David Cameron identified in his party conference speech.

The government said last July in a letter to the Guardian that the UK had a "substantial pipeline of significant projects" but that this was undermined by the "severe reduction" in support
