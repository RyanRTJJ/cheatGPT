 by Islamist gunmen, including at least one policeman.

But it has since come under increased scrutiny for its repeated use of force across the country.

In March, armed thugs attacked protesters, killing 24 people in the capital Mogadishu, a country also home to the Somalia army and the UN's Middle East and North Africa office.

The BBC's Adam Lippman in Ocala and Sami Khatib in Dharamsala, Yemen, said the army was still searching suspects and "a few" people "missing" have been named.

The opposition Labour Party criticised what it called "extrajudicial killings" of peaceful activists and warned in a statement - with U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric pointing out the government has no specific policy on the issue - and the United Nations Human Rights Council condemned the military action in the capital.

"The U.N. statement means the situation in the capital is very bad, and many people are no longer being taken to the police," it said.

Earlier this month, the armed group Islamic State (IS) said in a tweet calling for revenge and suicide bombings at demonstrations outside of Mogadishu.

"We need to protect the peace as soon as possible, but they should do anything to stop our soldiers from firing bullets in people's faces," the group said.

The military has not yet declared it has withdrawn troops, but other security forces have pledged to monitor the attacks.

Earlier on Friday, the U.N. human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, urged civilians to "take urgent steps to ensure their safety and safety", and urged more action to end militant violence with the aim of ending the so-called civil war in the country.

The BBC's Chris Allen in Dharamsala says the U.N. office called for "full-scale restraint between parties" and said the government was doing so "by making some basic reforms and by ending impunity."

Fighting continues in several parts of the country, mainly to the east and central provinces but also across Somalia, our correspondent adds.
