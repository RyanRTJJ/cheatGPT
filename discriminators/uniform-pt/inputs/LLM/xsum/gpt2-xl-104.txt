The cartoon depicts Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi holding a cake as a caption reads: "For a moment there was happiness." The caption also features the slogan: "The cake was made for you."

The cartoon - which also features the headline "Boom, boom, bust" is based on a tweet from Renzi, who joked that it was the "worst night of my life".

But the satirical headline was taken to be so offensive that Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera later removed the post and apologised.

It's not the first time Italy's leadership has been criticised for its inability to offer help after natural disasters.

In April of this year, Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi sparked outrage by saying that his government had "doomed" to fail after the country suffered another natural disaster less than three months later.

"This week I said the Government would 'die' … we all know in Italy the word 'Doomer' comes at half price. "

The cartoon comes at the beginning of another painful period for Italy.

Just weeks ago, Italian soldiers were deployed in the country to help evacuate some of the more than 20,000 refugees that made their way into Italy last month from Syria and Iraq.

A wave of refugees left the Balkan states and headed for Italy in an attempt to reach North Africa. Around a thousand of them ended up in Amatrice, an Italian town that sits on the Italian-Italian border.
