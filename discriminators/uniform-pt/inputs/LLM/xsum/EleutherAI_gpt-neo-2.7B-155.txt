 maintain their habitual diets.

The researchers found that people who swapped their usual diet in the US enjoyed much healthier lives and had nearly twice the mortality and cardiovascular risk of the control group.

When the Africans switched to the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet that they were most accustomed to, however, they saw their health improve but their lives were very different.

"We've identified what's important nutritionally for health as well as which dietary patterns are better for people when they change their diet," says senior author Dr Mark Davis of the University of Illinois at Chicago.

"In some cases, we're able to change people's diets as well as their behaviours." The new findings were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting in Washington DC.

High-carb diet

The findings show how a diet with high levels of added sugar and high levels of refined carbs (think white bread, pasta and high-fat cream sauces) can make someone sick.

A diet high in refined carbs could contribute to obesity, heart disease and other chronic illnesses.

"A common fallacy about diet is that it's all sugar and carbs and no protein. And that is incorrect. There are other nutrients that are important to a healthy diet," says Dr Davis.

The studies show that "healthy diets don't necessarily focus on cutting out the high-carbohydrate intake, but on replacing it with a mix of carbohydrates that are relatively low-glycaemic," he says.

"In this study, the people who switched to the healthy diet, instead of starting with a low-carbohydrate diet, gradually increased the carbohydrate contents until they moved from very high carbohydrate intakes to a mix of carbohydrates that have been designed as a healthy diet."

In the US study, researchers started by providing 20 people with two standard menu plans. One was a low-carbohydrate diet (less than 25% of energy from carbohydrates) and the other was the normal high-carbohydrate diet used in many restaurant calorie calculators - 55 grams of carbs and 20 grams of fibre per day, about 20% calories from fat.
