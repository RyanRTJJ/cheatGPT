 in 2015, when migrants began to take the eastern route mainly because it was the quicker and safer option from Libya to Italy, after smugglers warned the western route was overcrowded in overcrowded people smugglers' boats which often sank. The eastern route to Greece has been particularly popular, Frontex says, citing figures from July and August last year. However, this has largely been because the waters off Libya have become too dangerous for smugglers to operate, as a result of a concerted campaign by Italy and Malta, and because those embarking on boats in Libya have faced the most hardship and cruelty.

In the past year there have been two major tragedies: the sinking of an NGO boat on 22 October 2016 which claimed the lives of some 300 migrants, including 58 children and 21 women, and the explosion of a fishing boat, the Aquarius, off the Libyan coast on 31 January which killed at least 39 people and left 32 survivors, 16 of them children.

In the past, the eastern route has been used exclusively by Eritreans and Nigerians with Libyan men in smaller numbers, although the numbers from Libya are growing due to the rising price of western alternatives and the recent closure of the Central Mediterranean route by Italy and Hungary. The rise of Eritrea and Nigeria to top destinations in the past year is thought to be a result of improved conditions in Libya.

Migrants from many other countries, from Syria, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, to Morocco, China and India, are crossing the Mediterranean in even greater numbers.

Frontex says that the main issue is not in where the migrants come from, but whether they will be forced to remain in Europe once they get to the continent, because if they reach another country it is likely they will have access to alternative routes.

EU leaders will discuss the situation in North Africa and the migration crisis at a summit on Thursday and Thursday
