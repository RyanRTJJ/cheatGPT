is called a sunshield, and is made from five layers of special material and designed to block most of the Sun's heat and light, while allowing the observatory to collect and focus starlight for its science. The sunshield measures 21.2 meters long and 4.2 meters wide and is made of five layers of kite-shaped material and coated with aluminum-doped silicon dioxide, which further reflects and dissipates the Sun's heat. Once the sunshield is deployed in space, it will provide a shade over the entire telescope, allowing the observatory to take some of the deepest images ever recorded.
