She said: "I've made it clear he's been arrested for a reason and will be prosecuted and he's facing a maximum of three years in prison."

Murdoch's daughter Samantha had a lengthy and public battle with alcohol abuse before seeking help.

The New York Post reports that she was "drinking as hard as she possibly could" when she drank more than 100 bottles of champagne at the Edinburgh nightclub Electric Daisy Carnival in 2011.

She went on a seven-night stag do in the same nightclub last year.

"I am devastated by the incident and I'm going to take some time away from all that for the time being and help my daughter, who is suffering from anxiety disorder as she lives with this awful loss for quite a long time," she said in an interview with CNN.

"I'm going to do all I can by being there with her."

Earlier, the paper reported that Mrs McGarry had given her daughter the name 'Samantha Mackintosh', after her late mother.
