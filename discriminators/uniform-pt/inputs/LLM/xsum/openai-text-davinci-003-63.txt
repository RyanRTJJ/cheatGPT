 a weekend of activities at the School of Irish Studies in East Belfast celebrating the life and work of the late James Connolly, who founded the Irish Labour Party.

The former Labour leader said he regretted that the European vision of Irish republicans, and their commitment to the universal principles of socialism and republicanism, were ignored at times by the Irish Labour movement.

"James Connolly never flinched from militant action where it was correctly self-advised, but the vision that lay just as deeply inside him saw a re-made Ireland as part of a re-made Europe, free and equal in a mutual embrace of rights and responsibilities," said Lord Kinnock.

He pointed out that modern-day Irish republicanism had become "pro-European" - his own party being among its keenest adherents.

But he said that the European periphery remained vulnerable to exploitation and narrow-minded policies, and warned that proposals for a European federal state could lead to "the further entrenchment of bureaucratic centralism and the relegation of the peripheral nations".

Lord Kinnock said he and his party had sought to use European Union membership to promote peace and development in Northern Ireland, and had used the structures of the European Union to defend opportunities for east-west co-operation.

He praised the current leaders of the Irish Labour Party, and said that in recent years the party had taken a "noble and consistent role" in promoting a united Ireland.

He said he was delighted to be in Belfast for the Connolly celebrations, and said the life of the Irish Labour leader was an inspiration to generations of trade unionists, socialists and republicans.
