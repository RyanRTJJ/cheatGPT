Police, local authorities, the NHS and charities all have a part to play in safeguarding, it continued, and improvements could be made to protect children in particularly vulnerable situations.

The report forms part of an inquiry into human trafficking, set up by charity Trust for London. It was conducted in partnership with the Child Rights and Human Trafficking Foundation, who are calling for better systems to spot children at risk and protect them.

"Victims of human trafficking tell us that they experience patchy or non-existent access to quality healthcare, legal advice, or childcare and parenting support," said Brotherton, who is policy and public affairs manager at the foundation.

"This lack of support and protection is a particular tragedy for children, who need the stability and care of their parents to prevent them from facing other risks such as poverty, exploitation, homelessness or addiction.

"So it's essential that professionals are trained to identify child victims, so that the families can receive the help and protection they need."

The report also highlighted that asylum seekers and refugees were most at risk of becoming victims of human trafficking as they were more likely to be vulnerable and have limited access to resources.

The research suggests that the same might be true for children taken into care and those in rural communities.

The report is calling for better systems for identifying and supporting those at risk of being victims of human trafficking and for a clearer framework outlining
