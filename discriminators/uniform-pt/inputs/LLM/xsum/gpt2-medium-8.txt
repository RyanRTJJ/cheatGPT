 calling in sick from the practice, despite the high mortality rate and the possibility of dying prematurely, and I also wrote about the hospital consultants' claim that they didn't want to hear anything about their work and only heard about it after being notified about the death statistics on May 3. As in the case of the hospital consultants, the number of complications suffered by the doctors who performed the surgery grew substantially from 4 deaths to 37; the complication rate for those who die early increases from 0.31 per 100,000 surgical patients to 4.1 per 100,000 patient-years.

The most startling part of this data is the death rate for those who fail to respond well to standard blood-pressure treatment, with a suicide rate twice as high; for example, the hospital surgeons wrote:

"We believe, however, that standard care results in death and it may be necessary to pursue some other means of avoiding death. Given these circumstances we have decided to discontinue the use of this approach."

I find it interesting that the hospital consultants made the statement as inordinately as the surgeons, but that they chose to make the statement without a single study of this practice. It suggests that an overwhelming majority of surgeons who perform this high-fatality surgery (as it exists) are not "effective" (if even that) in helping patients surviveâ€”they are merely uneducated, but that does not necessarily mean that their patients simply die. There is certainly an argument to be made that this is a form of suicide as well as a type of patient harm. But is it true that no doctors make similar statements in medical journals, when they are writing about suicide rates?

But the most surprising part is the reason that the surgeons said nothing at the hospital consultants' hospital conference on May 3. They wanted to maintain their position on a controversial topic without anyone else being affected:

The most recent information indicates that our patient outcomes are adversely affected. Our patient outcomes are adversely affected by the lack of the proper advice and support services
