 as a result of long-term damage to the blood vessels that feed the brain. "There is just not enough money available out there to treat people when they first come back after a long time," said Jane Evans. "That's why we run these kind of camps."

A study published in 2015 found that many of the children who enter care in Glasgow have suffered severe brain damage, and at least a quarter have suffered long-term mental and behavioural changes. The charity said it had not been able to find a single specialist psychologist based in the city who is qualified to assess children who have symptoms such as sensory problems. Most of those who are seen by consultants are said to be suffering more physical problems, with depression a common feature.

"There is nothing really unique to Glasgow," said Mrs Evans. "We have got a huge population with a lot of people from all around the world, but we are the last city in this country that has not got enough specialists to do this sort of work."

In the past, the charity has helped around 20 children from Glasgow who they said would have died in their native Scotland without long-term care while in the care of social services. The charity uses intensive support but only has 25 beds.

"It is absolutely appalling that a lot of children have to be treated in our country because they end up being passed on to us," said Miss Evans. "We have been given the support and resources to care for these children and the whole country needs this. Without this money, the people who are going to be giving this help will be forced to look outside this country. This will be the end of a lot of British child mental health services."

"There is really no excuse or justification for this situation," said Mr MacLeod. "It's about saving lives. The numbers of children suffering mental health problems is going up every year. This issue has to be tackled.
