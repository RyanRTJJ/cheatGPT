Rowsell-Shand, who won gold medals in the women's team pursuit at the 2012 and 2016 Games, retired on Wednesday aged 30 due to persistent neck and arm problems.

"She inspired me to take up the sport and she has always been a constant friendly face," Trott said of her former team-mate.

"I have so many fond memories of her."

Rowsell-Shand became the first British female cyclist to win an Olympic gold medal when she helped Great Britain to victory in the team pursuit at London 2012.

She went on to win further golds at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, 2015 European Championships, 2016 World Championships and at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

"We always get on so well, she always makes an effort to come over and speak and catch up," Trott added.

"She's always been there to help. Any time I was struggling with something, whether it was with the team pursuit or my individual races, she was always there to give advice or pick me up.

"Unfortunately, she had to retire through injury but she will be taking part in some coaching and development roles and I'm sure she will still be helping everyone even though she is finished as an athlete."

Rowsell-Shand said last week that she was "devastated" to be ending her career but feels "proud" of her achievements.

"This isn't how I'd planned on finishing my career but I can now look back and feel really proud of
