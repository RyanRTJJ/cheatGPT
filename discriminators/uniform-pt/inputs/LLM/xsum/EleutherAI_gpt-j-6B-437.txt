Economy

The Chancellor, George Osborne, used the first half of 2015 to implement fiscal and economic reforms he set out in his 2010 general election manifesto, as well as in the Conservative 2015 election manifesto, in order to improve Britain's economic prospects. The reforms were set out in the Spending Review 2013 – 2015, and subsequently referred to in the Conservative 2015 election manifesto.

Since the publication of the Autumn Statement, the Chancellor has been called upon to outline how his reforms will stimulate the UK's economic growth, with commentators claiming his reforms fall short of the scale needed to boost economic recovery. The Times newspaper claimed that there may be as little as 1% growth over the next three years.

The Chancellor set out a number of new policies. These are briefly summarized as follows:

Public sector pay and pensions
The Government announced a freeze on public sector pay increases, from 2.17% to 2% – subject to inflation. The Government also introduced new policies intended to protect public sector pensions, with the Chancellor announcing that in future, pensions will be calculated at a "nominal" level, in order to allow public sector workers some degree of security in retirement, while protecting taxpayers from paying excessive pension liabilities. The proposals were criticised by the unions, who said they could lead to higher pension payouts and a "bonfire of rights".

Other measures
As part of a number of measures to increase support for poorer households, the Government announced that it would be cutting all "benefits" - including "disease-related and unemployment benefits", from the January payment - known as "dual-benefit payments", to January 2016.

The Spending Review 2015 included a number of other measures:

Social security changes
In September 2015, the Government announced a number of social security changes, including the removal of means testing from housing
