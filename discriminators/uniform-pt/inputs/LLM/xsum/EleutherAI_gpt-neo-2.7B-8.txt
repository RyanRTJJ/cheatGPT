 concerned that my data, showing that a major problem in blood vessel surgery was the death rate, would trigger an ethical outcry.[@ref1] They were right to worry: the story has sparked public protests over how medical professionals are paid by providing services that could be lifesaving, a topic that raises profound issues about both financial and ethical responsibility.[@ref2] It is also causing concerns on ethical grounds, such as whether the data have been anonymised.[@ref3] These concerns about the integrity of the data have been justified with respect to my data because of the nature of individual surgeons' practices and because the data relate to the experience of a large number of surgeons working in different countries who have various surgical procedures that often involve major blood vessels.

If this issue is important, it is important for researchers, such as those in my country, who conduct research with data from publicly available sources. If an ethical outcry does result, it is important that the relevant data are not used to "justify a particular point of view and then stop".[@ref4] If a data set such as this from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) has been used to criticise a surgeon, we, as researchers, would prefer that this would not happen.

The point that has been made by surgeons in the UK is not only about the need for anonymised data but also about the ethical justification for the process of anonymisation. The RCSI data are anonymised, but only when they are published with a disclaimer that they were anonymised only "for statistical and practical reasons in an attempt to protect patient confidentiality" and "for research purposes." If there were ethical problems with this, presumably the data would be exempt from publication. The fact that my results have received extensive coverage in the media does not mean that the RCSI data have been published in this way, and my reporting of the data, published for almost 10 years, has not triggered the ethical review process. It is worth making this point to make sure
