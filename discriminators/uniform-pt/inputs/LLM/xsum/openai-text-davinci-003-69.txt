eople would be expected to turn to them for advice in the same period.

The charities said they were seeing increased demand as households faced major financial problems due to the Covid-19 pandemic and prolonged economic downturn.

Citizens Advice said its advisers had dealt with 2.3m new debt problems in the six months between April and November 2020 - the highest ever recorded by the charity in a six-month period.

Meanwhile, MAT said more than 1.5m people had sought debt advice so far this financial year, up from 1.4m for the whole of last year.

The charities said people were seeking advice on a range of issues, including benefit claims, debt and budgeting. Government support measures, such as the furlough scheme and government-backed loan schemes, had also been on the agenda.

Citizens Advice said it was particularly concerned that people were struggling to access financial support available, due to a lack of awareness and confusion surrounding eligibility criteria. It also said that even if people managed to access support, they would be facing significant difficulties when it ended and debt repayments become due.

MAT said that for many, the pandemic had left them facing “unprecedented levels” of debt, and that lenders had to show “real forbearance” in dealing with borrowers.

Both charities urged people to seek free advice from them of organisations such as StepChange Debt Charity as soon as possible, as soon as they realised they were struggling. They also said people should be aware of the potential for scams and only turn to regulated providers for assistance.
