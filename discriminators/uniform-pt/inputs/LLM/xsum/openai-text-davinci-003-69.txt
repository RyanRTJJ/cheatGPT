currently looking to increase its use for other events such as classical concerts, key artistic and cultural shows, festivals, and other community events. 

The Bandstand, which was created using the local honeyed sandstone, is a popular attraction during Edinburgh’s Festivals, especially during the Edinburgh International Festival as it offers a calm shelter from the city’s hustle and bustle. 

Thanks to its large decking area on-site, the Ross Bandstand has the capacity to accommodate large audiences and to host up a variety of open-air entertainment. 

The council are investing in the bandstand to bring it up to the highest possible standard and the area around it is being improved. In addition to gardens, new paving, seating and lighting have been included in the work. 

The showpiece of Princes Street Gardens will also expand its use for music as plans for a much-needed refurbishment of the acoustic system are also in place. 

By investing in this Edinburgh landmark, the council are aiming to make it an iconic venue and are confident that in the future it will be known as one of Edinburgh’s premier music and entertainment venues.
