 about 17,000 feet.

The package was opened by a recipient in London, which then forwarded the package to the recipient's family in Pennsylvania.

A receipt, an item description and the original photograph are all uploaded to the package's delivery page on Amazon's website.

This is what your package looks like after hitting the shipping box.

It is now available for sale. We're not sure about shipping costs, and have not actually bought anyone yet, but it's nice to know there's something like this on the market to help make sure you don't get lost in a box that is destined for someone else.

Amazon tells us the drone has a "safe and easy" connection to the Internet and doesn't require pilot skills to operate. All it would take, according to the company, is a remote control from the sender, a phone and a Bluetooth pairing with the recipient's device.

There are even special instructions for how to use the unmanned aircraft's camera. It also does not appear to have any "dangerous" sensors.

It's the sort of Amazon-style delivery system that a lot of people were clamoring for a couple of years ago. At the time of Amazon's last drone delivery, it was a popular destination for shoppers and business travelers. Now the company appears to have stopped developing its own delivery service but continues to work with drones for various retail applications.

Amazon is building some drones for other customers, too, and is said to have begun ordering hundreds of them. The retail giant is working with the companies behind drones for its own consumer drones, but hasn't officially announced those projects.

The drone could be used in retail or other types of commercial applications that allow it to carry cargo without needing to be tethered. An image taken on the drone shows it carrying a package.
