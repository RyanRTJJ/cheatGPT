ng his sadness on Facebook.

Greta Thunberg is mourning the death of 24-year-old Berta Cáceres, a prominent environmental activist who was shot dead in her home in La Esperanza, Intibuca in Honduras.

Cáceres had gained international recognition for her environmental activism, primarily focusing on protecting indigenous people's right to their lands. She campaigned for the rights of the Lenca people, who had been facing threats from a hydroelectric project on what the government had declared their ancestral land.

Over the years, Cáceres and her organization, Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH) had faced accusations of links to armed struggle, largely from the company behind the hydroelectric project, and from the Honduran government. They had issued threats of violence against her and her organization for their opposition to the project.

The killing of Cáceres sparked international outrage. Oscar-winning actor Leonardo de Caprio wrote on Facebook: "The loss of Honduran activist Berta Cáceres is devastating. She bravely defended her people and her lands against destructive business interests, and so ultimately gave her life. We need people like her around the world to stand up and protect our environment and planet. My heart goes out to her family and the Indigenous Lenca people."

The Honduran government has launched an investigation into the death of Cáceres, and while they have yet to determine the cause, there is growing pressure to protect the rights of Honduran environmental activists.
