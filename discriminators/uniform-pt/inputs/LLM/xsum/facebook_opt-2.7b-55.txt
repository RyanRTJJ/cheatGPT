 was only released publicly this week.

An officer from the force's child exploitation unit told the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) at a recent inquiry: "In total that year we would have identified 939 people as at risk of child sexual exploitation.

"Of those people, 912 were known to have engaged in sexual activity for the first time."

But that number is likely to be a fraction of the true scale, the IPCC has warned.

Commissioner Baroness Haines said: "The information we are getting from the police is that the majority of these people engage in sexual activity for the first time at age 16 or earlier, including grooming, coercion or the commission of sexual offences.

"Young people should always be aware of the very serious dangers of CSE. They should be supported by the police to access the help they need as early as possible."

The commission is to publish a report next year that will recommend reforms to ensure child sexual exploitation is recognised as a crime, prosecuted and prevented.

The police report also said that in a further 20 CSE investigations, in which there was evidence of grooming, the investigation found "that the people concerned were not believed at the time to be engaged in sexual activity for the first time".

In 11 of these, the IPCC said there were "reasonable grounds to suspect or suspect that grooming had taken place".

A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said that the force had decided not to pursue prosecution in a further 20 cases because there was no realistic prospect of conviction.

A spokesman said that such decisions were made only when "the person and/or their child is not believed to be victims of CSE".

He added: "We need to ensure that if officers do pursue a matter we will not only make sure there is sufficient evidence of sexual offences by these people but that the evidence can be presented in a way that will be successful in a court of law."
