"I have to say that it would appear that you can break the Internet security of Google and Facebook to achieve fairly simple and basic functions within those sites. That's quite startling," said Michael Green, senior vice president for policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Green said the breach appeared to indicate an increasing role for low-budget, homegrown hackers with little or no technical skills, as their counterparts in the East have become better at more technically advanced hacking methods. "It speaks to how deep the security breakdowns are."

Chinese hackers are also increasingly using social media in their attacks, Green said. "They have a lot of people who don't necessarily have IT background or security background but they do understand and use the Internet and social networking. It is really quite significant."

Green said the US and Europe had been slow to respond to China by taking a more holistic approach that combined cyber and information warfare capabilities. - The New York Times
