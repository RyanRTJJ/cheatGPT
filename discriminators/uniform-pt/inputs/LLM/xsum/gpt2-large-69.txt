 consider new plans drawn up by the city's planning department to transform the park, which is closed to the public until 2026. The committee is also carrying out a review of the city's "pink book" of building design requirements which restrict new developments to 60 metres in height.

Coun Chris Collins said the town hall's new plans will be in keeping with the town's heritage – as long as it doesn't infringe the plans for the garden. The committee agreed to a proposed consultation and will consider it in the months ahead. A statement of proposals for changing the park was released this week.

The planning committee also supported a number of changes to the town's historic buildings which also go against the plans, including a move for the historic home of the famous "Green Mile" to become the new official museum – even though this is not part of the original planning. While the town hall's new plans have not changed the plans of the former building site, they are not part of its historic heritage.

More detail on this in tomorrow's print edition – a full report and a draft policy statement are also available online.

We'll keep you posted as to what the committee decides.
