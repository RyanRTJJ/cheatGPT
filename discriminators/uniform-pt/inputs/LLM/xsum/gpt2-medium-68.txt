 on the government to expand the number.

Sikanda, the senior advocate in the Supreme Court, said it would be premature to conclude that the system should be amended from the ground up.

"It is not yet the time to do an institutional overhaul for the AMs which are the basic building block of the legal system. We should not change any fundamental pillar from our civil justice system," he said.

"This is a long-drawn-out and complex process even if we can do it with just one amendment," he said. "By the time the matter is considered by the full bench on the Constitution Bench this year, all the arguments will have already been tried out".

Jaspal Mehta, chairman of the apex judiciary committee, said the court decided to review two motions made between it and Parliament in 2002 to improve the AM system by reducing the number of judges from 400 to 200. "We have found that to make up for the gaps, we have need of some additional judges for the next several years. This is how our society has evolved," he said.

The move to bring in more AMs and a greater number of judges was taken in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's victory in the 2015 general elections with large numbers of BJP voters and the ruling JDU having formed the majority in several constituencies, particularly in Delhi.

It was also seen as the first step to reform the institution from top down. Since then, the Commission for the Advancement of Minority Studies in Law and Justice (CARLS, a branch of the National Commission for Minorities) has also been called upon to investigate whether there is a need for any changes.
