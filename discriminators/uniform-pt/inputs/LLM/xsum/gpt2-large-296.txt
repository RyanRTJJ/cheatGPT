 spokesperson for the New Zealand First Party welcomed the agreement and said they "will put their concerns to ministers as the bill moves through Parliament". The spokesperson said the party would also be asking for the Trade Union Bill to be withdrawn, so as to avoid duplication.

Labour has been reluctant to support the abolition of TUC, saying there needs to be a debate about the role of unions.

The spokesperson had "no hesitation" in saying it would put New Zealand at a "significant disadvantage" in trade. Mr Green, who has said he would not vote for TUC abolition, also noted that Labor's support for it was also "a mistake".

"I do think the Greens make better political decisions," he said, adding "I think that is true of the parties with which I disagree".

Mr Green said Mr Keating had "got us into this mess", adding that "we have lost our way", which led to "sensationalisation and politicisation" of issues. He said he looked forward to the debate on the bill, which should take place by the end of April, when it will return to committee. He said the Opposition would not support TUC abolition because they "haven't made a decision to put any money into our own unions". He said the decision to abstain in Parliament on the TUC Bill was a "mistake" and the Greens wouldn't oppose it if they re-opened the debate.
