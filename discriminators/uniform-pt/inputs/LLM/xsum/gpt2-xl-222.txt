 to return from the Highlands.

Mr Davies was the brother-in-law of the father of missing 12-year-old Samantha McLellan, who was last seen near her home in Edinburgh on 22 April, and who has been missing since 15 April.

Scottish Police are now appealing for help in finding Mr Davies and Miss McLellan's taxi driver.


On Friday evening the pair were travelling in a van across the A940 between the villages of Glencoe and Moray in north-west Scotland when the cab driver spotted them missing, according to police.

Mr Davies left them and he and another man, believed to be a third man, attempted to contact his brother over the phone but failed to reach him

The car was later found abandoned near the A935 between Moray and the Port of Moray.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the discovery of the taxi and its two occupants as 'extremely concerning'.

She said: "It's very, very distressing that, over the weekend, after that family has been missing for nearly four days, there has been another family come under investigation in connection with that missing couple. I'm deeply saddened by it and it would be deeply unpleasant for anybody, in particular the family, to have to find out that this happened after they'd already been missing for so long.

"I just hope that in the days ahead that the police are getting all the information that they can to ensure that these families are found safe."

Detectives are continuing to trace the car to see if they can unearth more about the driver and the pair's movements.

Anyone with any information should phone Police Scotland on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

They added: "All information is treated in confidence and will be treated in the usual manner, and any person who provides additional information will be spoken to in the usual manner and will not be identified."
