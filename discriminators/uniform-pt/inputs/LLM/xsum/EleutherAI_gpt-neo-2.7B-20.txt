 the government plans to launch the island’s greenest generation source.

However, it could lead to other green jobs. To begin with, it could make some other small islands, such as Eneos, Arpora, and Rota and Leros in the Cyclades and Omalos in the Sporades look tame next to its solar-powered island. The technology it has pioneered might allow for further development of this technology further, for example, by turning seawater that runs through it into fuel for ships.

If the island has been lucky, it has had an economic boom, attracting interest from international companies and attracting a major Greek investment bank. Yet it has also been struck with the sudden death of its only child, while thousands of islanders are living in desperate conditions, many without a job.

It has been hit by a natural disaster. Last summer, a tsunami killed nearly 40 people and washed the island’s entire airport out to sea. The island was also hit, with one in ten residents living in permanent or temporary homeless conditions. “In my time, I’ve never seen anything like this. If I had to put a number on it, it’s 10 million people hit by the economic tsunami of the financial crash,” said Andreas Kolomides, its civil defence adviser.

The government asked the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent and Unicef to help it by supplying medicines and food to those who needed it and by training people how to cope with temporary homelessness. Hundreds of houses and apartments were demolished to make way for the tents, and many who managed to return to the island for food and water have been left with no food at all. “The humanitarian problems are so overwhelming and the infrastructure so bad that we are
