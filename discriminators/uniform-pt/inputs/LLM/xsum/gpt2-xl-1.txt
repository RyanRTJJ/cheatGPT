 the first 18 months, and for the full paid version it asks you to provide a credit card. After the 18 month term has expired the subscription costs $14.99 per month. However, as the service is only available on a mobile device, it is far from the iPhone app, just one in an array of app in the Play store that offer unlimited access to some of today's most popular services.

The service is completely free to sign up.

On the Android site it says, "With access to a world-class online music catalogue of over 10 million tracks and millions of playlists, Tidal is at the forefront of a new age in streaming music." On the homepage it notes, "Tidal Premium is the highest-quality streaming service. Tidal offers users the most access to the newest music and has unparalleled rights to a new generation of recordings by the world's most popular artists. All music you hear will be released under the exclusive Tidal EMI Music Publishing World-wide licensing regime."

Tidal's official terms states it is a "cloud-based, on-demand music streaming service powered by a distributed network of servers" and "for music fans who seek a curated experience."

It is possible to sign up for a free five-month trial.

Tidal's new Android app comes just a week after Jay Z announced a mobile radio service called Tidal Direct and is clearly designed to cater to Jay Z's fan base. The new Android version of Tidal is coming to Android Phones via Google Play on January 30.

Tidal has received mostly positive feedback for the free trial service which means that while it's still a work in progress, it's not clear whether Tidal will ever move to offering an unlimited version of the service.
