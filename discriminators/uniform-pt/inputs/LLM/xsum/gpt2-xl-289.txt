The social services minister, Mike Penning, said it was a sign of the state of social work in the UK and that staff are training to cope with more complicated and more demanding cases.

He said: "We are not only seeing huge demand for support, but we are seeing an unacceptably high rise in cases of child sexual abuse in response to government cuts to funding to social care, with an estimated one in two children and young people receiving support from social work."

The social care sector currently receives around Â£7.5bn a year in public funding in England. Penning said there was a need to make sure social workers and the wider public services supported the workforce that supports children, such as teachers and care workers.

Natalie Bennett, the Green party leader, said the government needed to improve social workers' training to better support the vulnerable and ensure they worked closely with social workers to prevent abuse.

The council said the error meant the wrong people were called up to the function.

"All we can do now is apologise unreservedly as we have been devastated to learn that this has occurred and we have taken swift and immediate action to ensure it doesn't happen again," said a spokesperson.

Pendle House in Newcastle, which handles a range of social work issues, posted the email invitation on Facebook and Twitter.

"If you are a single mum or dad, carer, or any kind of carer to a child needing attention, they are always welcome at the party," it said.

"Hope to see you there and please come down and have a look at our exciting line up of activities for all of you in the family."

The department of health said it did not comment on individual cases but did provide evidence to support its assertion that children were not sexually abused as a result of social workers' errors.
