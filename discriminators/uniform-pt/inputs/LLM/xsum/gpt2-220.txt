 the council since May 2006, and will be promoted.

The changes come as Starbucks is increasingly looking at changing its approach to consumer brands and the way the world looks at its new products. A lot of the change is happening, but one issue is where the big firms are going: if they want to sell fast enough, they can get bigger stores and new ones.

Many of the deals last year will allow Starbucks to expand its range of products, some of which will be small, and some will be larger.

But that is part of why Mr Sanders's office is so happy that Starbucks has begun rolling out more than half of its new brand, with "super stores" for sale – including the new, 10-year-old, Starbucks Superstar – as its goal.

The company will also offer customers more discounts and discounts at locations in the US, Australia and New Zealand. Its Superstar will be available for a limited time through its flagship store in San Francisco, and retailers like Gap, Kmart and Target on Thursday will continue to sell it until a new model is released for that store in Seattle.

The company may also release the new "Superstar" stores in Japan, Europe and North America.

While Starbucks didn't disclose the size of its deals, Mr Sanders said the company could "figure it all out by the end of our [March 10] shareholder meetings." He also said sales at the second store – at a cost of more than $1m – was set to decline. "With this new strategy, we are very confident that people around the world will buy and start to shop Starbucks."

As a result, Starbucks is seeing higher-than-expected growth after the first $1bn deal with Disney earlier this year.

Its new brand that opens in Seattle as its latest is the new "Superstar" brand.
