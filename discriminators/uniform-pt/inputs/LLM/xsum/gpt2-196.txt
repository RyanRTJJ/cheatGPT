. If a local city adopts the new ordinance, only local police officers will report anyone who has been flagged and reported to City Hall.

"The ordinance does not protect against discriminatory activity on the basis of sex or sexual orientation," according to the ordinance page. "It is a policy of all state and federal governmental agencies to consider, address and act in light of these factors to combat discriminatory discrimination and to ensure its effect as a deterrent against discrimination in any manner it sees fit."

The law passed with 66 percent of the vote. "The measure will not infringe on civil rights or the right to self-determination," it reads, according to a statement issued last month.

The measure also "does not address discriminatory behavior in the context thereof, or the manner in which other activities are conducted to enforce rights protected, including sexual or gender-based discrimination." Instead, it states that it "does not address actions that negatively affect one area of the state as such."

The ordinance is part of a broader effort to protect LGBT people against harassment and discrimination after several federal courts refused rulings against the transgender and gay rights movement, which were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014.

Last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found that a Virginia ordinance imposing new restrictions on transgender people violates the U.S. Constitution and was unconstitutional. It also ruled that Title VII of the 1972 Civil Rights Act discriminates on the basis of sex for sex discrimination. The Justice Department and a federal judge for the U.S. were represented by Susan O'Keefe and John Lewis, who argued the restrictions put transgender people in harm's way.

The transgender rights group Equality Virginia filed a federal suit in December in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.
