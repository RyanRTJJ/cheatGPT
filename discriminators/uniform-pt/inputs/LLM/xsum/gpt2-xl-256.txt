Facebook said the service would allow users to send simple messages to individuals they've only met from their profile pages, without having to know who they are.

But its current Facebook Messenger app does not allow the app to transmit any messages, because of the requirement to verify an exchange of messages before it can be seen by people.

Some social networks have started to allow direct messaging after users' profiles have been created.

A message can have a sender and recipient from an account, or messages can be sent to specific people.

Facebook said this new Messenger app would work much like its "People You May Know" app.

These would appear on messages, and disappear from the conversation at a set time after a set period of time.

When the "secret names" are entered, users can "send a message that has both a message and a secret name for multiple recipients."

The company said a Facebook group chat feature has already been in use, but it did not give details about who it would support for secret messages.

Facebook said its aim was to offer users features they may not have had access to before, including the ability to add or delete friends that don't share their interests, which the firm said would be "really powerful". Â®
