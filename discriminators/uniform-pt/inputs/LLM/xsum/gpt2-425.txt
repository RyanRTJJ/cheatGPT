RANG KONG, 1: 'Aerial strike on illegal air base '

There has been no confirmation of the attack, but an Air Force spokesman said the military had asked for assistance in rescuing a person from the scene.

Sawak is the capital of Kogarah state, where the southernmost province of Northern Lujah has been attacked by Al-Shabab militants in April.

Earlier this year, a Syrian militant group attacked a gas station at a checkpoint on the same road, killing at least 34 people and wounding as many as 300.

The Al-Nusra Front also said it kidnapped more than 20 Lebanese in February last year. Earlier this year, an air strike by United States aircraft struck the town of Hama as it was still reeling from a failed peace talks.

Mr Ng Lao moved to an airstrip a month ago, taking advantage of the opportunity to secure land for his five young children to go to school.

"They (local residents) don't want us here at all," he said. "You can't be one of those people who has to take part in war."

The family members believe a government-imposed evacuation will help stabilize Kang's rural community.

He has also been holding rallies calling for an end to the siege on his land.

Another of his children had a new father, Mr Ng Yingtai, after he was shot in the abdomen in the past week.

Lahore's government says the siege is the result of a crackdown by the Nusra Front that killed its leader, Jabhat al-Nusra.
