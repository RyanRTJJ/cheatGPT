 Europe for the last three races, and we'll take a quick look at how the top tier teams fared in their opening outings.

The first of three races is in Italy at Mugello, and then the second race weekend is in Belgium, which should provide fans and observers with their first opportunity to take a close look at Ferrari's new-found performance. But the last race in Abu Dhabi is when the championship will really be decided.

In Mugello, Ferrari did everything right. They started with the new SF90, and in true Ferrari fashion they have made changes that were not there before. The big change is the introduction of an endplate in the carbon fibre tub in order to protect the floor area from impact damage. This change was made after the accident to Pascal Wehrlein, and it is safe to say that it seems to be working. Hamilton spun twice during practice, but both spins were relatively harmless. The main change Hamilton made however, was to back off the front wing. Most teams run the rear wing out to the end of the barge, but Lewis managed to drop it to the bottom section in order to make the car more track-biased. Ferrari also managed to keep Mercedes running close behind with their updates, as they did with their 2016 car.

In the race, Hamilton qualified on pole ahead of Max Verstappen, meaning this is the very first time that a driver's first win at the circuit has been decided by who gets pole. That is a good sign for the team, and it seems that they are on the brink of winning their first race. The Mercedes team has not been able to solve the problem that many fans believed they had last year. For the whole season, they were the car to beat, but it all fell apart as they missed the first few races of the year, meaning that Lewis Hamilton had another year of waiting to feel like he was in control.

So far, Hamilton has won the first two races this year, and I expect Max Verstappen to win the third, in Belgium. He is only 2 points behind Lewis in the standings, which
