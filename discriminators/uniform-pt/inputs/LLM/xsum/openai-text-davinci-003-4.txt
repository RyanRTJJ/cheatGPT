The deaths at the 2016 festival of two teenagers were tragic and deeply saddening. The decision by Pukkelpop to take a break from the festival in 2017 is one that will hopefully help ensure the safety and well-being of attendees in the years to come. The organizers of the festival have expressed their commitment to improving the safety of the event, and will be in contact with local authorities and emergency services to ensure that all of the necessary measures are in place to prevent any similar incidents in the future. The festival will also be reviewing its security protocols to ensure that all attendees feel safe and secure.
