The Trust also reported that buildings such as North Manchester’s Mortuary were "completely unsuitable". In addition, the report also uncovered overcrowding of the Emergency Departments and operating theatres at both hospitals, with staffing levels considered inadequate. It was also found that older buildings both lacked in accessibility and posed a significant fire risk.

In response to the uncovered problems, the Trust has taken steps to address the identified concerns. This includes a plan to spend £39.5 million to improve facilities at Royal Oldham Hospital and £13.5 million at North Manchester General Hospital. Additionally, long-term strategies have been put in place in order to improve facilities and patient experience, such as modernising and expanding accommodation for both ward and outpatient services, and increasing staff numbers to address capacity issues in the theatres and emergency departments. Further to this, the Trust is also focused on the maintenance, refurbishment and reorganisation of existing buildings, with focus on ensuring all buildings meet current fire and safety regulations. 

In the more immediate future, the Trust and hospital staff are committed to providing a safe, welcoming and clean environment for both staff and patients. This is being achieved through daily deep cleans, weekly and monthly ward checks, frequent pest control and repairs and maintenance. The Trust has also set up a dedicated Covid-19 Unit, which is fully equipped and staffed to support the local community amid the Pandemic. 

The plan is intended to ensure the long-term, sustainable provision of safe, high-quality and accessible NHS services, with the Trust
