 despite the efforts of dedicated officers, many parts of the country's built heritage are still at risk, especially from vandals.

The latest wave of damage is a stark reminder of what can be done to iconic parts of the country's history. The church at Longcroft, which dates to the Middle Ages, was robbed of a 10th Century stained glass window worth a "small fortune" while thieves broke into the Royal Mint in St Giles' Church, Canterbury, and made off with a 14th Century medallion adorned with a portrait of King John.

Both the National Heritage Memorial Fund and Historic England have backed the campaign to encourage the police and other agencies to prioritise heritage crime.

Sensitive to the public safety aspect of such crimes, which often involve the theft of national relics, the government is also understood to have made changes to the law that could increase sentences for offences against the country's cultural heritage.

The Campaign to Preserve Britain's History, which is supported by the National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF) and Historic England, and backed by national museums, wants an increase in the statutory maximum sentence for stealing the Crown Jewels to 30 years and for the theft of historical art and artefacts to 24 years. It also wants increased funding for police and other agencies to detect heritage crimes.

As well as a campaign to encourage officers to look harder at offences committed against the country's historic buildings, the campaign wants to tackle the problem of "wilful and malicious damage", which covers malicious damage as well
