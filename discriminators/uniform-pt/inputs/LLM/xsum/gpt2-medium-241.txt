Randy Loparazzo, from the Newgate Estate, said his family had been leaving for a holiday at the weekend when they were warned by the Lendel Place residents that smoke was billowing out of the building.

"I couldn't see more than a few paces, I knew people were close by but it was too far that I couldn't go and then it hit us again."
