 during the Nazi occupation it was not a question of whether Britain could become Marxist but how. Britain had been "a revolutionary socialist nation in the old days", and he added, "I do not consider Marxism to be in any way foreign [to Britain], certainly in modern circumstances."

Briefly, at the beginning of World War II, the Communist Party was banned in Britain, and many of its party members had gone underground. However, by December 1943 a small group of Communist supporters, including George Lansbury, the Labour Party's chairman, formed the British Section of the Comintern, an organisation which continued, during and after the war, to campaign in England for communist revolution. The party was, however, outlawed again in 1945.

At the beginning of the 1950s, British socialism had broadened to encompass a greater variety of political views, many of which were sympathetic to communism. But as the Communist Party became increasingly anti-democratic, and as the Labour Party became increasingly socialist, the influence of communism began to decline. On the other hand, it was during this same period that the Labour Party began to move closer to the communists' ideological positions on the national question.

By 1959 the party's official stance had shifted to one that was more critical of democracy. By 1964, the Labour Party was more likely to be led by communist members than was previously the case, and many of its activists and MPs had been involved in communist politics for quite some time.

A number of British socialists now moved into the 'new' Labour Party. Many had joined the party during the war, because they were not allowed to join other socialist parties. Others joined after the war, and became disillusioned with the Labour Party's authoritarianism.

A number of British socialists, including G. S. Harcourt, J. T. Moxon and the Marxist historian A. J. P. Taylor, started their own left-leaning parties in the 1950s and 1960s. There was some debate at the time as to whether the New Left was a left-wing tendency in its own right. Others, such as the socialist economist Hugh Dalton, considered Marxism to be a political ideology – albeit a useful one –
