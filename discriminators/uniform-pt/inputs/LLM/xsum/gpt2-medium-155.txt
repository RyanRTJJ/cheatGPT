 switch to a high-fat, low-fibre diet.

They found that the effect was slightly enhanced in adults who had already lost weight but not at the expense of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.

'We don't know why it happens. We just know that people may notice their glucose tolerance has improved,' Prof Stirling said.

'And we're confident we've made the case that it is due to these changes in eating habits that produce fat metabolism.

'I don't think it is only men. It's a consistent effect over time.'

The researchers also found that people who switched to the low-fat, high-fibre diet were less likely to develop type 2 diabetes or develop heart disease

And Prof Stirling, who led the latest research, said the findings suggest people can improve their glucose tolerance by eating more fat.

'When you're really good at eating fat, we would also expect it to have beneficial effects on the body,' he said.

While people who consumed diets high in saturated fatty acids and carbohydrates were also told to lose weight, only two-thirds of those who switched switched to a low-fat, high-fibre diet.

The researchers said high-fat diets are known to decrease fat synthesis, which leads to storage of carbohydrates and higher levels of cholesterol, which leads to heart disease â€” but they said it could be argued that a lower fat intake is better for your health.

They are also convinced that it is possible to make people lose weight by changing their diet and not necessarily changing how much food you eat.

This isn't just because fat is bad for you but also because we do too much of it, Prof Stirling said.

This makes them 'the last group' of people we should try to do things to eat less fat with

'There are lots of people who don't want to eat fat but they think otherwise, but they really need to eat more fat. This isn't just because fat is bad for you but also because we do too much of it.'
