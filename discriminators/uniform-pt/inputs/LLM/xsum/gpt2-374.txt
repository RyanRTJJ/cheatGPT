 and fullback Jame Brown (centre) and midfielder Sam Smith are now out of the match for Newcastle's Premiership match against West Bromwich Albion on Sunday.

"He's a big one-sided midfielder," coach Darren Randolph said. "I think after that he had a very strong performance against Burnley. He's got his mind right.

"You see him out there in the midfield he's a huge difference in the team and a great player for what is supposed to be a small side. When you come into his first game and see his body at the moment, it's a big difference and you're looking to find him, it helps a lot. He does a good job and he's a big piece in the team."

The 33-year-old's decision comes after his club's previous home loss to Hull City at Wembley last month, a 24-13 defeat and relegation to the Championship.

The Warriors made their first appearance since coming to Southern California in January, ahead of a trip to San Francisco in the second round before an earlier trip to Nottingham Forest 2-1 ahead of the Baggies' first fixture on Saturday, October 22.

The Warriors then moved to the semi-final of the season, winning their last four matches against Crystal Palace and Sunderland.

"He's a very gifted guy," Randolph said. "He brings pace and a lot of energy to the group with him.

"He's got a lot of physical attributes that bring some great power but also he's really got a natural touch and the mentality for what he's going to do. He's a big difference in the team but he's definitely a big part of the team and he'll do really well if he can be on his feet and he can do well for his side.

"My other thing about him is that he's an unbelievable player and that's a big part of what he has. He's really good in every aspect."

The team's defence has struggled with injury but is likely to continue throughout this season and play some of football's best defense in the league, Randolph hopes to contribute to the league goalscoring charts.
