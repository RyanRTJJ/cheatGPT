But Mr Suga was quick to add "any such move is totally beyond my control".

The state-owned Bank of Japan has already warned Tokyo that it risks losing its status as one of the top four official creditors if it continues to subsidise the debt of troubled firms.

"The state needs to maintain a financial brake (on the economy) to ensure a sustained, balanced and self-sustaining economy," Ms Kaoru Yukawa, senior advisor to the central bank, said at a seminar on Friday.

Ms Yukawa said the central bank - which is already involved in a US$90bn rescue of the country's banking sector - could "take on more" work if the country wanted to become a "global economy".

Japan's economy, the world's fourth largest, shrank by 2.7 percent in the second quarter.

Bank of Japan watchers are particularly concerned that the global oil price slump will further damage the nation's exports.

The government's finances have taken a hit from two strong typhoons in October and November, the equivalent of a fiscal shortfall of a million yen per household each.

"Toshiba's woes are a symptom of Japan's problems and they are a threat to the country's entire economy," one government official told Agence France-Presse.
