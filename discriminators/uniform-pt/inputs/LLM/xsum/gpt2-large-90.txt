 to worry about the emissions.

"We'll be launching the 1.6L diesel this September," Willis said.

He said the cost of the pollution-reducing technology has been estimated at $40 per car and that this figure does not include the costs of adding the safety equipment like the airbags and brake lights.

As far as the cost of compliance, the company estimated that it would cost around $1 million. With the extra cost, it could cost as much as $2 million to implement the measures.

"We've got an expensive system and we know the cost of compliance will be high. But we've found the technology to be extremely straightforward," Willis explained.

"In a lot of countries, we've had to make big changes to vehicles, such as not fitting the airbags."

The technology was first developed in the United States and is currently being used in cars on US roads. However, it was not widely available in the UK and only began being available via importations in 2007.

The use of such technology means that while there will be some UK-specific emissions allowances, they will not affect emission levels across the whole EU's vast emissions trading scheme.

For the 1.6L-diesel, the UK will not have its own emissions limit for the first three years until the end of 2018, but this may be reduced to 2% below EU limits. This will allow for the additional cost to be absorbed by the UK government in the short run.

The cost savings will increase gradually over the next three years, with the biggest cut coming after 2019.

Nissan has yet to formally announce when the 1.6L-diesel will be available for the UK market.
