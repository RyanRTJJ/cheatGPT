 competing in a one-man ride at the time of his death.

He had been competing as part of a team of four others, who were trying to go around the world in just one year.

Bicester coroner Robert Beldman said: "It was a wonderful ride, going in the right direction until Mr Chard was in an accident. The medical professionals are absolutely distraught.

"The accident occurred in the last 20 miles."

The cycling organisers posted a message on the race website, describing Mr Chard as "not one to give up despite his limitations. He will be remembered as a person of unshakeable belief whose example will be greatly missed."

Mr Leach, 48, is from Leicester and was due to take part in the Tour Down Under with some of his competitors, including fellow British man Ian Hutchinson.

Mr Chard was also a member of the Team Great Britain Cycling Team, which was part of the Tour Down Under race.

A post on the website of Team Great Britain, said: "Ian's thoughts are with Ian's family, friends and Team Great Britain and the team, on behalf of all of his teammates and supporters."

Dr John Brown, an accredited pathologist, said Mr Chard "suffered a cardiac arrest".

Dr Brown added: "His brain was quite damaged, and his condition was very critical.

"He became apathetic and in distress. He was unconscious while being transferred to the University Hospital Bristol."

He said Mr Chard "probably had multiple causes of death", as a direct result of his "very severe injury".

The organiser for the 10-day Tour Down Under, Andrew McRae said he was "deeply saddened" by the "unfortunate and tragic" accident.

"Ian went to Bicester for this event with a very large group of fellow racers," he added.

"I will be thinking of Ian as we consider what follows the Tour de France and in particular what events we are able to hold in his memory."

The event will be cancelled.

It will be replaced by a similar race, to be held in Bicester in
