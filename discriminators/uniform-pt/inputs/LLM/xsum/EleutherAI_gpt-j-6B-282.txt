145-4 helicopter went down around 3pm local time on Tuesday, minutes after it took off from the city's Don Mueang airport. Thai Airways said in a statement that no-one was injured in the incident but that one person was being treated for exhaustion and shock. The helicopter, which could seat 13 people, took off from Don Mueang at 1.22pm to fly to the Gulf resort town of Hua Hin in southern Thailand. It was due to land at Hua Hin's military airport at 4pm local time. It went missing shortly after it left Don Mueang. Initial investigations found the pilot flew into the ocean and contacted authorities but it is not clear if that was done on schedule.

Routine checks on the plane's black box later found it was circling the Gulf in a hilly area while moving at low speed before it lost contact with air traffic control. A massive search operation involving helicopters and ships at sea has been launched but the plane, carrying three crew and passengers, is yet to be found. Thai Army Gen Kornchai, a spokesman, said: "We're not saying it's impossible that it's sunk yet, we have to continue. I think it could possibly happen." Thai Airways said the flight had been issued a maintenance statement which requires airlines to keep track of the aircraft's mechanical equipment. They have also called in aviation authority officials to investigate. But the Bangkok Post said earlier that it appeared an airframe fault may have caused the flight to go missing.

A pilot and two passengers were on board and were believed to be the only ones who survived the crash. A number of the helicopter's parts are being checked for damage at the scene and at the Civil Aviation Department of Thailand. It is not yet clear if it was mechanical failure that caused the helicopter to go missing. But the head of the Civil Aviation Department, Prapat Sook-chai said: "We are checking possible causes at the scene, but it's not certain if it was human error or a fault that happened during operation or maintenance.
