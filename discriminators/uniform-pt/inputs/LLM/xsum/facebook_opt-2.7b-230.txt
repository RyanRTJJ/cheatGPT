inga's supporters.

This comes as Odinga urged Kenyans to reject what he claimed were threats and intimidation of Uhuru Kenyatta's election bid.

Odinga's speech at a youth meeting in Kakamega triggered a firestorm of protests which has seen police shot dead.

In a statement on Thursday, police spokesman Charles Owino said officers had arrested 19 people believed to be involved in the threatening mails.

He said the mails were sent to people seeking to disrupt the political campaigns and "intimidate Kenyans generally".

"The police are investigating these cases as they relate to crimes such as treason, uttering threats, criminal intimidation, conspiracy and incitement of violence," the statement said.

Odinga, who was leading another demonstration after his speech, urged Kenyans "to stand with the people who are being treated like criminals".

His comments come in the wake of police killing of four protestors accused of pelting stones and petrol bombs at them.

'Disgrace'

Police spokesman George Kinoti said Wednesday's protests were part of attempts by Odinga supporters to "cause disorder" before August 8 polls.

"They intend to continue intimidating the Kenyans in their strongholds from attacking them," the statement quoted Kinoti as saying.

Odinga, who addressed the meeting after Kenya's Supreme Court upheld Kenyatta's re-election, called it a "disgrace" over police killings of young people.

He said the deaths were a "direct result of the way police are being used in the election process".

The opposition leader also accused some people of "peddling death and death-related material to Kenyans".

"We need to condemn this because these things are coming from outside the country," he said.

"As people of the country, we can never allow this."

On Sunday, the electoral commission declared Kenyatta victorious in the presidential election, saying Odinga's campaign team boycotted the vote.

Odinga has refused to acknowledge the results, vowing to conduct an audit of the vote.

He faces an uphill battle against the Jubilee
