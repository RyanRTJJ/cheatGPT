 be prosecuted, and faces a prison term of up to 10 years if he is convicted.

In another development, the prosecutor overseeing Mr Ponta's case has asked the chief justice of the Constitutional Court for a delay in appointing a new chief prosecutor. The prosecutor, Cazan Tudoran, is the former chairman of a anti-corruption committee within Romania's justice ministry and has been leading the prosecution into Mr Ponta.

Mr Ponta is accused of accepting millions of euros of bribes from businessmen and of having close ties to criminals. He is also accused of using his position to secure government contracts for his private companies.

On Wednesday, Mr Tudoran published a statement claiming that he was being targeted by Mr Ponta's lawyer, Dan Ion Chiteanu, in an attempt to disrupt his work.

"After being denied his salary since the start of the trial he wants to disrupt my work and the work of my team," Mr Tudoran said in an interview before a parliamentary committee on justice and family affairs.

"By doing so he tries to discredit me, my office and my colleagues. This is unacceptable from a judicial official."

Mr Chiteanu has hit back. In an open letter, he said that Mr Tudoran could no longer use any of the legal principles he had been taught during his career.

"I am a human, too, my love of democracy and justice must be protected," Mr Chiteanu wrote.

The case against Mr Ponta has been closely followed in both Romania and the EU, with the European Commission and some member states raising concerns over the political risks to the country's reform drive.

Critics of Romania's anti-corruption drive have accused the justice ministry of overreach, noting that Mr Ponta's former allies in government are now at the helm of the anti-graft body.

The EU's anti-fraud team has said it is considering making Romania to pay part of the more than 9bn euros (Â£7.5bn) that it has said has been stolen from public coffers.
