 November 2014. The driver of the lorry was fined $5,000 after pleading guilty to dangerous driving.

The court heard that Bennison had been working for a local construction company when the collision happened, and had been on his way from Pont-cyddyn toward Mold when he crossed the median.

Mr Justice Peter Jackson said: "When the defendant started to pass the plaintiff, the lorry immediately veered left and hit Mr Bennison on the left side of the vehicle."

Mayor was driving ahead of Bennison, and it was Bennison's car that collided with the lorry.

The sentence of $5,000 means that the insurance company will most likely pay out less to the driver than if they had pursued a reckless action case.

The court heard how Bennison had been taken to intensive care after the crash, and was left with extensive leg injuries, a dislocated shoulder and bleeding on the brain.

In a victim impact statement, Bennison's fianc√©e Sharon Williams told of the emotional toll the accident had had on her love of her husband and her son.

She said: "It has been a huge shock for my family, and my son too. We've all now seen the outcome and I'm just hoping the family can move on from this awful experience and find some sort of peace."

Outside court, Chief Superintendent Ian Scott of Police in Mold spoke out about how the case had affected the officers involved, which he said was very different from the norm.

"Not every collision carries out the court hearing, which leads to a different set of circumstances. This is what happens when a car goes head on into a cyclist," said Mr Scott.

"It's almost always down to the driver of the car that is charged so I must say that is not the norm."

Cheshire Police said they would keep the victim and Bennison in their thoughts at this time.
