 as it is last yearâ€™s lowest level in two years.

While unemployment remained at its lower level, it has now fallen for two months on the trot. It is interesting to note that while unemployment has fallen a full two percentage points, the labor force participation rate has risen to 62.7%, which is the highest since March of 2008. However, the participation rate is still 5 points lower than it was in January 2009, and is 1.4 point behind January of last year. The unemployment rate is now 2.1 percentage points lower than it was at the peak of the recession in July of 2009, and in December 2010.

For the first time since the start of the recession in December 2007, unemployment is now below 7%. The peak of the recession was 9.3% in January 2009.

In the labor market, the employment to population ratio has now reached the highest it has been since the turn of the century, which is at its lowest the beginning of the recession in February of 2009 and March of 2008.

The labor force participation rate has now been above 62.2% for 25 consecutive months, and the labor force has been below 62.3% for just one month.

In the chart below, you will notice that when the unemployment rate has been below 7%, it has been a relatively slow month to month increase in the level of employment. However, in the past 25 months, employment has been rising by 0.7 to 0.8 million jobs per month.

From the data that is available, the level of unemployment, and the level of employment seem to be closely tied together. For example, if the labor force has been growing at a 3% rate, on average, for the past ten years, then there would be around 5 million people entering the labor market. However, if just 250,000 job openings were available at the average employment rate, only 2.5 million people would be needed in the labor force.

The reason for the tight connection between the level of unemployment at the time a person enters the labor market, and their likelihood of finding a job when looking for employment is that these are the
