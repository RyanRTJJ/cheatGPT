 rugby," he says. "The game we have here in this county will certainly benefit from playing a more traditional style."

He adds: "Ireland are very much like Wales; they try to play as a cohesive unit. There's a high level of communication between the players. Obviously, the captaincy of any team is crucial, but I believe that there are so many good players – all the players I've come across are exceptional in what they do – that you don't have to be a team player to make an impact. They are all so willing to work hard and the team is very professional at all levels; that will help."

That said, the Munster scrum will have to be as effective as they have been in the first two rounds to make a dent against a very physical Irish defensive line. "We just have to be accurate on set pieces and make sure that we don't get bogged down on the fringes where there's less width," said Nicol. "If we do that, I think that Ireland will be a tough team to play against. You look at their lineouts and they make shortening your lines very difficult. People will be looking to try and take out the wing, which will be difficult, but they will have to be accurate too. So we have to be careful that we're not making life too easy for ourselves with short sharp ball. If we can do that and keep our lineouts on the fringes and get a good lineout throwing from that, we have a good chance."

Irish players and coaches have noted the "very physical" way Ireland's backline plays; with all four Welsh players, Richie Gray, Jonathan Davies and Mike Phillips all playing strong, consistent metres on their shoulders. "I've played rugby throughout my life," says Nicol. "I've played rugby on the edge of a road, which is very, very different to playing at a big Irish ground in Dunedin. The physicality here is very different. Our first game of the season [at the Blues] was so much better in terms of physicality than the two previous games but this is a different level.

"When you play the top players against
