 a US drone have led the foreign troops to "assist the al-Shabab in operations around the country".

The US, which considers Somalia and Somalia to be "the most dangerous terrorist states on Earth", called the airstrikes the work of the Al-Shabab forces that are fighting Islamist militants in Somalia and, despite the US intervention, they have not been stopped.

US officials, who were not authorised to speak to the media at the time of publication, did not respond to requests for comment on the reports that Washington had launched a missile, but confirmed they were carrying small arms and were attacking al-Shabab fighters on the ground, in an effort to bring them down.

The strikes by the US drone were seen as being part of Somalia's "war against al-Shabab," a conflict which is seen as an "occupation by al-Shabab forces" on the ground in Somalia, according to the official. Al-Shabab is a term used to describe groups from which al-Shabab militants have spread the term "jihad".

US President Barack Obama has previously called for al-Shabab, which is also recognized as al-Qaeda, to "stop attacking" the West.

Mr Obama said he was working with US and African officials to help bring on a special committee appointed by US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta to seek US support for the Somalia operation, as well as the international military support for those of the armed forces of other foreign powers.

"I look forward to continuing to support the committee's work to bring al-Shabab's activities under international supervision," he said, adding that it had "an international interest to help restore stability to Somalia".

Houthi leader and president Masoud Barzani, who is also on the Somali committee, has said he fears for his own life and is fighting for the fate of his country's former governor, Mohammed Abdullah al Mahdadi, in a war he believes is not yet over.

He has launched a major offensive against al-Shabab, including launching a series of attacks against Kenyan forces, as well as attacks
