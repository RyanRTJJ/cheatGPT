 see how he responds to game time."

England manager Stuart Lancaster said: "Jamie is working really hard on his rehabilitation. Hopefully he gets a decision in the near future and we can get Jamie back at the start of next season in time for us to kick off with a good challenge in the Six Nations."

Duffy, who played for England at the 2010 World Cup, is set to return to the England squad after spending time on the sidelines as he was forced to come off with a hamstring injury.

England Under -23s director of rugby Dean Richards said: "It is an unfortunate setback for Jamie.

"He did a lot of rehab last week and a lot of our players were on the bench. It has put us in a bit of a pickle to see how he is to come back to international rugby."

Glenn Furlong and Mike Brown are likely to start up front alongside James Haskell for Lancaster's side which has lost seven of its last nine matches.

"It is a huge task for the boys but we had to do it," said Lancaster. "It is a massive task for everyone but I am hugely pleased with the way they gave in and performed at the top end."

The England players have only won two of their last 18 matches and are second behind second-placed New Zealand in the Six Nations table after playing seven matches.

"We are getting down in the middle of the table and are in danger of falling out, we need more points," said Lancaster. "If we cannot get a bonus point for that then we will have another chance to pick up points in the next five games."
