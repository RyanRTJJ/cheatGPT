ley Royal Navy began to evacuate the vessel in mid-April. The next two months saw many minor delays to the ships' scheduled repair and repair (mainframes). The first one, a 6ft long, single-cylinder engine, was damaged and destroyed - the first time two ships had done its work at sea. The second, a 3Â½-inch double-cylinder single-cylinder engine has been missing since June 2011. The aircraft had a crew from the Royal Aircraft Society and an RAF crew of 13 crew members.

Two ships were taken from Inverley and one remained. Crews from British Navy, Royal Navy and Royal Marines were evacuated in all three ships. Two others were taken to Halifax, to meet rescue and recovery teams who were at that time on a search mission. One was taken by a British navy aircraft.

In one of these cases, crew from two ships were also taken aboard ships from the Royal Royal Navy.
