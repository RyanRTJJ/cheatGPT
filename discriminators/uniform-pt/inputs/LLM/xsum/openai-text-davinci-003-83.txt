 crowd at Forest Hills in New York City.

The match lasted two hours and 13 minutes and at times it looked as if Fry had a real chance of upsetting the American. He served notice of his talent when earlier this year he reached the Wimbledon semi-finals, making him one of the best players in world tennis at the time.

At Forest Hills, Fry took the first set 6-2, creating waves among the tennis fans in attendance and setting the stage for a classic match. Djokovic then levelled the match at one set apiece with a 4-6 win.

The third set went to a tiebreak and Fry showed tremendous resilience, saving five match points. However, it was Djokovic who emerged victorious and ended the match by serving out the ninth game of the tiebreak.

With the win, Djokovic moves on to the quarter-finals and will face Austria’s Dominic Thiem. Sadly for Fry, his run has come to an end and he will now return to the grind as he continues to climb the world rankings.

Whether it’s playing in the big tournaments or through his drive and determination, Dan Fry has made it very clear that he is one of the most exciting upcoming players in the sport. He goes home with a lot of pride and will certainly be one to watch in the future.
