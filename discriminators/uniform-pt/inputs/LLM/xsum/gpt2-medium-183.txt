 appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 29 January 2017.

The SFO has launched charges of fraud, false accounting and making representations to an insurer, to assist in the commission of a crime.

Three of the defendants are:

Jonathan Cawley - from Chiswick North in East London - has been charged with taking money from insurance companies while his wife - who is also a trader from Chiswick North - is alleged to have taken part in a scheme to defraud a UK bank of £75,000. The wife was a customer of the London Stock Exchange listed firm UBS. UBS said it has "no knowledge of this activity".

- from Chiswick North in East London - has been charged with taking money from insurance companies while his wife - who is also a trader from Chiswick North - is alleged to have taken part in a scheme to defraud from £75,000. The wife was a customer of the London Stock Exchange listed firm UBS. The company said: "UBS cannot confirm whether its financial adviser received any payments from the defendant Jonathan Cawley."

A fourth defendant - from Tynemouth, near Ipswich - has been charged with making a false statement to an insurer. The company said: "UBS could not reveal if any payments were received by Mr Darlene Cawley which may have included a sum of money."

The SFO said it received information in late 2013 and early 2014 (about May 2012 - about eight months ahead of the 2014 general election) that Mr Cawry "engaged in the fraud and made representations designed to enable an insurer to make an initial claim in the United Kingdom which could have had an effect on the market value of the insured's stock".

The SFO told the Observer that a decision to charge the people concerned was taken in November 2013 during proceedings before the High Court in London, where the charges had been filed.

The agency said it expected the defendants to appear
