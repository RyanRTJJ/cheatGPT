 suddenly – which causes stress and a “catastrophic collapse of the mind and body” – but more than 50,000 people in Britain are left on long-term sickness benefit.

“This is not just a problem affecting the lives of claimants, but for the most part of those who work in the voluntary, third and government sectors as well”

“This is not just a problem affecting the lives of those claiming benefit, but for the most part of those who work in the voluntary, third and government sectors as well.” the report concludes.

Its author, Dr Jane Brown, of the National Audit Office (NAO), said claimants were having to cope with both short-term and long-term problems simultaneously.

She added that even those who manage to get off work for a short while may experience difficulties the next day because of sleep problems caused by the effects of having to deal with stress around being unable to work.

The NAO has made a series of recommendations including that:

• Employment and support services to help claimants understand their entitlements and work with health conditions and work-related problems.

• Support for self-employed people, including a means test for claimants to reflect their ability to work, and more resources for disabled people on out-of-work benefits.

• The Department for Work and Pensions to carry out a review of the level of medical advice being provided to jobseekers when they reach the employment support allowance.

• The minister for employment, Mark Hoban, to give the DWP a strategy for developing a new approach to disability benefit reforms, including the introduction of a new benefit to help disabled people do more of the work in their daily lives.

• The Department for Work and Pensions to develop an evidence-based approach to better understanding what support is needed for claimants over time.

• The Department of Work and Pensions to assess whether sickness benefits support claimants’ ability to work and determine if it should be revised.

There was also reference to a call from the NAO for the government to set up a national commission of inquiry into welfare following the expenses scandals and for the department to publish its performance data for every scheme it administers.
