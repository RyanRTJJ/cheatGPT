 Trek co-creator’s return to live theater after a 10-year absence.

Directed by Tony-nominated filmmaker Nana Goldwater, Eclipsed premiered at the Williamstown Theatre Festival earlier this year to critical acclaim and now embarks on its first national tour.

See for yourself why this play — about women who “become the very monsters they fight against,” but whose rage is redirected from their captors — is must-see theater.

1. Eclipsed’s characters are more complex than we previously thought.

The men we’ve been hearing all season in A Raisin in the Sun are just as complicit in their racism as the women of The Glass Menagerie. In Eclipsed, however, it’s the wives of the man in charge who are empowered by the rage toward their captor. And just because the play is set in Liberia, where rape is often a weapon in fighting poverty, we often only hear about rapes as acts of male aggression. Eclipsed asks us to take that rage — so often used as an example for the pain of women in other countries — and consider how those situations play out in our own communities.

2. There’s a really complicated relationship between the women of the Liberian rebel group and their captor.

Unlike many African-American dramas in which the women’s anger toward their captor is often played for laughs, or at least a side-eye, in the case of Eclipsed the anger is real. It’s not easy being held hostage by a man who’s literally a monster. The women who participate in the production and the audience who watch the play are challenged to take that anger and turn it to something positive, like helping their fellow women escape their situations and find safer quarters.

3. Nana Goldwater’s directing can get you just as emotional as your own tears — and that can be really fun.

Eclipsed is not a show where you are likely to feel entirely safe from your own
