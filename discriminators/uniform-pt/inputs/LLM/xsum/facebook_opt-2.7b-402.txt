 for the job at this point in time," said Northern Irish boss Peter Weir, when asked about the future.

Weir revealed that Strachan was the only one of the three managers who has agreed to stay. He said: "Steven has committed to staying now and that gives us great hope for the rest of this year and into the next year."

Strachan was given a vote of confidence by Weir when he led Scotland at the last World Cup in Germany but did not perform as he would have liked and his team were knocked out in two matches by Denmark.

Despite a dismal opening to the campaign, Weir, who has been in charge of Northern Ireland since 2011, is confident that a change in the dugout would not be the answer.

"I have had to make some very difficult decisions as a manager myself but I have tried to do everything in my power to improve what is going on, not only on the field but off it as well," he said.

"I feel I have helped to make Northern Ireland a better place and in the future I would like to think we can push on and not have to go away for a second change of manager."

Scotland were due to play Norway in Oslo on Saturday in what would have been their first international for eight months but that match was postponed after a bomb threat was received at the Norwegian Football Federation. The security company that Scotland used to man the match was not involved in the delivery of the e-mail. Instead their colleague in the team's travel arrangements had received the e-mail and informed the police of their concerns.

The postponement does not affect Scotland's qualifying campaign for the finals in Brazil, which will include a home game against the Faroe Islands in October. Weir said: "I understand the reasoning for postponing the game but it is still a very sad day for Norway."
