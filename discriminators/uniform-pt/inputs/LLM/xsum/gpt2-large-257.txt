After a brief pause, "you could be forgiven for wondering where Mr Kelly is this Christmas season (sic)," a Twitter user wrote, before correcting himself. "Kelly is not with me Christmas."

Mr Trump's comments to New York's CBS New York's 60 Minutes were met with an instant backlash.

In a tweet, former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said: "For the record, President Trump has called in the #FBI to investigate Hillary Clinton's ties to Russia & her use of a private email server; she is a crook who should not be allowed anywhere near the White House."

Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell said: "The #Clintonemail investigation was a joke. It should never have begun."

Mr Trump's remarks came after the White House ordered special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate whether Moscow sought to influence the 2016 presidential election through interference in the U.S. electoral process.

In one of his first statements since Trump's election, Mr Rosenstein said Mr Trump had the power to appoint a special counsel with broad powers to investigate matters relating to the presidential election, in particular any potential links between Russian officials and agents of the president-elect.

He ordered the Justice Department to begin preparing to appoint a special counsel by Monday.

Republicans in Congress had urged Mr Trump to fire Mr Mueller, who was granted a grand jury subpoena in June to investigate whether Russia's election interference had been intended to help Mr Trump - or hurt him.

Despite warnings from Democrats, including Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), that a special counsel would not be neutral and could seek to indict, Mr Trump has been silent since FBI Director James Comey said it will not be necessary to fire Mr Mueller.

Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, remain unimpressed by Mr Comey's announcement, and argued it would be impossible to fire a special counsel given their access to the information.
