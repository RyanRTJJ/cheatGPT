315 is a single-aisle plane used for short flights between big cities.

The captain, also a German, and the co-pilot are both in their 20s.

The pilots had been flying the plane as part of a training course. The German pilot had joined the airline just 10 days before the accident.

The cause of the crash is being investigated by the Civil Aviation Authority of China (CAAC) according to Chinese media reports.


Air China said the plane was carrying 118 passengers and seven crew members of the first class cabin on its way from Beijing to Shanghai when a severe technical problem forced the flight to the ground after less than four hours of flight time.

The captain was reported to have sent an airport distress signal and the ground controllers quickly joined the search for the lost aircraft with two jets and a helicopter.

"The pilot did not give any indication at first but then sent us a distress signal and we immediately joined the search area," a China Airlines spokesperson told the Daily Telegraph.

"The plane appeared to be on fire, and we believe the fire was caused by the fire-extinguisher. We have already handed all the passengers over to the relatives of the deceased. The other 121 passengers and crew members of the flight were well cared for by staff from the aviation authorities."

In a brief statement the authorities said the plane "appeared to be on fire", and that crew were working to extinguish the blaze by releasing air and water. The airline said the fire affected just a small area above the cockpit.

It then dropped below radar coverage for a number
