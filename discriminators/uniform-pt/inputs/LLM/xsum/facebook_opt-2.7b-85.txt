 his leg was shot as he stood outside a bar in Mold.

The jury heard Roberts supplied Mr Munkley with a gun and drug money for the shooting.

The Crown claimed Roberts bought the gun because Mr Munkley was planning a robbery of a bank.

But Roberts claims Munkley got the gun by accident. In an interview carried in the Mold Echo Roberts said: "I believe that I was not intended to make this happen.

"He was in possession of the barrel of my gun.

They must get me to say it was all my fault. My word against theirs. But how will they get that? They won't believe me.

"He didn't try to rob any money. He bought the gun to buy a round of drinks for his friends.

"I do agree that this has to do with drugs, but not that he wanted to rob anyone. He went to the police and they said it was murder.

"He shot me after an argument we had. I was upset and he went and shot me in my legs.

"I've been in hospital for two months. I don't know what else to say.

"I don't know if I'm going to make any sense."

The jury heard Munkley became addicted to drugs after his mother committed suicide.

He claimed he had gone to Roberts for money and said Roberts had offered him £400 when Munkley offered to buy the gun and to give it back if he got out of trouble.

He added: "Lee didn't say he'd buy the gun. He was only going to give it back if he didn't get into trouble.

"I went and said he could give me £400 because I was going to a nightclub and I needed a night out.

"I can remember going upstairs and he was playing pool and it looked like he was trying to have a lot of fun and was doing well."

He claimed Roberts never asked him why he had the gun when he bought it.
