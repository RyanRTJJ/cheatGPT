 broker with significant cross-border capital flows than losing its boss and losing that boss to Chinese authorities.

On April 23, Guotai Securities announced that senior managing director Yim Fung was going to be suspended for investigation and possible prosecution by Chinese authorities over a "serious disciplinary violation." The company wouldn't go into details, but we thought that perhaps Mr. Fung was taking advantage of cross-border investment vehicles to circumvent Chinese capital controls while managing his money. China, in particular, has a long history of prosecuting brokers for capital flight.

The last 12 months have been a rough ride, to put it mildly, for Guotai Securities. On top of losing its boss, the former state broker, Mr. Fung, is now being considered a suspect in a Chinese criminal investigation.

He also will be barred from leaving China because he is considered a flight risk. Mr. Fung is also unable to take up new office positions without approval of Chinese authorities as he
