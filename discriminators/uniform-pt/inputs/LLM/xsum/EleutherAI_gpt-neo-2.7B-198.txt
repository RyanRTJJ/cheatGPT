 than agreed upon in the deal, including "new, better, and more transparent" provisions "that protect our borders, address the threat of nuclear proliferation, and give greater influence to the private sector and our allies".

Obama, said the letter, has "acted far too unilaterally with inadequate congressional consultation" and he should negotiate along with Congress, "which should exercise legislative control."

The letter also accused Israel of "an assault on the sovereignty of the United Nations Human Rights Council" and of undermining the international system. "This is a flagrant and unprecedented challenge to the centrality of the UN in the international system," the letter said.

UN rights chief Navi Pillay said the criticism would not derail the review, which will be carried out by a committee of five. She said the review would include questions on Israel's conduct, the status of occupied territories, and freedom of expression. She defended Israel and said it had done all it could to achieve a peace agreement.

The text of the proposed agreement was published two weeks ago and will be on show at Geneva's permanent committee on January 8. The text of the proposal is drawn up by the six nations that originally signed the UN resolution on Palestinian statehood, in particular the two Arab members and the US.

Obama's plan goes against UN resolutions and a global consensus in favour of a two-state solution that has been rejected by the majority of Arab and Muslim states. The plan is seen as a way of keeping peace at the expense of Israel and in return, it is said, for the US to get what it wants from Geneva: a formal and binding commitment to withdraw from Arab lands and to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Israel has criticised Obama's move as being against the principles of a two-state solution. Israeli defence spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner said: "The president has a duty to be a partner to Israel and has to act responsibly and responsibly."
