000 customers, followed by SSE at 887.

British Gas comes last with 730 per 100,000.

Scottish Power argued the findings should be viewed alongside "relatively short average annual account opening periods and small numbers of customers compared to other firms".

It said that some of its services, including energy efficiency consultations, charge lower prices than others and that this reduces the numbers of households switching companies.

The company said it has since reduced the charge paid on these services by £2.99 to "ensure it is no longer disadvantaging consumers that have more than one gas and electricity supplier".

SSE disputed claims it was a poor performer, arguing that "a number of factors can affect the numbers of complaints received", including the number of years customers have been with a company as well as any legal or administrative processes involved.
