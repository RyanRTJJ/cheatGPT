The employees, most of whom have been with the firm for up to a decade, are now under no obligation to continue working, and have not been paid since December 29.

On Friday, they voted to strike and it is understood they are willing to continue the dispute at the expense of their future careers in a bid to receive pay-off or redundancy package from the administrators.

In a statement issued by administrators Ernst and Young, said today (Wednesday January 4) that while administrators were continuing to negotiate with staff, no further announcements would be made regarding future plans for the business until the final outcome of any negotiation became clear.

The administrators said that “while the administrators are negotiating with the trade union to reach agreement on an alternative to a redundacy package, there are a number of uncertainties”.

A spokesman for Ernst and Young, which owns 80 per cent of the business, added: “Ernst and Young has an obligation to all of its employees to find an agreement that makes the business suitable for transfer back to a new owner.

“However, there remains a real chance that, as there will be no pay-out to claimants now, Ernst and Young will ultimately be placed into administration.”

Sheila McDonald and her colleague Sheila Moyle, who have been employed at the company for 13 and 16 years respectively, expressed anger at Ernst and Young.

Sheila, who now works for the NHS, said: “The workers know what we went through in Glasgow and we are not letting it happen again. We want to be there and there cannot be any more redundancies.

“I’m angry that an administration has been announced before Christmas when we wanted to be spending Christmas with friends and family.”

Sheila Moyle added: “The workers voted to come out. All they have asked for is to be properly protected by a consultation period.

“We don’t want to lose our jobs to a new owner. It is bad enough losing your job to an administration. It would be better if they went to make a company in another industry.”
