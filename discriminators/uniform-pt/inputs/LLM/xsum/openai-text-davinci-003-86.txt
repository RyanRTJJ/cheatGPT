Chief Executive Reed Hastings said the company is benefiting from long-term market trends, including consumer “shift from linear television to on-demand viewing.” He added: “The internet is transforming entertainment, while providing both opportunities and challenges.”

The strong earnings also included an increase in global subscribers — up to 130 million — as well as an increase in North American subscribers to 60.2 million.

Netflix reported $3.9 billion in revenue in the first quarter — up 27% from the prior year — and its net income rose by 50% year-over-year to $290 million. Hastings attributed some of the growth to a new price increase in the U.S., which was announced in October 2017.

Netflix also gave a strong outlook for the rest of 2018. The company said it expects to add as many as 7.5 million subscribers in the second quarter, on top of its currently high subscriber base.

Netflix has been investing heavily in new content, including increasing its spending on original shows and movies from an estimated $6 billion in 2017 to $8 billion in 2018. The company said it plans to spend up to $13 billion in 2019.

The results indicate that Netflix’s strategy of content production and acquisition may be bearing fruit. The company is facing increasing competition from rival streaming services, including Amazon Prime and Hulu, and the quarter’s strong performance could help it maintain its lead in the streaming landscape.
