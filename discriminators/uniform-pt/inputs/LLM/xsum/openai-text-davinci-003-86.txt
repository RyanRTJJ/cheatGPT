ed positive for coronavirus but have returned negative results for the past seven consecutive days.

Supporters can watch the game live on the Sky Sports red button from 7.45 pm. There will be no fans in attendance at Caledonian Stadium.

The original fixture, which was due to be played on Tuesday, 30 March, was postponed after 13 Hearts players tested positive for coronavirus. The postponement was the club's fourth of the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The fixture list has been thrown into disarray due to the virus, and Hearts will now try to end their season with three games in just nine days. With the match against Motherwell being rescheduled, Hearts' final three fixtures will be: home to Livingston (Saturday, 10 April), away at Motherwell (Tuesday, 12 April) and away at St Johnstone (Saturday, 17 April). 

The match against Motherwell could have a significant impact on the title race, with both sides currently in the hunt for the Scottish Premiership title. Motherwell are currently one point ahead of Rangers in second place, while Hearts sit one point behind Rangers in third place. 

The game could also be crucial in determining whether Hearts can clinch a European spot this season. The Edinburgh side currently sit in fifth place, just four points off Aberdeen in fourth and six points off Motherwell in third.

The rearranged match will provide further hope for Hearts of securing European football next season. The Edinburgh side are acutely aware that the outcome of the Motherwell match could be decisive in the race for Europe.
