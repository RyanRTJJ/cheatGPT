ised the innings at 5-4 in 26 overs, helping their bowlers to record four wickets in as many balls.

Then Clarke was hit on the gloves by Ruchir Sharma (2-24) in his follow-through, which made it 6-4. But for an excellent catch by the short leg, they may have lost. Shikhar Dhawan took the catch, while James Middlebrook (44 off 39 balls) put on some extra work to help his side into position to reach the target.

Clarke, Ben Cox, Ross Whiteley and Ruchir Sharma have been superb as they have given the bowlers more options than just spin bowlers and swing bowlers. They seem to have had the confidence to let their batting power up and keep on the attack.

I think that this is the only match where the bowlers got a chance to get the wickets and they delivered brilliantly. We will see if spinners and seamers had anything to do with England’s victory in this match.
