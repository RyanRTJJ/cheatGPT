) and what they will be called (ie a ‘tax’ or a ‘fee’). It is even possible that as many as three different measures will be announced during the campaign.

In any case, however, any tax or fee on financial transactions is likely to be much lower than those being touted in the past by the big banks and their shills on the political right and left. Since I’ve already documented that all of the recent claims of the big financial services lobby, including Paul Wolfowitz from the big-business-funded World Bank, to the effect of a need to ‘make the rich pay their fair share’ is nothing more than a massive lie, I need not do it here. The big banks and their shills all have their talking points written out in pretty much the same form, making the very same arguments.

Just check out the financial media as it has rolled for the last few years to see who is the most avid shill for the big banks when it comes to all the big bank-spawned financial crises, including the Eurozone’s current crisis, which is by no means over. Most of the media can’t help but to be on the bank team and not on the debtor team. So if the bank lobby wants to claim credit for doing something, anything other than what we’ve all seen them doing, they are not likely to be able to cite many previous occasions. That is not to say they won’t claim that this or that is a necessary step to keep the financial system from collapsing, they will do so even if there’s not a shred of actual evidence to back that claim, but they had better come up with a better case than I’ve documented in my post.

So those who claim to be calling for ‘economic justice’ and ‘fairness for the commoners’ may be called on to explain to the public why they’re proposing a tax of only two or three per cent on stock sales, mutual funds sales, and other financial transactions. When you read into what the banks are calling for, though,
