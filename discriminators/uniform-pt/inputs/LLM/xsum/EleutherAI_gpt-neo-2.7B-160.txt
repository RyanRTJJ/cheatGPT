 by the end of negotiations in 2016. But Mr Clarke said the EU's proposals ran the risk of "unilateral" Brexit, adding that in order to minimise this risk, the UK needed to reach an ambitious trade deal with the rest of the world. If the UK left the EU, it would only continue trading with the remaining 27 member countries. "The problem is, you're going to have to leave the customs union and the single market - both of which are about to give you a lot of regulatory disadvantages," Mr Clarke said. "If you go, you'd be exiting the EU with a trade agreement with the EU and possibly an agreement with the rest of the world. That sounds very attractive, but on the face of it, the risk to you from that seems significant." He added: "If the EU, or indeed an independent Scotland, decided to have a referendum and said, 'We want to negotiate access to the single market because people hate regulations,' then it might make sense to have such regulatory advantages for the UK."

But Mr Clarke said that if the rest of the UK chose to leave the EU on that basis, it would cause huge problems. "All that would be about is getting to a country with a higher per capita income and not as many regulations," he said. He added: "We're not doing this to be a soft brexit, just to avoid a hard brexit." He argued that leaving the EU would improve Britain's relations with its major trading partner and would mean more money was available to invest in the NHS and other public services. He noted that many British companies were now exporting around Â£300bn more products to the rest of the world than they were in 2001. The UK is currently the EU's second largest trading partner, and the US now has a bigger trade deficit with the UK than with the US. Exiting the EU would give Britain more trade with the US following a decision to leave the bloc.
