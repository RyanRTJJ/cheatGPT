 game that you have to teach that is a lot like the kind of sport that you play in high school when you're playing club rugby. It is very good at both attack and defence. It has got some great forwards as well and it is also well built."

The Ireland scrum looks set for a difficult start to this one. As in Friday night's win against France in Munster, it is the centre and number eight pairing which looks weak against the pace and power of Stuart McCloskey's forwards in the opening stages of the game.

After being at pains to praise his team's organisation, and noting that his Irish team are one of the best in world rugby after their first two defeats of the year, Connolly then offered the players advice on what they needed to do in order to improve. They agreed with him.

"We need to make sure we get a better turnover rate and that if our lineouts break down, we can bring them back inside for the attack," explained Ireland's flyhalf Connolly. "On the second phase of play, we need to be able to pass. You cannot run in from the back of our own 19 and you can't pass in."

Now they have mentors like Connolly who will encourage the next generation in their game.
