Some Samsung workers protested by setting off firecrackers and throwing stones at police. A police spokesman said that Samsung’s headquarters in Seoul were evacuated temporarily and the police took down a poster featuring the Samsung logo, saying the company had become “a hotbed of trouble.”

A video posted on the Korean branch of the Internet portal The Korea Post showed women in white coats being escorted outside Samsung’s headquarters by police and forced to stop their car outside the building.

Seo, the executive of Samsung’s global public relations team, denied that Samsung workers opposed the management of the company. He told reporters that Samsung workers had come together in large numbers.

“The employees’ opinions are of no significance, but what makes us decide the fate of the company are the shareholders’ opinions.”

Samsung could face penalties of up to 2 trillion won (US$1.7 billion) if it loses trust from investors and consumers about its corporate social responsibility policies.

The company, which has a market capitalization of $98.2 billion, is being investigated by anti-trust regulators and the country’s securities and exchanges authority. The group is also under a Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission inquiry.

It is also being investigated by a parliamentary regulatory body, the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, which called in August for the merger between the mobile phone unit Samsung Electronics and a unit of South Korea’s No. 2 mobile phone maker SK Telecom to be investigated on suspicion of corporate fraud.

While Samsung Electronics is being investigated, it has denied any wrongdoing and urged South Korea’s regulatory authorities to
