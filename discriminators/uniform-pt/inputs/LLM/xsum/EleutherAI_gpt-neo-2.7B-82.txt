 out the band in June over his inability to perform.

Brown said he had returned from the studio with his "gut feeling" about the band.

"If you've got to have something with the band then you've got to do it and we will either put someone else in the band or we won't put the show on," he told The Hollywood Reporter.

"So the time has come for us to either do it or move on. Everyone should be a little bit angry on what's happened and how things have gone."

In a statement released through his website, Brown said: "The road is long and challenging and we are dealing with all sorts of internal and external issues that have led to some very difficult decisions. The band is not at the point of collapse but we are coming close."

In the meantime, Pink Floyd have issued a statement saying: "We are always humbled, moved and inspired every day by the words and music of those who have passed and are leaving us."

Fellow band member David Gilmour added: "To all the fans who love our music, we offer our deepest condolences and deepest gratitude, and to each of them we offer the unspeakable solace of our unspoken understanding. Thank you for the love and the respect."

Pink Floyd have long maintained a reputation for being difficult to work with, but the musicians were reportedly on good terms, with Gilmour often telling young bands to go out and get their own band.

"That is what everybody says but you don't often hear people saying anything like that at all," Brown told The Hollywood Reporter. "There are a lot of guys out there who are happy to spend a few years at least trying to make a living."
