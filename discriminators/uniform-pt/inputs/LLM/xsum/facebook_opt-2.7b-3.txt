 added that there were fewer releases in 2012 than 2011 – 547 compared with 623 – with half attributed to artists leaving the market after contracts expired. More than half of the new releases were vinyl, with the format selling more than half of all new album releases.

Downloading of music from streaming and download sites rose by 17% to more than 2.4 million on average per week in December, although they accounted for only 3% of the total market in comparison to 12% in 2011, the ERA said.
