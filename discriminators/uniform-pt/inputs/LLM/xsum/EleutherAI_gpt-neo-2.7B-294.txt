 data about the extent of violence, intimidation and other forms of violence to which they say Indigenous women and girls are subjected to.

Nurse Wendy Cuthbert, who has worked in Aboriginal health for more than 20 years, says it is very rare to hear "very violent" language from patients.

"But, more often than not, it's just to say you don't deserve to have the same rights as everyone else," Cuthbert says.

"I've been on the front lines of that violence and abuse. And I look at all three women who recently died on Christmas Island.

"These have been killed by Indigenous peoples, the perpetrators of violence against Indigenous women."

Cuthbert says Indigenous women are the most vulnerable and disadvantaged.

"The trauma that Indigenous women experience is far worse than their non-Indigenous sisters," she says.

"Non-Indigenous women might be better educated, live in more affluent areas and work in occupations that are more well paid.

But Indigenous women are often denied or forced to drop out of school, are often domestic workers, or are forced to work long hours in agricultural and pastoral industries, while Indigenous women and girls, particularly younger ones, often have no work-life balance.

Cuthbert says as nurses and midwives, we too often feel powerless and powerless to change things.

"We know that Indigenous women, specifically those with Aboriginal titles are the most targeted," she says.

"With every census we fill out we are able to see more and more Indigenous women going into the workforce, but we have a lot of targets, but no targets in terms of reducing the rates of violence towards Indigenous women."

The Australian Women's Weekly recently released its annual report on violence against women, calling for urgent action to tackle violence.

It says around 1,000 women a year in Australia are killed or injured in domestic and relationship violence and suicide and self-harm are also on the increase, with 10 percent of young women reporting being bullied.

It says that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women suffered the most, and their violence was largely based on their non-Aboriginal partners' disapproval of Aboriginal status and their Aboriginal cultural practices.
