arriors have not yet named the player and he will only be revealed to supporters if and when he is deemed eligible to play in the Premiership.

Mama, who is eligible for Samoa, is the latest addition to the Warriors squad, after Hook ended his contract with the Clermont Auvergne-based club this summer.

The back row, 24, joined Clermont in 2015 after initially turning out for Montpellier. He has made 36 appearances for Clermont and scored three tries.

The signing of Mama isn't the first time that the Warriors have made a move to bring in a Samoa international. Last season, Samoa international Salesi Ma'afu joined the club as a replacement for All Black Steven Luatua, and he made 24 appearances for the club.

Mama will join a squad which is full of other Samoa internationals, such as David Lemi and Vereniki Goneva.

It is yet to be seen how his arrival will affect the Warriors' dynamic, and whether or not he will be given the chance to start in the back row alongside the likes of Indian-origin players, such as Matt Kvesic and Teimana Harrison.

The Warriors have also made three further signings this summer, bringing in hooker Darren Dawidiuk, scrum-half Jonny Arr and scrum-half George Tresidder. 

It remains to be seen how many more new signings will follow before the start of the season.
