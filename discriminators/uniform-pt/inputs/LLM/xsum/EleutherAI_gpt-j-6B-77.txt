, president of the EISU in Northern Ireland, described the action as “the biggest confrontation yet in the long and bitter dispute”.





The National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) voted to launch a 24-hour campaign of action over pay, jobs and workload on 30 November 2016 to coincide with the second day of industrial action. The decision was taken following a motion tabled in September 2016 by the EISU Executive Board. It was proposed by the executive of the EISU.

The dispute is centred on pay increases but the situation is likely to worsen as the two-year pay-increase deal expires at the end of December and pay rates do not keep pace with inflation.

The EISU Executive Board’s decision comes a few hours after the NASUWT general secretary Christine Blower rejected a proposed extension of a pay deal which will take effect through to the end of January 2017 as being unreasonable.

The pay deal for 2016-17 was negotiated in April and May of this year. The Executive Board proposed the pay increase in August but was rejected by the NASUWT.

The union then moved to a ballot of its members. It is expected to be completed by Christmas.

It must now be ratified by 70 per cent of members in favour by a three-quarters majority.

Members’ pay has been frozen while they were engaged in a lengthy round of collective bargaining with the Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) and the Department of Education (DfE).

However, there is concern that the situation will worsen when the pay deal expires next month and the members may be forced into another round of pay negotiations.

Peter Weir, president of the EISU in Northern Ireland, said: “We are appalled by the decision of the NASUWT to launch this unprecedented industrial action which will disrupt essential teaching processes which is unacceptable.

“The National Executive has a duty to the children of Northern Ireland to see an immediate return to dialogue between the two sides to avoid further disruption of educational services.
