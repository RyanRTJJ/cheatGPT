 who had clinched the gold, did not compete as Ugen was suspended for the final two months of the Rio Games.

"There's no doubt she made our medal fight look easy at Olympic qualifying. I've seen how hard she worked and she'll come into games like this, ready to go," added Ugen. "But at the end of the days, this is a sport where all that work and preparation is paid back with victory. It's just not possible to take your foot off the gas all the time and not feel like you're winning."

At their second try, Johnson-Thompson tried to take advantage of the confusion by pulling up a chainlift, gaining height twice against the heavy resistance of Ugen's 6.78m. Johnson-Thompson then pushed Ugen to gain height once again, which she attempted again under fire from a full-length chain lift.

Johnson-Thompson eventually gave up the lift and took a shot on the rope, while Ugen had a strong reaction against the kick. The former Olympic bronze medalist took another shot on the rope, while Johnson-Thompson responded one more time by grabbing onto Ugen's leg.

At 3:45pm, after a round of throwing and pushing, Ugen and Johnson-Thompson finally gave up their grips.

When the judges confirmed that the second throw was not for a win, Johnson-Thompson then lifted herself a few more times to keep herself from being thrown out of the match.

"She went through so much," said Johnson-Thompson, who added that she was surprised at how fast she was able to maintain her level, which she also described as being "super-human" after just a week. "It's a great experience to be involved, especially after the time that people have made up in the last week."

Telling off her fellow competitors, Johnson-Thompson said she had never seen a fight move more quickly. Not much faster than this match. @PennyBruel pic.twitter.com/4xGmX0c3UE â€” Rio Olympics (@RioOlympics) July 14, 2017
