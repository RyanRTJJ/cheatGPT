 supported by a petition with more than 1.4million signatures, also in support of the rights of gay people.

Hate speech is also banned by the English version of the website and a section of its text states: "All content of this site is of an offensive cultural nature (cissexism, racism, ableism, etc.) and should not be taken seriously."

The article is not supported by any academic, media outlet, political party, business association or any other organization listed on the site's website.

"It's appalling how a country that was founded by a great many homosexuals was transformed by the forces of totalitarianism when the state in itself was forced to redefine and censor certain ideas and portray them in a negative light," said Michael Young, the founder of Free Speech for Charlie. "It's especially worrying now as we enter a time where the state has so often been able and willing to push its own agenda on our rights."

He noted that, since its inception in 2008, the site has led to the censoring of thousands of articles.

The group has begun an online petition against the change.

Charlie Hebdo is a weekly satirical weekly magazine published in Paris, France. The publication of the controversial issues has sparked international controversy and protests, however, French police say they have no plans to crack down on the magazine, according to Reuters. However, a campaign led by the Anti-Fascist Action network, a German umbrella organization, has called on people to join a new online community that is meant to provide safe spaces to people who have faced harassment and violent threats in the past, despite the strict policies of the main French government.

The new initiative, Charlie Hebdo – Don't Let Us Down, launched on Monday, seeks to bring about change through protests – not by the kind that can be triggered by a terrorist attack or other crisis. The website is available on Google's Chrome Web browser.
