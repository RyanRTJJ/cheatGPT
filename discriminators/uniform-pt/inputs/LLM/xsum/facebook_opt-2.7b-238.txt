 It has also ordered the chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, Ian Hopkins, to explain his attitude to the interception of communications. The police are under pressure to explain why they did not seek judicial approval for their surveillance of a criminal network that was said to be operating in and around Manchester.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described police surveillance of phones and premises as "deeply worrying".

Mr Corbyn said he was "angry and shocked" by the information he was learning. He added: "These revelations should make it clear to all of us that the right to privacy is important and we must not let that precious right be eroded any further during this parliamentary session."

Greenwald is one of the journalists to have worked closely with Mr Snowden, revealing government activities that are highly controversial. Earlier this year, Mr Snowden told Mr Corbyn: "Britain is the most sophisticated spying state on Earth."

Greenwald, who was in Moscow last week, told the Guardian the British security services wanted to "destroy" him. In an interview in January, an aide to Mr Snowden said the "vast majority" of the Guardian's journalists were happy with the work they were doing.
