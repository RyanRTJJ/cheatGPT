 custody in April, and police say his injuries eventually forced him to undergo a fatal spinal fusion surgery.

A second suspect, Baltimore resident Freddie Gray - who suffered a head injury, but was immediately airlifted by helicopter to the hospital - also remains on suicide watch. His sister said she hopes he dies.

"I just want my brother alive," Mary Ellen Lunsford said in a video appearance released Thursday, after a family spokeswoman told reporters all nine suspects in Gray's arrest and death had been "neutralized."


"We're hoping to turn things around," she said, speaking over the phone from her home. "I don't need to talk to Freddie."

Gray, 27, was carrying $200 and a cell phone in the back seat of his police SUV on May 31 while he was arrested in the Southwest Baltimore suburb.

After officers ordered Gray to the ground face-down in a police van, he ran for his life but was later pronounced dead by paramedics. His death ignited protests across the nation over the Baltimore police's use of force, violence and disregard for the suspect's rights.


In court documents, police officials initially described his collapse as a "life-threatening incident," and said he was taken to the hospital suffering from a suspected broken neck. Police charged Baltimore state's attorney Marilyn Mosby with seven counts of second-degree murder after charging her with the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter. But the former prosecutor has since argued that her case in Gray's case is stronger because she acted before the arrest and is more credible.

Mosby's case against four of the nine suspects was moved to "substantial evidentiary support," or the preliminary findings of the prosecution, the prosecutors said.
