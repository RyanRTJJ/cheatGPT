 resources for those most in need. And as with many things in Scotland, this is not just a women's issue.

The report makes several specific recommendations in response to the gender pay gap. More could, for example, be done to better encourage women into senior posts. There would also need to be changes to career progression, promotion guidelines and the way women are treated in the workplace more generally.

The gender pay gap is currently around 13%.

"We acknowledge a gender pay gap exists," says the head of the SNP's Women's Equality Board, Christine Elliott. "But we believe that it is being tackled. We're now heading towards a balance situation as there is equal distribution of pay between men and women, not that we will see it to be perfectly equal but certainly closer to balanced or even in many cases closer to that than in the past which is fantastic."

To the BBC's Richard Pohle, it may also be about "the perception of gender roles".

"Women have the primary responsibility to look after the family and the household and it's a very traditional thing," he says, adding that when they lose their jobs in the current austerity climate "because businesses can't cope with that they tend to go into the home and look after the family".

Among the main contributors to the gender pay gap in the UK are men's "continued preference for part-time part-year work". The report suggests this may change now women are joining the workforce: "The longer we are in Scotland the more likely that more men will become more motivated to do part-time or flexible work."

The SNP report also highlights what it believes to be the root of the problem in Scotland - the "unrealistic economic and financial expectations" of many workers.

It points to the fact that Scotland lags behind England when it comes to the proportion of the workforce in paid jobs and it also looks at the problem of "the poor standard of the quality of housing and poor food".

Dr Jane Buchanan, from policy think-tank Policy Connect, told the programme this is "likely to be why women are generally not taking on new roles as high-status
