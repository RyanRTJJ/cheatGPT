 is unknown whether this was discovered before, or by the current version of Windows 7.

The vulnerability is only exploited in Microsoft Windows 7 Professional on systems running Windows Vista. You must set up or manage the computer to enable the vulnerability, but disabling the feature does not allow you to use Windows 10.

H/T: Microsoft [Update 16-11-10] and Microsoft TechNet

Disclosure: This post was first published by TechNet in June of this year for the post "Microsoft Hacks Open Source Linux in Windows 7 and 2012." I am most definitely not the first to write about security vulnerabilities in Linux. If you like my blogs, follow me on Twitter, and read my other writing at TechNet.

UPDATE 16-11-10: As of 8/14/14, Microsoft said it is no longer aware of a non-security vulnerability in Linux. It is just that it is still investigating and reporting the patch and fixes.

If you are a Linux user or do not use this software, check out these resources if you wish to find more interesting security vulnerabilities for Windows.

UPDATE 16-11-10: While this post has been corrected to reflect "H/T: Microsoft" rather than "Microsoft," readers should follow the latest update on the topic by following Microsoft on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms.
