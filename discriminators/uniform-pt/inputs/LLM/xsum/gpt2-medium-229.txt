 out a few people on a boat. One of their favourite things was picking up rubbish on the river.

I met them over 15 years ago as I was finishing up my undergraduate studies. My goal was to help them complete their degree. I was the only person they asked to join 'The House'. The aim was to start their own organisation to help those who've left their country and the world behind. They asked if I'd look after them and then started work on 'The House' to help out. From working with them I have learned their family values and I can see how grateful they are and are always trying to make things better with everyone. It has been an honour, as I had my eye on a position here, and to know them.

I could see how much support they had at university, and the fact that I had to choose them to attend school here. The fact that they've grown up together after 40 years and I can see how they have given back, is another thing that I can be thankful for. For me this has been a wonderful feeling!

I would like to thank everyone for your support and help in getting them back together. I know they have a really tough time, as I had to tell them I'd miss them. They're still very young, they need me to look after them, and I'll have all the energy to try and push forward with the organisation.

To all my friends @TheHouse @Cork_City & a huge thanks to all @Cork_City citizens - the response to the petition has been enormous, helping to get them back on their feet. It's now been over three thousand signatures and they're back to using Twitter and facebook to support them. Thanks again and I appreciate you all giving them the support they need. #TheHouseIsAllAboutThePeople #Chernobyl

I'd like to wish the family happiness and happiness for what's to come. I can't thank
