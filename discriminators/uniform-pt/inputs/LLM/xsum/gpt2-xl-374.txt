 Naiyaravoro, who scored in each of his two appearances on the tour last season, also scored for Samoa in Auckland.

Warriors skipper Ken Maumalo, who was making his first start in the tournament, said the visitors' effort was "absolutely outstanding". "The boys have really put together a great game plan on defence, and are using our skills and skills that we have, which is really exciting," Maumalo said after the match. "We know that they are a talented team, but it was about our performance today."

Futah's Ben O'Keeffe scored two tries, but this was not his first run in a Warriors shirt. The 27-year-old made his Warriors Super League debut in 2010, but was released by them in 2012 and has since been playing in Super Rugby for Auckland, Crusaders and Rebels. "It's a tremendous privilege to play for such a top rugby league team like the Wellington Panthers at such a critical juncture of my career. To be able to represent my home city and play in such historic games and to be in this position is incredible," he said. "This is such an opportunity for me to show the people of New Zealand what a top professional rugby league player can do and for me personally, it will be a huge honour." The Warriors won the first Test in Christchurch and followed up the victory by scoring 22 points in the second Test in Dunedin last weekend. The Crusaders, who won the first of their three Tests against Samoa in Auckland, won the last Test against the same opponents a year ago. The NZ Warriors will take on the South Africans on Friday at Eden Park. Watch Super League Live on Sky Sports here Â»
