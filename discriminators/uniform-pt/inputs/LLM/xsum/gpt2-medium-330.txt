 construction industry was up slightly.

The picture is largely unchanged from December, the survey found.

The ONS said that activity in the construction sector contributed a small, yet reliable, share of overall growth. It also showed robust exports.

Meanwhile, the number of unemployed workers rose in November and is on its fourth month of jobless joblessness.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said: "The Labour Force Survey provides one of the key measures of the economy by revealing trends and statistics around the nation's working and consumer.

"This is used to give more detailed and detailed estimates of the number of people actively looking for work and, more often, which are the most likely to be jobseeker by virtue of their occupations or income.

It is also used to provide quarterly breakdowns of employment and unemployment.

"In the month to September, 2,836,000 people were working in the private sector; 3,852,000 people were self-employed; and 1,915,000 were unemployed.

"However, the share of all employment growth registered over this month is lower than the trend recorded for the same month last year.

"While growth in private part-time and part-time work has been strong on a monthly basis this year (and still up), it is low in the trend recorded last year and well below the trend recorded in 2011-12 (2.1% for February, and 4.9% for December)."

But the ONS said that there were signs the recovery could be growing faster than it has so far in this long-running recovery, because of the increased number of people looking for work.

Mr Hammond announced on Monday that the government would raise income tax the tax band from £7,000 to £10,000 for the first time to increase the lowest earners' rate from 20% to 26%.

Tax credits - particularly those on energy, transport and appliance - will be indexed to rises in inflation. The increase was proposed by George Osborne in 2013.

Other measures include abolishing the stamp duty free allowance or the tax relief
