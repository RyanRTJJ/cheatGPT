ngenta all seeking to acquire Monsanto. But an analysis of the U.S. agriculture industry reveals that farmers around the country don’t view Monsanto as the best fit for their operations.

In this study, researchers at Georgia State University examined three sets of data covering both crop yields and the incomes of farmers in 15 states. They compared three groups:

Farmers who applied Roundup Ready cotton

Farmers who applied glyphosate-resistant crops such as soybeans plus Monsanto’s herbicide Glyphosate-resistance trait

Farmers who applied only Roundup Ready cotton

Farmers who applied only Roundup Ready beans

In fact, there was not a significant difference between the yield or overall earnings of farmers who planted Roundup Ready cotton and those who planted just Roundup Ready cotton. (That’s because Roundup Ready cotton is also used for other crops, such as field corn, wheat and canola. For that reason, the overall mix of crops farmers chose also appeared to affect how farmers earned money.)

For those farmers who planted glyphosate-resistant crops that also had a Monsanto herbicide trait, on the other hand, farmers benefited significantly from cultivating those crops: Yields of glyphosate-resistant crops spiked significantly when they were planted alongside Monsanto herbicides—even beyond farmers’ expectations. While glyphosate-resistance crops cost more to buy than their more traditional counterparts, farmers’ incomes also increased markedly when planting glyphosate-resistant crops.

These findings are especially relevant because, as in past years, farmers have come upon low prices for their crops. In fact, many farmers aren’t receiving the profit they expected and as a result, Monsanto has faced a significant amount of political pressure. Most U.S. farmers have been forced to accept Monsanto’s genetically modified seed, which has come with its own set of problems, such as water contamination and unintended environmental damage. Monsanto is also facing lawsuits from those harmed by its genetically modified crops. Now, lawmakers from across the country are threatening to introduce legislation that would bar federal agencies from purchasing genetically modified seeds from Monsanto.
