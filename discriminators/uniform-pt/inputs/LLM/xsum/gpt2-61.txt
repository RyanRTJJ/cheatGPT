 believed he was not bound to a particular topic.

A spokesman for Mr Papilai said Mr Papilai had a client who was "very angry" about any criticism.

"It was a very, very angry client," he said. "He had been doing nothing wrong and when we spoke it was a completely normal customer."

Police were asked to stop their interviews until they met with Mr Papilai.

They are questioning about the possible links of other people to the Sudanese government, including at least two former US diplomats. The arrest comes seven weeks after Washington sent a team of US diplomats to Sudan, accused of helping smuggle US weapons and human rights abuses, to Egypt to meet with Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Cairo.

The US secretary of state, John Kerry, and senior Western military commanders have urged Mr Papilai's extradition and said they want to know if the alleged connections are true.

The UK Foreign Office and the UK ambassador to Sudan, Christopher Stevens, have appealed for any information they have about the case to turn over.

"He is a man who has not even been charged or indicted. And as far as I can tell it does not exist," said Mr Stevens. "We are not in a hurry for it to be closed down when that is what the authorities need or if they want to go back on the case in order to have the last word.

"So there is no other thing for us to do in a moment of urgency. Once we have that we will let them live with it and we have nothing to show."

Britain, France and Jordan have been involved in the investigation.

Kirsan Ilyumzhin, then the director of Middle East Security Policy at the New York Times who is currently a consultant at a consultancy that advises the British and American war powers in Africa and the Middle East, said: "The US is clearly the biggest contributor to the problem in Sudan, with at least $400m a year in covert aid".

US officials have denied the claims, and the two embassies in Sudan have urged its return.

It is unclear how the US investigation will play out.
