killer The Incredibles this year.

The main event, the world's fifth biggest cheese festival where contestants were chosen for what was to be their best cheese, opened in Berlin on Friday night.

The event drew almost 815,000 people during weekend days.

The festival's theme went into a frenzy last weekend after Mr Schmoller's comments about the "cursed snowman" who could never be forgiven by humanity.

The German cheese factory chain Cigna, which has become an official food sponsor for several companies such as Cigna UK, has said it will not sell any cheese from an Australian cheese roll.

But Mr Schmoller went further: "I am of the view that if it is a case of the cursed snowman, then we should be celebrating cheese with our colleagues in Austria.

"If it is only us, then a great cheese event will not happen any more. This is my view on this."

As well as the official cheeses, some were brought from the US and Germany and received international sponsorship by various governments and other companies such as Nike Inc and BMW.

Cigna said it "reaffirms that no international company sponsoring cheese should accept cheese or dairy products brought from a country where cheese manufacturing is highly regulated and under-monitored".

"While we welcome these efforts, it is not the case that cheese and cheeses are inherently harmful to human health. Rather than creating new opportunities for business and consumption, both cheese and cheese products are good products to bring our customers around the world," spokeswoman Helmut Schulze told the Telegraph.

"In addition to a new cheese business model, we believe that it is right to offer cheese as a new and complimentary snack of pleasure.
