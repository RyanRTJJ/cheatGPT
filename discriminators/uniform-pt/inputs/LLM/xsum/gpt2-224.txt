They say the incident is all too familiar.

Neighbourhood resident Steve McLean said he had not heard anything during the chaos before it happened.

"When the incident happened I was worried for my family and friends as the building got up, but it appears to have stopped, my children came to my door. Two of my four older children were in it, and at least six men were inside," he said.

A friend of the couple has been notified and will contact police to talk about what may have happened at home.
