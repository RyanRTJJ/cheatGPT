Cycling events have been cancelled by the British Cycling in the north and west because of high winds and more warnings for wind on Monday. Organisers have encouraged cyclists to postpone their rides because of the risk of serious injury or damage to property.

The British Cycling event in Sheffield, the first in the UK to go ahead this year, has been called off although some riders have already cancelled their plans.

Police in Sheffield urged cyclists to postpone rides while the Met Office warned that more damaging winds are expected to take effect on Monday.

Chard was cycling through the Derbyshire town of Ilkeston when he suffered a cardiac arrest on Sunday, one of 20 fatalities on the day. He was taken to hospital, but died a short time later, Nottinghamshire police said. He is said to have been a regular attendee of the Derbyshire events.

Thames Valley police have also appealed for cyclists to postpone rides and asked organisers to cancel events until conditions improve.

The Cycling Association said: "It is likely that the majority if not all of tomorrow's events will now be cancelled."
