 major international lending initiative sponsored by GCU at school level, but it is also the first university to offer mortgages at school levels, and the first of its kind in the UK, in the hope that they will help to facilitate access to housing and early education for disadvantaged students.

The initiative has brought together local councils, students and individuals, to launch a pilot and, through community involvement, have set up an all-volunteer programme of loans to provide early childhood education in five main settings and four schools. The scheme now supports 16,000 students across 17,000 schools across Glasgow.

The consortium, funded by Scotland's top financial institutions, aims to increase the investment in early childhood education between £200m and £500m over four years. The project aims to address a crucial problem: the impact of the housing shortage on early childhood development that has been compounded by the rapidly ageing population of disadvantaged teenagers and older people.

Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) has provided £27m of financing in the next nine years as the school offers loans to school children across three cities, in particular Glasgow. GCU's pilot and support programme is expected to bring in around £10m. The first of this scale is set to expand to Glasgow in October.

"The Scottish Government understands that the needs of its pupils at GCU are urgent and the first steps to meet that need have to be undertaken immediately to build momentum for the project," said Prof Alun Doyle, Chief Executive Officer, GCU. "The key for achieving our key targets is the opportunity to deliver affordable, quality early childhood care, enabling students to improve their lives.

"We plan to deliver this next step for the first time in less than three years, by introducing an innovative lending framework and ensuring that the funds raised are used to provide early childhood support to disadvantaged young people and young families who need it most in their lives."

Professor Doyle said: "This pilot also
