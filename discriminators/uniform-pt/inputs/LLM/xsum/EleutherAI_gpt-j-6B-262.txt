 video, I didn't take into consideration that I was promoting multiple singles at the same time," she told The Sun. "It's not that I didn't care, just that I didn't think about it. I want to say sorry to my fans and to my team [who had] to work long hours to get this video done."

She added: "I'm not an idiot. I'm quite experienced with work and I know what my deadlines are and I have a good team. I could have been more careful, I get that.

"In three weeks the new album is due and in all my videos I try to explain the meanings in a simple way...It is hard work with my team and I want to say sorry to them. I really want to finish the projects on time."

As for who may be joining the new girl group, Halsey was coy, but it seems like someone is almost certainly going to leave Stitches. "I don't care," she told Cosmo. "My friends think I'm going to be crazy. Because I keep talking about [Stitches]." She continued: "I will have more to say about it, but I can't for now."

In a video posted to her social media earlier this week, Halsey hinted that the new group is ready to launch. "I want to do it with my friends," the star said, "I'm gonna get it all ready. I don't know when, but I know one day, I'm really gonna do a thing like this."

Halsey made her debut as a musical artist in 2013 and was the winner of the 2015 edition of the Best New Artist Grammy in the category of pop solo performance. The singer recently released a second single, Alone, which is taken from her forthcoming sophomore studio album. Its B-side, the ballad Can't Hurt Me Now, was released on March 14.
