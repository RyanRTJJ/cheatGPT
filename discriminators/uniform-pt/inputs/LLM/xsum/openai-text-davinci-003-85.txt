ations in the Mediterranean should continue, either through Sofia or another mechanism.

Critics of Sophia have argued that the mission has failed to achieve its aims, with human traffickers and smugglers continuing to operate, migrants continuing to come to Europe and the EU member states disagreeing on how to manage their external borders.

However, while some have suggested the mission should be abandoned, those in favour argue that it reduces the number of deaths at sea by providing a dedicated search and rescue platform. They also believe that it is a valuable opportunity to gather intelligence on the activities of smugglers and traffickers.

The European Commission and EU member states are currently considering whether to renew Sophia’s mandate, which expires in March 2020. 

If Sophia’s mandate is not renewed, the European Commission points out that no other mission currently exists that offers similar capabilities, and that search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean would be carried out by other naval vessels, aircraft and emergency services. It is also argued that dismantling Sophia could weaken the intelligence capabilities of European governments to identify and disrupt smuggling networks in the Mediterranean.

Overall, while others have questioned the effectiveness of the Sophia mission, it is important to recognize the potential benefits that it could offer, such as saving lives and disrupting smuggling networks. Renewing the mission will require an agreement between all European countries on the best approach to manage their external borders, but this may be the best way to prevent further deaths in the Mediterranean due to human trafficking.
