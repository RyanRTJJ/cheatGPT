hot in the chest in Connah's Quay, North Wales, in August 2018.

Roberts, who had driven Munkley to the scene of the killing, said he witnessed the shooting. He said he saw Munkley, 41, fire the shotgun at Mr Davies, who had been sitting in the front passenger seat of his car. 

Roberts said he then heard Munkley say "You've got what you deserved". Roberts said he then heard Munkley talk about the debt that had caused the argument between the two of them. 

Munkley, of Flint, has admitted manslaughter but denies murder. The trial continues.
