ber 1986 and farmers on the Welsh coast were variously advised to avoid milking sheep, to separate lambs from their mothers and to put pregnant ewes inside stables. The UK government only admitted the extent of the contamination in 2011. 

The contamination caused by the Chernobyl disaster was highly acute and had many environmental and health risks in the areas surrounding the area. To combat these, safety measures were imposed throughout western Europe, including restrictions on the sale of some products (such as sheep’s milk and sheep's meat). In the UK, sheep farmers in Wales were impacted the most, being advised to limit their animals grazing outside and separate lambs from their mothers. 

The UK government’s response to the Chernobyl disaster was criticized for its slow response in disclosing the radiation levels of the area that were induced by the disaster. Furthermore, the government had failed to provide clear guidance or updates to the farmers regarding the clean-up of the area and testing of the contaminated sheep’s milk. 

The long-term implications of the Chernobyl disaster on the local environment, human populations, and farming practices are still being felt. Despite the long-term effects of the fallout beginning to become more apparent, the community in Wales continues to face an uncertain future due to the lack of information from the government. Fears have been expressed that the government has still not properly acknowledged the extent of the contamination.
