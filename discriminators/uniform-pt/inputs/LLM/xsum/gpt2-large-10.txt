 started by summer 2017.

And transport experts have warned that the government could be creating the conditions for a train operator to take over Edinburgh's services.

The new Scottish Government is expected to give its backing for the study next week and it is thought that in December, Transport Minister Humza Yousaf will announce the winner, although any deal should be in place by January.

Mr Yousaf has suggested the study - which will look at broader issues including the number of routes being developed or lost - which could have a knock-on effect on services from Glasgow airport.

Mr Yousaf said: "In the event that the results of the study are used in discussions with potential operators a timetable for this will be set out by the government.

"At that point, a proposal for a timetable and service strategy for the route could be made."

There are three possibilities in which railways could enter the picture - a new railway operator, and the private sector.

But with private companies already struggling to replace a number of parts of the Southern rail network, it is thought the competition could provide a new voice to the rail industry.

The Scottish government appears to be planning a major new overhaul of Scotland's railways, in a bid to give customers more choice and less congestion.

It wants to give more investment and power to the private sector and it wants to give the railways the capacity to be better run, so they run better. But it also has a real interest in getting a new rail operator in place before it can make significant progress in improving the quality of trains.

In theory Mr Yousaf's report offers rail travellers a choice.

Which train company should they want? The short answer is the first person to present a solution to the problem of how they will access the new railway service will win the contract with the public purse.

The public is unlikely to think that's a good thing.

So in the months ahead, the government faces one of its biggest challenges.
