 the party's Conference today. His speech was not well-received by delegates. Among those delegates who left were two MPs and former leadership contenders Ed Miliband and Yvette Cooper. Mr Miliband and others said Lord Kinnock's comments reflected on the "political maturity" they had witnessed between 1997 and 2010. Gordon Brown, seen by many as the party's greatest leader, was accused of failing the nation in the last Labour administration and he was also booed. Lord Kinnock said he had been accused of wanting to see everyone in the party "crammed into the Blairite bunker". Lord Kinnock, a former defence secretary, said it was not his intention to stir up bitterness. He said of Mr Miliband: "Ed hasn't learnt from past experience. "Ed will learn from history, and he will change." He added about Mr Brown: "Gordon has made mistakes but he is the best of all of us. "The other thing I would say about Gordon is that he had a huge amount to be proud of in that last Labour government." The comments come at a difficult time for the Labour Party and after a week of public embarrassment over Labour members attending a rally organised by far-right think tanks. The controversial Labour Campaign for Free Speech said more than 300 people attended, and organisers said it was a demonstration of the party's "broad support for free speech and democracy". Speaking at the conference, Lord Kinnock also questioned how the Labour Party had performed in elections under Ed Miliband. Lord Kinnock told delegates: "I am not a man of bitterness, which says something about how the Labour Party is viewed and not as the media sometimes would have us believe, but it will not be good for the Labour Party just to close off our membership."
