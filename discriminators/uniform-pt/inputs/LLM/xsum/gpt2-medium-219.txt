 funding have proved elusive, however. The council's financial sustainability plan will publish in February 2013, and the first half of the second financial year was almost £25m below last year's forecast – prompting the council to issue additional funding to meet the gap until after the budget in March 2013.

That will see the number of council jobs increase by around 50, and the number of temporary staff slashed by around a third.

But council officials argue that the biggest job cut will come in the "services area", as temporary employees are split between a number of council services. Some new, lower level jobs in the "service area" might come from a new "programmes" initiative, and these will bring down the number of council jobs by 100.

The chief executive of the centre, which works in the "service area" to ensure that services are available to those who need them, was particularly optimistic. "The first phase of this new model will offer an initial boost to staff productivity and we are working to scale up the scheme," John Fidler said. "It is very promising that the services area will deliver much higher levels of activity for many years to come. This will enable those staff who get a chance to take time out to look for work in a real and exciting way as more and more people look for jobs."

Fidler also claimed that the new initiative would enable staff to "work into the evening" – a development he explained would only increase staff productivity by a factor of five. In another announcement, a report commissioned by the council said that "the new model of temporary staff brings us closer to the benefits and stability that everyone should expect and aspire to from council as the economy slowly recovers but service levels are still at or near record heights."

A spokesman for the government said last night: "Councils are committed to increasing workforce numbers and building a modern council
