 also due to a shift from "smaller scale, often hand-operated outlets" to "shopper-friendly outlets".

The firm's claim against Tesco in its claims against the company is that Tesco told its workforce about the changes in December, when it introduced a new standard for staff and their shifts.

"In October 2012 Tesco changed the way that it operated its own operations," the firm said. "The effect of this was to reduce the number of staff it employed and their average wage so that they were not making the same as before."

Scott and Scott also said Tesco failed to tell its workforce about the changes by February of this year.
