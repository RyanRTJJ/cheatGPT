a's Umaliwa constituency.

The police chief said the "bizarre" acts will be investigated.

"They do not appear to pose threats to the public's safety. They have been circulating in Kimusu, home to Prime Minister and presidential contender Raila Odinga's Umaliwa constituency and the police is looking at these pictures to ascertain if any action should be taken," the police chief said.

Police in Kimusu, who are already investigating other "unexplained circumstances", are investigating if they circulate in order to cause outrage over their appearance to people who may be sympathetic to the opposition candidate.

"If the police believe any of these incidents to be related to the Raila campaign in Kimusu, the investigation will be completed, and appropriate measures taken," the police chief said.

A police spokesman said the pictures shown in the incident had been removed but confirmed that the circulation of the cartoons had been a "one-time occurrence".

The pictures reportedly showed Odinga in a headscarf in the nude.

Odinga has said he will not campaign if he does not receive an improved offer on his $300,000 (200,000 euros) parliamentary mandate. He made more than 15 visits to Kimusu since his election to the presidency.

Sources inside Odinga's campaign in Kimusu said they knew about the "bizarre pictures circulating on social media". They said the images are "disrespectful to Odinga and to his campaign".

They said they had spoken with members of the public and police who confirmed the circulation of the cartoon images in Kimusu.

"The circulation is disrespected to my people and the people who voted for me. That's what they said - people who came from Kimusho to see Odinga, who have nothing to do with his campaign.

"They just want to see him as a person, human being, not as a symbol. They don't understand such a picture can't be seen as anything, just as he is, a human being."
