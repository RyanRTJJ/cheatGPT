 Crawford won WBA belt after Indongo (27-1-1) failed to make the WBA mandatory defence against IBF champion Carl Froch in a rematch held in Las Vegas. Crawford, 32, became the first IBF champ to successfully defend his title. Indongo was down on the score cards in the previous IBF defence in August, when he lost on an unanimous decision to Froch. The WBO belt did not change hands, as Indongo has not successfully defended title since he took the belt from WBA champion Ricky Hatton in 2008. "Now Carl Froch has no reason to fight anyone," said Hatton in the ring. "It's a shame when people are scared to come fight Ricky Hatton because of what he thinks Carl Froch is capable of doing."

Froch has won two belts since beating Hatton in November 2008 and will move up to 147 lbs if he wins. The IBF order was vacated when Hatton relinquished his title, but Froch was not initially included in the match. The WBO ordered Froch to face IBF challenger Lucian Bute in early December - a fight Bute (24-1) is to take on Froch on Jan. 19 in Montreal. Bute's promoter, Top Rank Chairman Bob Arum, believes Froch (33-1-2) has no reason to risk losing a fourth belt. "I'm sure Bute will beat (Indongo) but Froch doesn't show his best when he makes the trip out to Canada," said Arum on Tuesday, when Bute's new-old trainer Freddie Roach was unable to attend a card. Hatton said he would take a fight with the 37-year-old Froch, even if Roach was not involved. "He's still one of the hardest punchers I've faced, and he's been beaten once by a boxer who was not even at their best,
