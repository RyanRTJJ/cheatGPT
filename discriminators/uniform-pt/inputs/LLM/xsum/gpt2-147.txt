 urged the Government to "help" people find more healthy ways to drink, smoke, gamble and exercise rather than driving their cars and using social media to promote public health.

And while British citizens will not be forced to smoke as much as others in England, doctors will be forced to make "positive decisions and do things with their bodies" â€“ and that can be difficult, as this is not an "affecting health-care system". This includes making sure that those in need can get help from their GP.

The government also has to focus on educating people on what does and does not cause cancer by presenting them with an assessment, making sure they can safely get help with their diabetes and weight loss, and also helping them exercise more, or getting on holiday or at a beach.

"If anyone can be sure of whether that's the right way to go, but is not going to affect everyone else's mental health, then we need to take that to the next level," Dr Sisem al-Ghali, director of the British Medical Association's Clinical Practice Group for diabetes, told the BBC.

Dr Bahaad Zayed, chairman of the public consultation committee, said the government had made "significant efforts" to address the issue. "The only thing that we've seen so far is some of the same people who are taking their own lives trying to do the wrong thing, making sure that they are at home and get a healthy lifestyle."

Meanwhile, some of the patients in the Royal College of Physicians's Global Health Survey suggest the lack of comprehensive health checks "won't happen by the time you're 30" and others feel they will have to deal with "a health insurance scheme that only lasts 10 years".

The NHS says the UK Government is still "predicting" how long it will take to take full control over the NHS, and it wants to "continue working towards a health system that works for all British families, including those of children and individuals".
