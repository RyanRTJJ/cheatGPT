Former Bath, RGC 12, Wasps and Gloucester flanker John Davies said his career as a rugby player is now ending after the injury he sustained on last season's World Series.

The 32-year-old was playing at the time for Cardiff Blues after his deal came to an end with the Lions.

Davies, who was named in the All Blacks' squad that toured Australia last year, said: "From the moment I arrived and saw what the guys had achieved in the last seven years, I knew that my future was over.

"I didn't know how good I could get, but for that I had an opportunity and the opportunity was gone. I couldn't believe it when the phone rang."

Davies, who said he did not know his final club when he signed last July, also signed on a six-year contract with Leicester Tigers when he said: "I'd had a pretty good life and now it was time to move on.

"I'm not sure what I'll do next, I don't know what I'm going to do. I guess I will look at the Lions if they do something with me. I know the Lions will have to wait and I've just got to move on with my life."

Former Wales hooker James Hook, 30, who played 12 times for Cardiff, signed for Edinburgh in March as they prepare to take on Bath in the British and Irish Lions series in September.

"It was an incredible time for Leeds, a fantastic club but we all put it behind us in the last 21 months. I went in on a fantastic contract and it helped us keep it alive," said Hook.

"The club had a great environment, we've come here because the manager thinks in the future the player is going to be at this place
