 last-four meeting against Ireland.

Both sides set out to win the series at Wembley, which was a place previously only visited by England on only one occasion in a 20-year history. England won the opening game 4–0, the win coming after a mistake by Scotland’s goalkeeper, Allan McGregor, that resulted in a late leveller to the visitors.

In the return game, England were ahead courtesy of a last-minute goal by David Pegg. But in the fourth minute of injury time, Ireland equalised but were unable to score any more before the final whistle.

Ireland’s record was improved by beating Northern Ireland 4–0 at Lansdowne Road in the third match.

Sampson and his players were frustrated at the way their record had been achieved. “The one thing is to get results at all levels and on all continents,” said Sampson after England’s defeat to Ireland at Wembley.

“At senior level, we are the old teams, and we have to keep changing in order to go the next level.” Sampson said he was hoping that his side would be able to return after the summer break and do it again.

“No, I’m not happy about it, because we have to go. If we could have played this year, we would have done,” he said after the 2–2 draw against France. “We have to look back and see what worked out and what could have been. We can’t go on winning the way we have done, and I don’t feel happy about it. The important thing is that we have had an enjoyable season so far.”

Sampson has often stressed how his side has been influenced by the players he has inherited from former manager Harry Redknapp. One of Redknapp’s first acts after taking over from Kevin Keegan was to bring in John Barnes, who Sampson describes as “an inspirational figure”.
