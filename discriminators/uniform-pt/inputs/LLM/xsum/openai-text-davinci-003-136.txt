-mobilization process monitored by the United Nations. The entire process of integration of Farc fighters into civilian life is expected to be completed by April 2017.

The peace deal follows four years of negotiations that ended with a ceasefire in May 2016. The deal marks the formal ending of a guerrilla war which has caused some 220,000 deaths and displaced millions of Colombians. 

During the process, Farc fighters will hand in their weapons to be destroyed in the presence of UN observers. They will then start the process of reintegration into civilian life. Colombia's government has vowed to give combatants access to education and job opportunities. For the next two years, former fighters will receive aid from the government to help them in their new lives. 

The accord also includes a plan for rural reform, to ensure landless rural Colombians access to land and improved living standards. This includes a special tribunal to prosecute human rights violators, as well as compensation for victims of the conflict. 

The deal still faces some minor stumbling blocks, including a referendum that needs to be held in October to approve the accord. But if it is approved, the country could finally move on from a prolonged and brutal civil conflict and start a new chapter in its history.
