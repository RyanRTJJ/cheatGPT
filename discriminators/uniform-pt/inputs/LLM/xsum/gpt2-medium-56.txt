Catholic pupils in the school may pay to travel by car to schools without such pass.

The bus pass can be purchased in a book (e.g. Groomed: A Catholic Schools Directory- Book 3) and signed by the Bishop of Flint. In addition to this, parents paying £1 a year can also be notified about the free pass to families who apply online.

Some schools have made a "no tickets required" offer, whereby parents paying £7.50 a month for their pupil will need to contact their local local school to receive a car registration for their child. Alternatively, pupils are encouraged to keep an eye on their school and let staff know where they are, however this does not offer a full ticket card.

However, parents with a car can pick up their kids at the school after school or if they attend a friend's school for a short week or two and they go off to school from there. However this may be a risk if one parent is visiting the house with a car and leaving it in the garage.

Children should be allowed back in their homes with their parents on their first full school day after 7 am unless there are some exceptional circumstances that cannot be rectified on their first day, such as a visit to GP surgery, injury or illness requiring immediate hospital treatment.

All school children in Flint are welcome in schools except:

for pupils attending any secondary school or college

for pupils attending a special needs school for one year or more

for pupils aged 5 to 11

for pupils of pupils under 5 who are unable to attend normal school with help after lunch time or on short breaks and for parents or other guardians
