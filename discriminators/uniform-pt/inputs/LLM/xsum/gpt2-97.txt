Earlier in March, the Post reported that the alleged victim died in hospital after suffering a concussion. The police confirmed the death: "Detectives have interviewed the woman, who has confirmed she suffered a concussion on Thursday night at a party at an Ottawa hotel in the days leading up to the sexual assault. Police say that's the most likely cause. No charges were ever brought against her."

The women who reported the alleged assault declined to comment. A CBC News spokesperson said Ottawa police are not investigating because of privacy issues.

The Post report was published on Thursday evening, and was accompanied by a statement by the New South Wales Police Service.

"Officers are investigating an alleged sexual assault on Saturday night by a 21-year-old woman on the Upper Main Street area of Vancouver, Victoria. In this case, the woman came from behind and allegedly assaulted the alleged aggressor before assaulting him with a glass of wine, and when she was able to get free of the man she struck him in the groin with a glass of wine," it said.

"It would appear that this was an act of domestic violence and a sex act."

The woman was booked into hospital, and police are asking people to stay away from public places for at least 120 days.

Police said there have been several reports of assaults on public places during the past year, many of them involving women.

In January, CBC News published an extended report that described the victim as "a bright, young, attractive 19-year-old from Ottawa-Oleksie who spoke in a very relaxed voice but seemed content to chat with a group of around 20 mostly male friends. She came to Ottawa from Washington, D.C. her parents and sister went on to attend UBC's Women's and Gender Studies group and her mother was in a private home with a partner."
