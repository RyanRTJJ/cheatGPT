verness and Portsoy battled the blaze for around six hours before leaving the scene shortly after 10am.

John Stewart, chief fire officer at Johnshaven Fire Station, said: "The crews did a really good job of bringing this incident to a successful conclusion.

"We were on the scene from around 3am. The vessel had been towed away from the harbour around 4am, leaving them vulnerable to be attacked by strong winds.

"The vessel, which is named the Reaper, is one of the more unusual vessels still operating in the north-east and had actually been lying anchored overnight with a barge anchored alongside at the harbour.

"It is normally at Dunoon, but it was still being towed out after being in port for Christmas."

Two crews from Inverness were sent to the scene initially, with other crews from Johnshaven, Portsoy and Caithness remaining on site throughout the day.

The vessel caught fire around 4am after being hit by strong winds coming from the west.

Mr Stewart added: "We had to fight the blaze with one engine and one hose pipe.

"We had another crew waiting nearby which helped put out the fire overnight before it was cleared."

A woman on the barge, who is also from the north-east, was assessed by paramedics at the scene and was then treated in hospital.

A spokesman for Inverness Coastguard said: "The incident was deemed very dangerous to our response team.

"The crew from Inverness were asked to prepare to leave the place by harbour lifeboats, which is not something we do all that often."

However, the crew were left with a positive attitude.

He said: "The Harbour Master gave them a hand going into the harbour and some people cheered in the harbour when they got there."

A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.
