 11 points.


Barcelona - who have taken 11 points from 11 games, including a 4-0 win over rivals Real Madrid at Nou Camp - are in a great position after three games in a row, not that they will need it. Atletico should have nothing to worry about on Sunday on their travels, while Bayern Munich will have the last laugh as well after getting the better of their rivals last week at the Nou Camp.

Bayern - which will have the last laugh after losing 2-1 at home to Real Sociedad - will look at the games on Wednesday and Thursday afternoon, especially against Atletico who are playing their first game from March 23, but for the moment Bayern are confident as they will have rested players including the key striker Thomas Muller. Bayern are currently in second position after three games, but will want Bayern to perform.

Madrid have the first game of the month to sort out after losing 2-0 at home to Atletico, while Atletico have two games to think about before facing Barcelona. Atletico have had the better of things so far but Madrid have outscored Atletico 35-24 after 17 games and are the only team to have won three games in a row at the Nou Camp. It's all due to Lionel Messi scoring more goals than anyone else this season. Barcelona will need their star striker Lionel Messi to hit double figures to keep them up and if they do then Madrid will have a nightmare week.

The game also promises to be a big test of the Spanish and European football teams in terms of talent and physical physicality in the Champions League. Bayern and Atletico will find chances to play with their best but the strength of teams can come from teams with an abundance of talent who are also capable of holding their own.


Real Madrid may have just outclassed
