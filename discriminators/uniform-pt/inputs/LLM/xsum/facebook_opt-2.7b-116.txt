 event – with one going all the way from London to Wales. Speaking to ITV Wales, Mr Davies said "cycling for sport is one thing, but not cycling for sport”.

He also told Channel 5: “I cannot understand why we are building an event around sport which is the worst form of pollution. Cycling, although clean, isn’t clean enough when you have cyclists flying up to 40mph through communities.”

The event was originally due to take place in Newport after organisers were given the thumbs up by council chiefs. Newport council said Velothon Wales had shown it met pollution standards and was exempt from an air quality plan.

But Mr Davies says the event, which is supported by many Welsh sports teams, doesn't comply with any plan.

Mr Davies told Express & Star: "After I made my criticism of the race being held in Newport, Velothon Wales contacted me and said they had been misquoted.

"They said at no point did they say the Race For Wales was approved for Velothon Wales's annual ride."

The Cycling Wales statement said Mr Davies "misunderstood the Velothon Wales application process".

"Cycling Wales does not support cycling for sport, but we think cyclists should have the right to choose where to ride in a way that is not harmful to their health and the environment."

The event is described on its website as an ‘ambitious event to test our resolve to achieve a truly sustainable future’.

It runs from Newport from Sunday, July 9 to Sunday, July 16.

It will feature a 1,750 mile (2,950 kilometre) cycle ride from London to Aberystwyth. Other teams taking part include the Wales rugby team, a group of 20 triathletes made up of a Welsh professional athletes and cycling team Procycling, a team of 10 rugby sevens players who are training to compete at the Rio Olympics next year

Cycling Wales say they hope cyclists using an app will be able to report air quality levels at the start and finish of the event.
