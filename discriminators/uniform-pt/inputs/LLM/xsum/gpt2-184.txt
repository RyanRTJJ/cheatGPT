 by the Premier League to look at the issue.

"It is disappointing that the chairman cannot accept this resignation," said an AIFF spokesman. "We will pursue a further appeal in the autumn, but we are optimistic that the club will now be given a more constructive view of what the process has become."

But a statement released by the League earlier this year said the club "will provide a clearer, more detailed and appropriate account of this matter," but added the Football Association was "not involved in this matter" and it was not expected to issue a statement.

The South Australian Premier Football League last week launched a probe into the matter after it emerged the club was asked to pay out a £60.4m civil penalty to Football Association whistleblower Shaun White over a payment to a former Premier League player he had paid through Inter's sponsorship deal.

One of the club's first actions after White's accusation made headlines in August 2007 was agreeing to pay the club the penalty.

The Football Association is now seeking a settlement of £25m, or almost half of the club's $50m sanction to White.

The Football Association last week agreed payments and the Football Association will continue to pursue the matter.

The action on Wednesday will force an investigation into the payment of the fine and is a further step towards a resolution.

White was fired from the club the following spring after it failed to provide him with a job or support.

He represented the South Australian Football League club at the international tribunal, who dismissed four members of the Football Association during a failed investigation into the matter.

Last week, an independent committee called in from the AFL and the National Football League to find out if the charges against White were true.

They said, based on White's claims of financial cover-ups and not a legal decision, they were likely to reject the report.


But the AFL said all seven of the four members of the panel considered the allegations to be false, including the two men who were charged.
