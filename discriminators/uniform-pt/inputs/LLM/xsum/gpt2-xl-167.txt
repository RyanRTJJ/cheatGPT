 been arrested on suspicion of death by dangerous driving.

Police were called to the scene just before 9am on Tuesday to reports that the victim had lost her balance while crossing the road.

Footage from the local news station shows the road coming to a grinding halt in the middle of the crossing, which police described as "extremely dangerous".

"The elderly female victim of the accident has sadly lost her life," a police spokeswoman said.

The driver of the van - who has been identified as a 52-year-old man from Darlington - has been taken into custody on suspicion of death by dangerous driving.

Police said the vehicle had been going against traffic when it struck the pedestrian who was crossing the road.

The incident caused serious traffic delays during the morning rush hour.

The male driver is assisting police with inquiries, but no arrests have been made.

Police are appealing for witnesses. You can contact police on 101, quoting incident number 901 of 9 February 2017.
