Dr Rowntree said the government's "wholesale reorganisation of Welsh government" would "make it difficult, if not impossible", for his "firmly-rooted Labour traditions" to remain in the Assembly.

He later said it was "regrettable that Welsh Labour did not see fit to give me the chance to offer my views in good faith".

Mr Gwynne, who was appointed vice-chairman of the Assembly in October, said in a statement on Thursday morning: "I am not prepared to see any harm come to a Welsh government-in-waiting, or to see further division within the Labour Party in Wales.

"We need unity across the Welsh Labour Party - we need to be standing together in support of a Labour government in Wales."

In a letter addressed to Mr Rowntree, he added that "if you cannot bring yourself to accept the overwhelming evidence, I am left with no option but to conclude that Welsh Labour is against a party office.

"In light of this, there is no need for you to delay your announcement any longer."

Mr Gwynne said he would contact party officials to "discuss my terms of reference" should he be selected as chairman, and had "invited the wider party to be part of that discussion".

"It is further evidence of the mess and dysfunction at the top of Welsh Labour
