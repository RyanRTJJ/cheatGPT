 brothers were beaten up by gangs of youths as they walked home from an ATM. Keary has spent five years researching gangs, organised crime and dealing with child sexual exploitation.

Ruth Mowbray, of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre in England and Wales, is a criminologist and author of the book " How To Survive Abusive and Violent Relationships." She advises agencies on how to tackle child abuse on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.

A former police officer, who works in London, who did not want to be identified, said he was alerted by an undercover investigation into one girl's alleged involvement in a grooming system that the woman is now alleged to have run. She was working as a babysitter and as a member of a gang, but he warned her to keep her mouth shut.

"I never thought of it as a normal relationship until all the publicity that was put out about this, all the social media about this and even more, the abuse that I witnessed," he said.

According to the police, many of the children allegedly abused are aged three to 12, that they may be separated, separated between people and at certain times, that they may be alone, often for years or indefinitely.

Mowbray, who has been researching gangs and organised crime for 30 years, said most victims do not immediately report their abuse to a service such as child protection, to avoid prosecution and to avoid being judged for failing to protect children by a traditional authority figure.

She said one victim, who became involved after she became involved with a child support campaigner, told her how her children were often kept "in captivity" by their mother while they were not sleeping.

According to the British Association for People Abused in Childhood (BAPAC), there is not as much stigma attached to the term abusive relationships among female children in many countries, and that, if a relationship turns into domestic abuse, the abuse and emotional, psychological and financial abuse are much more readily recognised than the actual violence.
