The Taliban is seeking to crush opposition to its power-grabbing by replacing foreign-backed governments in Afghanistan. Last week it forced out the governing council of the northern provincial capital, Kunduz and declared the government in office a terrorist organisation – the same designation as al-Qaida and Isis.
