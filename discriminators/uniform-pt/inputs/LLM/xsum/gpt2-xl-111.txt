 striker hit the woodwork on the final two minutes to keep them level - and he will have the chance to help the side qualify for the next phase of the UEFA Champions League next season.

However, there was still time for former Manchester United and Southampton defender Morgan Schneiderlin to make the third-tier Champions League group stage for the first time, with Southampton's goal the basis for his third successive start.

Despite their first-leg aggregate loss, Southampton moved four points ahead in Group M - two ahead of Group C leaders Real Madrid.

Ronald Koeman's side were in no mood to settle for second place, and are now three points clear of Feyenoord by winning the next two games.

Despite a first-half performance that brought to mind a less entertaining midweek Premier League fixture at Southampton, Saints still found a way through at the end to ensure that there could be no replay in Cyprus.

Saints had a numerical advantage with 11 men ahead of their second European match of the season, as they knew their opponents would be able to attack into space easily if they drew level.

But they did not take their chances too easily, with Tottenham struggling to control the middle of the pitch following the introduction of midfielder Nabil Bentaleb with eight minutes left.

Kieran Trippier made an effort from distance but the ball hit the inside of the post, while Kevin Long was tripped down on the edge of his box by a retreating Trippier before the break.

Tottenham's chances appeared to improve after the restart when Christian Eriksen and Luka Milivojevic met crosses from the right flank, but both efforts were weak and wasted before Schneiderlin's first half strike.

But Spurs kept their nerve - and the hope of returning to Europe's elite competition at the expense of second-placed Borussia Dortmund - thanks to Erik Lamela.

The midfielder's powerful low effort found the top corner to double Southampton's lead at the break, and he showed the strength and composure that could make him indispensable for Mauricio Pochettino
