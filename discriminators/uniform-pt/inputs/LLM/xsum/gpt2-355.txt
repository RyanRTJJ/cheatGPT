 "out-of-control and inappropriate" investigation into the security at the UK's airports, particularly the UK Naval Base near Calais and the Calais-based base in Calais, and there was a "complete lack of security clearance for this particular operation". It believes this resulted in those who were detained trying to board aircraft returning to the UK illegally carrying the "highly classified information". Ofsted's own independent reports say that at least five staff who were suspected to have been in the UK illegally were cleared.

A spokesman said that no one was responsible and he could not confirm that this was an issue of official security or whether any staff had travelled in and out of Dover at the time of the incident. Ofsted also said that it had received no further notice from inspectors. That meant that they could now be questioned by the same investigators who had visited Dover and questioned those suspected of leaving France and arrived safely. The spokesman said that there are two senior security officers involved in the investigation but he would not say which one or which one.

The spokesman said: "We are working with our French counterparts to ensure that all relevant issues do not slip into the wrong hands. This is a crucial time for all of us, and this investigation has only just begun. A detailed, independent review has already revealed an open, transparent process involving the intelligence services. The failure of both of these agencies to follow any standard and properly investigate any suspicious circumstances could make every case more likely to fail."

The spokesman's statements are further evidence that the Department of Education's investigation is still ongoing, although the spokesperson said that the department had been informed about the situation.

Sir Michael commented: "One of the best aspects of the inquiry into the alleged security breach at Dover was the prompt, thorough inquiry that will be conducted here in the coming months,"

Sir Michael also took to Twitter - which is now the largest, largest and most widely read word. He tweeted a photo of a "little girl" on a yellow line in
