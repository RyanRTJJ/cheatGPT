 on suspicion of her murder.

A source close to Mr Adams said: "He was arrested during an operation run out of west Belfast involving detectives from the Special Crime Branch, the Special Branch unit charged with dealing with those who act in breach of the peace.

"Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams and his wife Marie were arrested by detectives under the authority of the Provisional IRA."

A source close to Mr Adams, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of his defence in the High Court case, insisted the prime minister had been "blindsided".

"Had Mr Adams been told as early as 1974 that they were to be used against him we might still be around today," the source said.

"For Mr Adams to have been informed at that stage was deeply irresponsible.

"He will be facing claims that his policies and views are incompatible with his party, with the Labour party, with the Conservative party, with loyalist republicans.

"This could well be true. We will put our case for him to withdraw, but we will not back down from what we believe to be the right approach."

An IRA arrest warrant issued in May on the alleged murder of Mrs McConway, who was stabbed several times but survived, named the IRA's IRA chief Frank McMurray as a suspect but said he would not be charged until a charge against Mr Adams was laid.

Following her disappearance on October 1, 1972, Mrs McConville disappeared in the early hours of the morning, leaving her body behind on her doorstep, with a note taped over her front door.

The note claimed she had been kidnapped in connection with the murder of Randal O'Regan, a prominent Republican Army commander.

Mr Adams was released from prison in
