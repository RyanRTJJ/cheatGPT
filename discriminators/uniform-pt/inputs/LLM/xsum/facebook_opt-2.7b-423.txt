 by up to 20% as a result of the higher wholesale price.

"We have not raised our dual fuel price since its introduction because we set it at one-third of the cost to the customer," Scottish Power said in a statement.

The company, which runs gas and electricity networks in England and Wales, said that it will raise wholesale electricity prices from April by 5.5% for customers on dual fuel and 5.75% for those who switch contracts.

By comparison, the UK's big six energy suppliers, which include the Big Six and smaller challenger providers, have said their average dual fuel tariff prices will rise by 3% from April, according to consumer watchdog Which?.

The Big Six energy suppliers make up almost two-thirds of the energy price market in England and Wales, according to Ofgem.

The rise is the result of the UK's decision to leave the European Union, which has caused global instability in energy markets.

The move by ScottishPower is also expected to raise the cost of supplying homes with dual fuel. But ScottishPower said this would mean it was "simplifying" its energy plans and would save customers money in the long term.

The company said it has passed back all price rises to customers over the last year, when its rivals also faced higher costs.

ScottishPower said it is now switching more of its customers onto its dual-fuel tariffs, which were about 40% of its UK dual-fuel customer base at the end of March, compared with about 18% last year.

The energy firm said it also saved Â£1bn since last March by working out which areas in the UK are profitable and which are not, compared to last year, when this information was not available.

ScottishPower has just announced a 19% price rise for dual fuel customers. And I've just seen another 19% from the big 6. And now 19% from Scottish Power too.

This comes off the back of an 11% increase they've announced at the end of last year.

I wonder if they would announce a 19% cut in that case?

I've moved to a Scottish supplier - I don't miss the Big 6.
