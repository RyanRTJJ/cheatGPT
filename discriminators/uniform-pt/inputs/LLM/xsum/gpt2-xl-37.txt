 4.1%. Broadcasting revenue was up 4.3%, to £1.25bn.

But despite the progress in attracting viewers, the news industry is still having difficult years. UKTV said on Thursday that it was cutting about 10% of its workforce, including staff on the flagship programme Newsnight.

"This is a challenging time for news and we are making sure we retain every employee to deliver at a high standard," said the broadcaster's managing director, Andy Parsons.

He added: "For us, these changes reflect our commitment to ensure the highest levels of editorial quality and transparency with the consumer. We are taking steps that will ensure that we can continue to meet the ambition of the industry as a whole to deliver value for money for all of the UK's viewers."

The BBC said it was trying to adapt to the challenges facing its news divisions.

"We're investing £200m in the biggest digital news initiative in BBC history, and in digital innovation across all our editorial activities, including at BBC News – the number one digital news brand in the world – and on our flagship programme Newsnight," said a statement from James Harding, chief executive of the corporation.

"At the same time, we're developing ways to deliver the very best news for our audiences in the world's most diverse country."

The number of people subscribing to a digital-only subscription TV service declined by 5% to 31 million in the year ending 31 May 2016, the BBC said. UKTV said that over the year ending 30 June 2016, it had 7% fewer online subs than the previous year.

BBC2 saw a 2% rise in online subs to 30 million. It continues to be the most successful news division, with digital spending hitting £98m in the year ending June 2016 – 2% up on the previous year.

BBC3 made a small 6.6% increase in digital subs to 27 million. It has been in the news for a shake-up of its news programme on BBC3.
