 animal tests, this could open the door to new technologies in diagnostics.

"We can see, for example, how much exposure patients have received," says Dr. Gartner, who is also the director of the Cancer Research UK Centre for Applied Medical Research in Oxford. "This becomes predictive not only of the type of cancer, but also of sensitivity to radiotherapy, in terms of survival."

But Gartner worries that the technology is limited for its current applications. For example, people with lung cancer might not be able to be identified from the technology, since doctors may have to wait for the machine to provide certain tests before knowing whether a patient has a bad prognosis.

"The ultimate goals are to make sure that a patient has no pre-malignant cells left within the lung. We do not know whether that will actually happen," says Gartner, who is also the president of the National Committee for Quality Assurance in UK health care.

Researchers hope if this project gets off the ground, "a device like this would become available in the future for general use as a test for lung cancer."

What if these changes were early signs of cancer?

For every dollar the U.S. invests in health care per person, it pays out $1.56. A dollar invested in the same effort would provide net benefits in every region of the country - including rural areas.

It pays to invest in good health for our communities. Invest in your heart, lungs, and brain.

Mental health issues affect nearly 50 percent of Americans. That's the same percentage we use to treat people with physical illnesses. But, to pay for the increased need for mental health services, we must also cut the costs of behavioral health services.

A great way to help make mental health services more accessible, affordable and culturally relevant, is to create better access to community mental health services.

By improving mental health services in your community, you'll be able to increase access
