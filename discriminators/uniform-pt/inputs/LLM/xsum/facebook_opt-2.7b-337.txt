 event for his 80th birthday party at the time of his death.

His daughter, Diane, told The Guardian: "Everyone knows Peter as one of the most generous and giving people in the South London community where I grew up.

"A pillar of support to many organisations and groups, he was particularly keen to support the National Grid. When he died, the National Grid was delivering electricity to his house after the blackout.

"He truly believed that without electricity there would be no life."

She said her father, who also ran four restaurants, was "in the middle of renovating houses" when the electricity was cut. His wife died three years ago.

"At the moment he was doing the electrical work and there was a power cut, and then I received a call from the coroner's office reporting he had died trying to help his daughter get an electric socket out of a kitchen cupboard.

"He was looking for any way he could help. He was such a determined person."

His cousin, Nigel Griffiths, 77, added: "Peter was a very giving man who supported many charities. He was an excellent cook and was the head chef at The Stables restaurant in Clapham."

The National Grid and SouthWestern Electric, which provides electricity in the South London community, said there was nothing more it could do for Mr Rhodes after he died.

Both organisations said he helped them with electricity engineering projects over his lifetime.

Southwestern Electric managing director David Wright said: "Our thoughts at the time were with Peter's family and our thoughts remain with them at this incredibly difficult time.

"He was an extremely skilled engineer who was a key member of our workforce for many years. Peter helped us tackle the problems to get electricity back on for our customers in Clapham immediately after the power cut."

David said engineers from Southwestern Electric were still on the scene to help those living in the area.
