Hodge is already on a run of form. A week ago the Glasgow Lions lost to Wales and it was that final defeat that forced Edinburgh Rugby into thinking about making a move for the 22-year-old.

It would have been easy for him to have been the leading man if the Lions had dropped their No.4 pick, but after the impressive form he demonstrated for the British and Irish Lions
