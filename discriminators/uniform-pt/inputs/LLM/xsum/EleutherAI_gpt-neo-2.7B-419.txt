 UK (England, Wales, Northern Ireland) museums. It had to be removed before it could be on display, so the Apollo 11 crew took a photo of it which became one of the key documents for the Apollo program. It is now owned by the National Museum of American History.

The "Rock Around the Moon" video

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Apollo Lunar Module LEM was modified, so that it could be landed on the Moon by astronauts in a simulated Apollo Lunar Module. The LEM was the largest space vehicle to ever land on the Moon, and it also enabled the astronauts to do what they wanted while the LEM was on the Moon. However, a problem developed when the LEM made contact with the lunar surface. What exactly had happened was unknown.

The Apollo 11 team decided to try and solve this problem with an experiment. They built a small experimental lander and attached it to the LEM, which was still on station in lunar orbit. With the guidance systems of the LEM controlling the lander, the team took it in and around the Moon. They got it wrong, sending it off course and coming back to Earth. On board the lander was part of the NASA Apollo 11 Lunar Lander Training Program, and the crew made sure to document the experiment. For years, it was believed to have flown over the Moon and had crashed.

However, it was only the Apollo 11 Lunar Lander that took them into an area in that shot. The rest of the story is about that. It is now owned by the National Museum of American History.

The Apollo 11 Lunar Lander

The Lunar Lander was part of a NASA program to test the safety of space vehicles, and it was attached underneath the LEM in place of a life support system. The idea was that the astronauts would land on-board so that NASA could replace the
