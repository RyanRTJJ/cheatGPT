 Rathlin, a veteran of two Gulf War conflicts, won by an inch over his opponents, with the runner-up being a 17-year-old from New Zealand.

"I've been training for two and a half years for this race," Captain Rathlin said.

But he was unable to give details of whether his prosthesis was the best or worst he had ever come across, as a result of a fire near a machine at the end of the 12-mile course, preventing him from finishing the race.

"I got some smoke on my back after the finish line â€¦ that's on me, not on the prosthetic leg. I can't say I was the best," Rathlin said, describing what went wrong.

According to an online report from Reuters, Captain Rathlin was "slammed by his opponent, who was still in the fight" after he became "a flying target for a mortar round in the firefight" surrounding the finish line.

Captain Rathlin, who also had a prosthetic leg during the race, was reportedly the first to run in to the gunfire, prompting the runner-up to fall, the report said.

"I was getting my rear end bashed in by my opponent's butt," Captain Rathlin was quoted as telling Reuters. "That is not the greatest feeling in the world. I think in fairness the runner up suffered from a head injury at the end. After I'd been shot by the opponent's gun I had a cut. I think all the nerves went through my butt when he ran past me."

"They gave me a new prosthetic leg as a souvenir," he said.

Rathlin is now "on the mend", the report said, adding that the prosthetic thigh had a more flexible surface than his original prosthetic leg and "he didn't have to put anything in his leg. The leg didn't rip. It was just very hot."
