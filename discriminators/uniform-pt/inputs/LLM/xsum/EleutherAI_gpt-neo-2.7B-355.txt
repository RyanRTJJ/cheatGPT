 improvement in some aspects of the way head teachers communicate with parents but, on the whole, it still sees things as “unacceptable.” The worst thing this will do is continue to allow parents to hold Ofsted to account.

The other side of the headline: the findings and implications for those who wanted to hold Ofsted to account. That’s not a surprise. Ofsted’s findings did not surprise anyone – not parents, not teachers, not ministers, not the press. It doesn’t matter who looks at them or how they are examined – if Ofsted’s methodology has been adopted, then they should be adopted.

More so when this is conducted through an investigation rather than a report, as most Ofsted report into teacher training courses, not into their subject specific and practice based work. The press did love to talk of one of their
