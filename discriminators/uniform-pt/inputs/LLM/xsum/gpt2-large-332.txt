000 of its customers, compared to 742 for Scottish Wind.

According to the department, when it arrived at its tally, the worst performing energy service provider for the majority of its customers in 2013 was SSE, which saw over 150 complaints per 100,000.

In terms of the number of calls to its consumer helpline, the worst performing provider, Scottish Power, said there had been 944 complaints per 100,000 of its customers compared with 742 for Scottish Wind.

The number of complaints made to Scottish Wind was not available.

Scottish Power warned last month that if it did not increase its investment to help reduce demand as fast as possible, it could struggle to pay back its debts. The utility said it is investing in more wind turbines that cost $50m - more than 100 times what the rest of the sector invested in a single wind farm.

The company's head of business development, Peter Stewart, wrote in October that the cost was $55m, with $15m a year.

The Scottish Wind report suggests that even when Scottish power was delivering the lowest number of calls, it is still the most efficient.

It says the average complaint to the company fell by 10% last year, to 42 per 100,000 of its customers.

And the cost of disputes to its customer centre of $13.7m, which compares with $27m for the rest of the sector, is significantly lower.

Scottish Power has vowed to reach its peak spending on wind power in 2024 and is investing $50m a year.

However, the report has shown that just over half of its service staff are unemployed.

Scottish Wind reports its turnover in the first half of last year was $28.4m, compared to $54.8m a year earlier.

The report shows that it has lost $10.4m which resulted in the loss of 0.7 staff in the year ending in October.
