"The last two years of the Welsh Labour Party have been dominated by a series of very high-profile controversies.

"It's hard not to draw a parallel to a family where the youngest son, who is three quarters of the way through the senior years of the first marriage, is getting divorced and the other members of the family, on whom support is no longer forthcoming, are sitting around waiting for him to come back to his senses."
