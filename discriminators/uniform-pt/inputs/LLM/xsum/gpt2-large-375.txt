3 billion from shareholders since 2011.

Shares in Olympus are down 16% over the past two days.

On Thursday, the company said a major restructuring plan, part of a restructuring plan in place since the end of 2011, has exposed "significant liabilities". Its financial statements also said it expected to record significant negative effects on its 2016 sales for the first time since the collapse of its share market bubble.

It has been revealed that Olympus' UK head has lost his job following a review of its financial health. His replacement, the company's director of global finance, will be in charge of the company's overseas operations until the end of the year.

The director of international finance is understood to be David Williams, who has held the posting up until now. He worked for Olympus from 2010 until August 2015.
