 style and they have had a couple of injuries around the middle," he explains. "As is the case now, they've got a great team, they've got a great attack down the left end, and they won back their international rugby, so that's always a big compliment. We'll go into the game prepared to play a pretty tough rugby, but they're one of the form teams in world rugby."

The Lions, on the other hand, are also "one of the form teams internationally". With captain Emon Aneke being the only international player (as of publication) at his team (the only one who's truly qualified to take part as a representative), he says that his experience is the reason his side is "an easy team to play against".

"Our style is a lot like the All Blacks at home. If you make one mistake you're playing down to your last man and you're probably going to lose. That's what we saw against Paris in Paris and that was true for Bath."

Asked about their line-out and passing skills, Aneke is very direct. "We're doing a bit to develop it, so we can make more of it, but we just need players to play with a bit more confidence that in the last 20 metres they can carry themselves with."

Although they're the main beneficiaries of their back-to-back victories, Lions players are equally excited about the return of the All Blacks. "We're very proud of what our players have accomplished so far," Nicol adds. "We didn't lose anyone on this side, we beat three teams in their own backs at home, and that show's what they truly are, they're a helluva team. They look fantastic after their break, and we've got guys who are hungry as well. I'd hate to see anyone come in here and be worried about being matched with them but they're a huge improvement, and we all see the improvement in them. They know that if they don't pick up speed we're going to lose.

"We don't want to drop any points here and we want to maintain the momentum through these games, and we know it will come back as we move our way out of the big
