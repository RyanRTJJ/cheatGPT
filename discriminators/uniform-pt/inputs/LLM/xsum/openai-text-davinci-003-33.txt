 by 2020, will open up the facility to larger vessels so it can handle more freight.

The Scottish Government said the project will help create jobs, support economic growth and bring environmental benefits to the area. It added that it is part of the "unlock Aberdeen" city deal which is designed to improve the city's infrastructure and bolster local businesses.

As part of the project, a deeper channel will be dredged through Nigg Bay allowing larger vessels to access the harbour, improved quayside facilities will be created and a new pontoon will be installed.

Ms Sturgeon said: "The expansion of the River Ness harbour is a fantastic example of how Scottish Enterprise, the Scottish Government and Aberdeen City Council are working together to support industry and the local economy in Aberdeen. 

“This major project will enable larger vessels to access the harbour and create an important freight hub. It will also unlock more potential for the increasing number of jobs in port and maritime related activities, making Aberdeen and the wider North East of Scotland an attractive place to do business.

“The construction phase of the project will bring additional investment to the city and significantly contribute to employment.”
