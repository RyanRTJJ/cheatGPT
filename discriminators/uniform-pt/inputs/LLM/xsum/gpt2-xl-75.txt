 that give the state powers to ban "political campaigning" â€” anything from leafleting to leafletting outside trade union offices.

A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "We are confident we have listened to the many organisations that have raised concerns about certain provisions in the Trade Union Bill."

Smith said: "It is clear then that Scottish Trade Union Legislation would be better served by devolution.

"This is because it allows the Scottish parliament and the elected assembly to address issues such as public funding for unions such as the NHS."

But he added: "The Scottish government has failed to engage with the wider trade union movement, and Scottish Labour is clearly unwilling to engage constructively with the trade unions.

"I'm concerned that a Scottish Government which is now actively pursuing this piece of legislation in the trade unions courts is not interested in any constructive engagement with the trade unions."

'Huge leap towards union centralism'

A Scottish government spokesman said: "The Trade Union Bill is a radical piece of legislation that will allow the Scottish Parliament and the elected devolved assembly to ensure Scotland has the right protections to tackle the root cause of union corruption and to tackle abuse of power.

"Trade unions and other organisations working in Scotland must be able to express their views freely and not be afraid of the consequences.

"The legislation that will enable the Scottish government to deal with these issues is a significant step forward. It is also the culmination of more than two years work on this Bill, which included extensive engagement with stakeholders, the devolution of certain powers to empower the Scottish parliament, and a detailed examination of the complex issues surrounding union democracy and power."

He added: "Unionists voted for devolution in the 1979 referendum to make a fairer deal for working people in Scotland.

"Unionists are committed to an alternative path with trade unions, for all our members and for trade unionists generally in Scotland."

It is expected the SNP will use the bill to introduce a "fairness clause" into the Scottish constitution that could see unions face higher statutory penalties for union
