 was contacted by the council telling her a mistake had been made with the email she sent to her local authority ward council. Police were called into the incident at St James’s North ward, close to the city’s city centre, and the force has now launched a criminal investigation into the handling of the incident.

The BBC reported the woman had accidentally sent her address, email address, telephone number and bank details to the council and, as a result, some of the information got into people’s hands in the days afterwards.

The council apologised to the woman and the incident was initially referred to the information standards board, which found there was no need to take any action.

The case has caused outrage among the woman’s friends. The BBC added a spokeswoman for Newcastle City Council said the authority “sincerely regrets” the incident, adding that privacy was “a fundamental democratic right”.

The police have launched a criminal investigation with officers from the force’s anti-corruption squad investigating the matter. Police sources told the BBC they had interviewed two people.

A spokeswoman for Newcastle City Council added it would not tolerate any breaches of privacy.

“We have put in place additional measures to ensure any future incidents are prevented and to ensure any victims of this type of incident are reassured and taken care of,” the spokeswoman was quoted as saying.

The council’s chief executive, Tony Harrington, said he and the council’s deputy leader have apologised to the woman.

Asked if she should consider taking legal action, Harrington said: “We will respect whatever decisions she chooses to make. We have apologised to her.”

A spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We have received a request from a person who is a victim of this incident from a number of parties and are considering this carefully.”
