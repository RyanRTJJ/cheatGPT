 17% to 1.1 billion units, up 10,000 jobs, more than half the increase for ice cream stores.

The industry lost 6,000 manufacturing jobs to private sector outsourcing in the first eight months of this year. The loss of those jobs comes amid continued competition from craft and food brands such as MillerCoors, Whole Foods and Dairy Queen, and after the companies have taken back millions of dollars, sales at smaller food chains, such as McDonald's, have slowed.


This year, the retail industry saw its revenues increase at its fastest pace in five years. Sales of ice cream dropped to its lowest level in seven years, which has had implications for the $14.5 billion that the industry had spent so far.


The report also suggested the sector made a $500 million gain. That led several industry players to issue statements suggesting it could have been used to gain additional cash flow.


The New York Post reported that New York restaurateur John Schnatter is in talks to join other smaller restaurant owners to add new restaurants as part of a deal that could open up New York to more growth of its restaurants and increase the value of restaurants in New York.


"This will be the first crack at a major shift in retail and a shift that is creating both growing and more profitable businesses," said Jeff Gagnon, senior vice president and general manager for online sales at O'Reilly Media Inc., a group set up in 2010 to help entrepreneurs with online sales.


Elliott said the announcement could spur consumers to buy more ice cream, at a cost of buying more pizza and fewer ice cream sandwiches.

A spokesman for O'Reilly said the deal could allow the company to sell more ice cream at a cheaper price.

"O'Reilly is not interested in creating jobs in New York," he said. "He wants to bring New York up to scratch in terms of what other businesses are doing."
