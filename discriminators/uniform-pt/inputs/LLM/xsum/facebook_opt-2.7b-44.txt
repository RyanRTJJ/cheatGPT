The torch will then make its way through Buckingham Palace. The first leg of the torch's journey will include a tour of the Royal Mews and the Mews Bar in Buckingham Palace. In the evening the torch will be lit by the Queen and Prince Philip at an event at the Palace, which will also include a fireworks display to represent the flame's journey in the sky.

From tomorrow (30 July) the Olympic torch will make its way through the UK's capital city, where it will visit museums, the Tate, and London's Tower Bridge as well as landmarks such as Her Majesty's House and the Tower of London. The torch will then arrive in Manchester in the early hours of the morning before being flown later that day (31 July) to Belfast, where it will rest overnight before departing in the early hours of Wednesday morning (1 August). The torch will make its way on a final journey to Cardiff, from where the flame will go on a final leg of its journey, visiting St Mary's Cathedral and Cardiff Castle.

This is the 18th year that the Olympic torch will arrive in the UK. Since 2008, the torch has been taken on a journey from Athens to Beijing.

"These amazing moments, which form part of the torch's journey, allow people from across the country to share the atmosphere brought by the Olympic flame," said a LOCOG spokesperson.

The flame will then be flown to the centre of Athens, where the flame will take part in a torch procession which will include the lighting of the torch by the Mayor of Athens. It will also be taken on the first day of sport. For more details, visit www.olympictorch.com.
