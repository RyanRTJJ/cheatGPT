 immunity from the prosecution to the men.

A former Ncoghane, who lives in another Co Down village, said the latest round of arrests was “incredible and it’s another example of the PSNI achieving what it has always striven to do”.

They said he believed the men, and others who had received “significant” rewards from the NPSI, were the ones who carried out the raids on the Carrickmacross house in the last two days.

The arrests are not new, however. The PSNI previously arrested a former Ncoghane from the town on suspicion of child abuse relating to the rape of a child in April 2016 (the case collapsed over the next three years) and another alleged abuser, who had received a substantial NPSI reward, in mid-October of 2018.

The former Ncoghana was also alleged to have a history of violent altercations with his neighbours and neighbours’ children. His two housemates, who were among the last to hear him singing on Saturday night, were the first to alert police after he was arrested. He was subsequently jailed for three years.

The PSNI has said officers were also working on a second house raid at Carrickmacross. The former Ncoghane, who they allege may have had a history of domestic violence, lived there for six years with his wife. His former housemate, who witnessed the police raid of the second house on Saturday and described the events to detectives, has also been charged with various incidents of abuse on Saturday night.

The former Ncoghana is expected to appear at the Royal Inniscarra court, Carrickmacross, later today. He is further charged with assaulting his brother’s sister, following the raid of the second house.

The PSNI confirmed all eight men charged on Saturday, with the eight being from a family of three, had been granted immunity but it would be applying to the courts to secure the remainder of their charges.
