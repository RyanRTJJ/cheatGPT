 since last Friday's vote.

"There will certainly be a dialogue (between representatives of MPs and voters)," the speaker said.

"We want to get in front of what are our principles and our laws, the principles that we had agreed to, the rules, laws, to put something back on top of the mountain and to be accountable in order to build our country, to build our society," he said.

The opposition leader, Freddy Guevara, said he feared the new constitution would impose strict curbs on political freedoms.

"We can see it for what it says. A power grab at the expense of basic liberties, democracy, human rights, the freedom of religion and speech," he said after the assembly met.

Opposition lawmaker Luis Carlos Montez tried to appeal to the people to abstain from voting, while President Nicolas Maduro told the assembly he hoped Venezuelans felt free to vote for him.

The opposition has been holding weekly protest rallies in the capital Caracas since April, as well as in other cities such as Merida, San Cristobal, Barinas and other towns.

The government says the demonstrators are being paid by the United States.

"What if we voted... and the right to demonstrate was completely nullified?" asked Maduro in the assembly.

Maduro says the protests have been orchestrated by the United States, which he accuses of seeking to topple him to get control of the OPEC state.

Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA (PDVSA.N), has filed a case against the national assembly with the Inter-American Court for Human Rights, saying the measures being pushed through the assembly violate its right to self-determination enshrined in the 1998 constitution.

The United States is OPEC's biggest market and oil exports account for 75% of Venezuela's exports, and over half the state's foreign reserves.

"We have no other choice," said the assembly speaker. "We will no longer be able to remain silent."
