ld be impossible to bring Evans – who is retiring next year – out of the force and back into an operational role.

Bangham said: "Unfortunately, it is against our policy to allow any police officer to continue serving once they reach the mandatory retirement age. We also cannot transfer any member of police staff into an operational role. We are aware of how close the bond between Sgt Evans and Ivy is and we understand the public support for them to stay together, but we must follow established policy in this case."

The news was a disappointment for those campaigning for the pair to stay together. Sgt Evans has been a handler for police dogs for several years and Ivy has been his faithful companion for the past four years. Sgt Evans expressed gratitude for all the support he and Ivy had received during the campaign and expressed his disappointment at the news. 

Despite Bangham's announcement, the issue of police dog handlers and pets has made headlines across Britain, as individuals and organisations continue to push for humane policies. Several police departments across the country are now considering changes to their retirement policies, while charities and members of the public are calling for greater understanding of how important the bond between a handler and their dog can be.
