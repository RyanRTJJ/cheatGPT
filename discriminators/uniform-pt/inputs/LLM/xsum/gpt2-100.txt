 in shifts. Instead, they recommend that companies employ women in their group to take advantage of the opportunities of shift work in hospitals and clinics, which have a lower prevalence and lower mortality rates than shift work. They also said that women should avoid working long shifts due to complications among them and the risk of getting sick or having serious problems after work. Finally, the researchers concluded that research into working in the "safe sex" industry could help to address some of these concerns and provide some tools for women seeking help in finding work.

A "Worthwhile Question"

If these studies are of value, it's easy to understand how we might look at shift work in our country, says Dr. Tumma. That may include the costs of treating cancer in the care we already have.

"It's still not clear how many men are on a shift that is the least safe and the least stressful," she says. "It's also not clear for us how many of those men are working and how much is being left out of our data."

Research is still a long way off because some of the most important questions about the practice of shift work, including the impact on health care costs, are still being developed, says Dr. Duklak, who is also director of the Institute for Women's Health Policy at the Duke University School of Medicine's Division of Health Policy and Management. The shift work can be a costly, time-consuming and difficult endeavor if it is not immediately obvious that someone in the transition group will shift to that role.

"We still must be able to evaluate if that's the safest space for women. There are some who are saying 'yes,' but we've got to do something about this," she says. "With all the work going on, it's time for us to get clear on this: should men be taking on the most challenging roles? Some of the research we did suggested that men take their shifts to care for their partner or in their household for work safety, but that's not necessarily true â€“ we don't want people taking on responsibilities as men in that role."
