 also drawn 1-1 with Real Madrid in La Liga back in November at the Bernabeu to end their run of 13 straight victories against their bitter rivals. Atletico will have to find a way to overcome Real at the Vicente Calderon in December if they want to catch Barca, who have a three-point lead on Madrid at the top of the league.

But Luis Enrique’s side are also not ruling out a possible victory at the Bernabeu in the Clasico, with reports suggesting Ronald Koeman’s side are favourites ahead of Sunday’s game, according to Diario Gol.

Messi has missed the last two league games due to injury, and has had to watch from the stands as Barca’s attacking trio of Luis Suarez, Neymar and Gabriel Mercado have shone without him.

Neymar, who has scored 19 league goals this season, has scored in each of his last five league starts, including both goals in the 2-0 win over Celta Vigo on Saturday. Despite the impressive form from the Brazilian, Barca are unlikely to rotate their team for the clash with Atletico, as they are still chasing the title.

Barcelona have won at La Real in their last five meetings and have just one victory from their last nine league appearances in the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu. But their last five away games in Madrid have all been victories.

Atletico failed to score a single goal in their defeat at the Nou Camp in November, which had some saying the Argentine was still at fault after he was deemed guilty for missing a penalty against Sevilla.

Neymar’s future has been further complicated by injury and Messi’s return, with Barcelona’s president Josep Maria Bartomeu confirming negotiations are ongoing earlier this week. Messi is reportedly set to be offered a £1.3million-a-week deal if he agrees to leave the club for free. This will put an end to several rumours indicating the Argentinian’s intentions in the coming months,
