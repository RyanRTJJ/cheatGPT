 It’s taken more than a month but now there’s a picture of an unknown object that could potentially be more than a million years old.
So where are all these aliens now?

When I started my first year of college in the fall of 2010 I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. I was kind of aimlessly floating around, going nowhere.
After thinking about what I wanted to do, I realized it was time for a change. I eventually ended up deciding to attend medical school. It's now been almost 2 years, and I’ve finally graduated from Tulane School of Medicine in May 2015.
My main reason for going into medical field is because I would like to prove to myself that I can be not only successful in school and in life, but that I could also become something that brings joy to people's lives. Also, patients need us and we can be the key to making their lives just a little bit better.
After having a good experience every morning with my co-workers, the morning is always more enjoyable… and that is the reason why it has really become my passion.
People say that we live in a fast-paced world and we have been blessed the opportunity to have everything brought right on our doorstep. Therefore, if the price is convenience — then I feel we should give up on more convenience like taking time to read books to be able to expand our brain for our personal growth.
