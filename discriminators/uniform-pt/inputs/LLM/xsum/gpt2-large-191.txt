 Salaried Staffs' (TSS) union and the Maritime and Transport Alliance (MTA) union said they would be voting against industrial action. On Thursday, the RMT and the MTA said they would be voting in favour of work stoppage in the coming days.

The workers' response came after the company said it was still waiting for its final letter from the RMT to formally recognise the union. That means a vote by the RMT could take several weeks to complete.

The strike's potential impact could extend beyond the railway, as part of the TGS' work is already being carried out in the US. That means some of the railway's other work would go ahead uninterrupted.

Transport Semiconductors Ltd (TSC Ltd), which owns the TGS, said it was disappointed and saddened by Wednesday's strike announcement but would continue with its operations.

"Given the current market and market conditions in general, we have indicated we are comfortable with the current operating conditions we are operating under. TSC has not yet requested the RMT endorse the industrial action at this time and does not have an intention of doing so," it said.

John Ahern, chairman of the RMT's London, North East and West Midlands division said: "We take a clear view that, despite all efforts by the government and rail companies to minimise the disruption and costs borne by our members, this industrial action is still the wrong resolution to the dispute. This is a major blow to workers in the rail industry and to the wider economy. "

Rail union Unite said it had voted for industrial action because it wanted a "fair pay rise" and to stop job cuts. "RMT members and their families have suffered over eight months of continuous pressure, neglect, discrimination and attacks on living standards," Unite general secretary Bob Crow said.

A total of 2,160 members of 1,600 TGS staff are expected to join the TGS' industrial action starting on Friday, when
