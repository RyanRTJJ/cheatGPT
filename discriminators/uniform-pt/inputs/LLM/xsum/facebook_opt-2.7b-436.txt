 moment which is the structure of the men's game itself," he writes in the Daily Telegraph. "The divisions in our game need reform.

"The Football Association does not understand the game and needs a fresh set of eyes to help with the reforms it can make.

"The game needs to concentrate on the grass-roots. Its centralised structure must change."

FIFA is also under pressure for failing to implement rules to prevent players from leaving or joining international teams even though they face international transfer bans over corruption allegations.

"The idea of FIFA needs to be seriously rethought," says Reyna. "FIFA is not delivering on things such as transfer ban exemptions. The problem with the international rules is that they are too far away - some countries like Qatar will have FIFA regulations for two, four, five years. There needs to be a more active role for FIFA, it's become very big and is not delivering what it was set up to do."

Claudio Reyna says the future of football was at risk

The former German international was also critical of the Champions League's format and claimed that its introduction to Europe in 1992 was part of "a series of steps" to destroy the English game. The former Bayern Munich striker, who won four European Cups with AC Milan, Bayer Leverkusen and Barca, said "the domestic competition has lost its value as a major event".
