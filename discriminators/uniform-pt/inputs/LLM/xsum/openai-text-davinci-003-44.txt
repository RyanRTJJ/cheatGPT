 in library spending with a 20.9% fall from 2013/14, followed by an 18.6% fall in Scotland and a 12.4% fall in England.

The total spend on libraries throughout Britain fell by 15.8%, to £659 million. In England, councils spent £455 million, a drop of 12.4%. In Wales, expenditure dropped to £58 million, a fall of 20.9%, while in Scotland it was £145 million, 18.6% less than 2013/14.

The figures reveal that there is a stark north-south divide in library spending. While in England 77% of library spending was invested in the south, the proportion was higher in Wales (88%) and Scotland (95%). In Wales and Scotland, funding was also disproportionality weighted in favour of the largest four metropolitan areas, with over half of library spending going to those areas.

Cipfa warned that despite an overall rise in library users and visits, this is coupled with a decline in spending and a reduction in the number libraries being maintained. In England, Wales and Scotland, the figures show that over 400 library facilities have closed since 2013/14.

Cipfa's head of finance and assurance, Rob Whiteman, said: "We have seen significant reductions in library expenditure since 2013/14 which has had an impact on the number and types of service available to the public. The fall in spending and the disproportionate impact on different geographical regions could mean we are faced with haves and have-nots in our library provision. Local authorities must be cognizant of this when making spending decisions. Investment in libraries should not be seen in isolation but as a part of a broader strategy to deliver community and economic benefit."
