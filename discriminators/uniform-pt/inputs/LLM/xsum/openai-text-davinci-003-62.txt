xth minute of a keenly contested match at Moses Mabhida Stadium.

"From my experience, this is one of scenarios where details decide a game, not only at one moment but from the beginning.

"The entire mindset and decisions of players subjected to this level of competition is so important, and can really decide a game and the tournament as a whole.

"We have to take all these details into consideration, starting now before the next game."

Having started the tournament with a hard-fought draw against Uganda, Micho and his team will now look to bounce back in their second Group A game against Ghana on Thursday, 7 July in the coastal city of Port Elizabeth.

The Ghanaians, who boast more than six players occupying spots in the English Premiership and many more around Europe, have also dropped points in their opening game - going down 1-0 against Mali - and will now also be desperate for a result.

But Micho is adamant that his side must not be preoccupied with the opponents and should instead simply focus on what’s required from the South Africans if they are to lift the trophy next month.

“We must concentrate on our performance rather than that of the opponent," he said.

"My instructions to my players are not to think about the opposition, but rather how we need to approach the game and how we prepare for it. This is important in order for us to perform our best."

The match will be broadcast live on SABC 1 from 17h00.
