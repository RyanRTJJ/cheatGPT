 finals.

Moulin took a point to help the Crusaders win in Brisbane before Saturday's final.

He said the Crusaders were set to be in the second stage of a three-leg series in which they will clash against the Broncos, Lions and Redblacks ahead of a friendly on May 18.

"If there's a game, we'll talk next Thursday because they came here to take control, so hopefully they can be that," said the former Celtic and Sharks academy centre.

"If they lose, we'll talk about it."

Hogg is not in contention for a place after he has gone to the Broncos for an early 2016 season start.

He won the try against Tonga on Saturday in what was hailed as the finest try possible.

"It's such a different team right now," Hogg said.

"I'm really looking forward to it and wanting to get to Brisbane - but as far as the challenge, it's different, it's different. This was a very different team.

"We've got to keep going."

Giridole hopes another penalty penalty means he will have to make up ground.

Tonga coach Paul Konerko praised the Crusaders' victory as a strong return to form.

"I'm happy for the Crusaders for their return to form," Konerko said.

"A lot of teams come here and want to do good things and give their fans hope for the game.

"If we can do that the Crusaders will be successful in it and come back to a new format."

Wine is among Hogg's strengths.

Konerko said the forward had had success as a winger in the early stages of rugby league but has never had the opportunity to put into his game as a full-back.

"I think we can play a lot of different games out of our box," he said.

"It's got to come together and the Crusaders are great and fantastic players and are going to be very well tested this year at a very difficult time."

Hogg said he felt in better condition when he made his return to the team and that could continue this
