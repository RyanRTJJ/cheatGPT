 short-lived, localised illness but can cause serious complications in individuals and in the birth process. For example, symptoms include a rash, headache and fatigue. While the virus usually doesn't spread among people in healthy pregnancies, pregnant women shouldn't travel to regions under threat. Zika has been linked to birth defects in mothers during pregnancy but officials don't know yet whether Zika can cause microcephaly. Zika can only be spread by the Anopheles mosquito species native to the Americas.

'Diseases are not going away'

The virus was first identified in August in Brazil and in neighbouring countries following years of surveillance and aerial spraying of a massive dengue crop.

Brazil was then hit by the worst epidemic in the country since 1952, when millions of people died of leptospirosis caused by the bird-tooth mosquito and was decimated by the disease.

There are currently no new outbreaks of Zika and experts doubt this will be the last one, as some local populations recover while others die.

There have been no reports of the Zika virus spreading after being carried to pregnant women in other countries.

"Diseases that we haven't even had the time to understand are causing serious health problems and they are not going away," said Dr. Thomas Frieden, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"We all still have the ability to take immediate action to protect ourselves and those around us."

The World Health Organisation announced on Thursday that there'd be extra funding for Zika research in Brazil when it is approved by lawmakers on Wednesday.

Dr John Ioel, from University College London, said there's little chance of catching Zika after all the efforts to stop it.

"We've had almost three months of intense political work and the political pressure is just going to continue to get stronger," he said.

"All the same, there will be more and more cases after all this."
