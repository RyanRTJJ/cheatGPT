 on young people without supervision.

Many of them took to forums where underage minors advertise for free tattoos, posing their designs on the backs of their arms.

One of the girls who advertised on a forum told undercover investigators that her clients often offered to deliver their images to anyone who would sign a release document authorizing him or her to pay for the tattoo, which costs anywhere from $15 to $40.

On Facebook, the group's tag line reads: "We all agree: If we look like us, we can kill people!" It includes several photos of the girls with their faces covered.

"My dream is to be an Army officer so I can wear my country's logo on my back, but I won't wear my mom's. I will make my own art tattoo."

They posted photos from their website about them holding up an Army flag, the group's motto, and a tattoo they bought from Amazon.com of soldiers in an empty field.

One group on Instagram posted photos holding a groupie's hand and giving out free tattoos to people. Another posted a quote from the movie The Expendables in one photo, and a third gave a quote from the TV show Breaking Bad.

But their parents were unaware of their activities, which may be an intentional ploy to draw teens into the sex trade.

While none were arrested or even accused of working for the cartel, a Texas grand jury later indicted them on federal charges that led to their incarceration.
