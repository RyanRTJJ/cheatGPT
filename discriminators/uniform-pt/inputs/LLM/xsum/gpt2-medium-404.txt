 20,000 feet and performing an elaborate preflight dance moves to impress the customers.

Video shot in the cloud by the drone's onboard cameras shows the drone pilot fly the drones to a "customer" who arrives to pick up the package. The customer leaves the shop, pays, hops on the drone or uses hand gestures to select the item, before the package reaches its destination in a box.

According to the company, the delivery drone is capable of delivering large loads of packages in the future but its most recent delivery was the largest package, approximately 1 kg of silver worth approximately $25.

In the video, the customers can be seen walking around the delivery drone, making eye contact with the customers while posing for the camera. A similar "selfie" could be done with a smartphone app such as Instagram, which is often used in this way in order to promote new products and services.

In order to avoid accidents, drone delivery is designed into the drone's operating instructions. "Ridiculous deliveries should be banned from future commercial use, including aerial aerial deliveries," the company says.

The company plans to make use of some of the expertise it acquired over 50 years ago and has created a drone delivery service "sister to Deliveroo". There is an additional option called Fly to Delivery, where a customer has to give his/her own personal details in order to be flown by the drone, while the customer can be invited to be part of the pilot and are told as the package lands that they will be followed by the drone.
