Mr Tinsley said both had suffered with depression before but had not been treated.

'He was a very bright kid but has not had the treatment he needs for his depression,' he said.

Mr Tinsley said police have spent seven hours speaking to the teenager but they still did not have a suspect.

'He is still being spoken to and we are trying to develop CCTV but they have seen him earlier and they didn't apprehend him,' he said.

'There was some movement earlier which we can't pin to a particular incident. There could have been some kind of altercation.'

The boy told his mother he planned on meeting a friend in his home town on Thursday and heading to a nearby restaurant.

He failed to turn up for the scheduled meeting at around 1pm.

Police have launched a critical incident investigation this afternoon and the suspect has now been taken into custody.

Police have today begun cordoning off the area immediately surrounding the scene where the girl, who is 13 and is a pupil at nearby King's College, was reported missing.

It is still unclear whether anyone else was in the area at the time.
