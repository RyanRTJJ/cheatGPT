 "alarming breakdown" of the standards in England, in particular in schools. Here are how we feel, as informed observers:

Some of the damning findings that Ofsted discovered in September – which include a failure to allow girls "to feel encouraged" – have been corrected.

Some school buildings in schools where students were reported to have complained to Ofsted have been taken over by inspectors in recent years. However, the schools are usually not inspected.

Ofsted says, however, that there have been a number of cases of alleged bias incidents. It says those incidents tend to "raise questions about whether decisions about changes and improvements are being made with fairness and integrity".

Some Ofsted inspectors found the conditions in some of the schools to be particularly poor – including in one in a residential house.

And some investigations into alleged problems appear to have gone ahead according to Ofsted's strict standards.

Are those inspections still required and how do you feel about them?

Ofsted wants all schools in England to be subject to quality checks, and every school, as an independent body, to follow these guidelines.

The changes will make Ofsted a more transparent regulator.

It will also establish a new directorate which will examine schools and establish any failings uncovered

The new directorate will be an independent trust of which Ofsted is one member, but Ofsted recognises that other people will have different views

Ofsted will give clear direction to schools: which inspectors will assess each school and which issues on any particular school's file should not be judged.

It is intended to work for a period up to about the period after December 2014

As well as having an advisory role, the directorate will oversee the investigation by Ofsted into every school that is subject to Ofsted.

This is designed to ensure schools are well run so they can be judged accurately before school starts

A separate department, known as the Quality and Standards Department, will be created to assess individual schools.

But Ofsted is also calling for more people to work
