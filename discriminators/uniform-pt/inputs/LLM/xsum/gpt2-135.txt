 of the transfer, Liverpool would have a bid of £4.5million for the 23-year-old.

Lampard has yet to receive any offers to go north through the Super League, and it had been rumoured that Manchester City and Tottenham would also be interested in the player. Liverpool are said to be actively pursued by other clubs despite their recent departures.

Aborah has played all 14 Premier League games this season, with 10 of these coming against the West Ham, West Ham United and Fulham, making him one of the most prolific full-backs in league history. The Belgian defender has made 11 total appearances for Liverpool since arriving in June 2009.

Lampard could join out of contract at the end of 2013 before returning with club for a further two seasons. He played 22% of Liverpool's League Cup matches, with 14 interceptions and six goals.
