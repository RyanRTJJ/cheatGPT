Criminals, police, and charities have launched a trial to catch bike thieves using mobile phones.

The Universities' Police Science Institute (Upsi) in Cardiff ran a trial in London to warn about thieves on bikes stealing mobile phones.

The #Copcat trial with the Metropolitan Police aimed to stop thieves in the capital using a device known as a "Copcat".

The device is placed on top of the bike handlebars to act as a "listening device."

"People don't understand that when they do something to get someone's attention, they're actually actually getting themselves robbed," said Tom Foxx, Upsi's associate director.

"Police just want any excuse to use their mobile devices. It's the quickest phone call, it's the easiest police response."

The Met used the device to catch two men who had been robbing people at random on bicycles.

They stopped in a bike lane, and watched the suspects put a device on a bike handle.

"They put a metal device on a chain which had a radio transmitter in it. It looked suspicious, so they removed it and ran off," said Detective Constable Steve Pacey from the Met's bike unit.

"The device is designed to act as a listening device," Foxx said.

"It looks sort of like a piece of black plastic, and you would never expect that it was listening. It makes phone calls or sends text messages, but it looks like it is just hanging on the handlebars.

"[If] someone rings their mobile or their sat-nav, they won't realize what's happening till the call has gone through."

Officers placed two devices on the first suspect's bike.

"Within two minutes of receiving the call on the first device being activated, the suspect fled the scene," said Detective Constable Pacey.

The Met believes it can stop bike thefts with the device in under three minutes of someone receiving a distress call.

Last year, four people were robbed with a
