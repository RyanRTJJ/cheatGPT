The World Health Organization lists the disease as a worldwide problem.

The group urged countries to take steps to help control ticks and boost the prevalence of tick control technologies used in both agriculture and forestry.

Cynthia McAndrew, a spokeswoman for the Lyme Project in Seattle, said an active Lyme outbreak in the state this year has been the world's second-most unusual in at least a generation. A 2014 study by the Pacific Northwest Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggested the number of sick people, from patients to livestock, is at least twice as high in the state.

McAndrew said the Lyme disease is on track to reach its highest level since the 2009 outbreak in Massachusetts, and ticks could continue to spread Lyme disease into 2016 at the same rate.

The Lyme Foundation of Washington is working with Washington state officials and with members of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to develop an anti-tick product and develop tick control practices.

The BLS estimate is part of a broader tick count that it said has risen dramatically in the past year.

In the past three years, the state's tick population has increased nearly 800 per cent, the agency said, while its total number of ticks has dwindled from 1.1 million in 2008 to 0.8 million at the end of 2012.

Males can kill up to 20 per cent of ticks during a winter â€” a fact that has raised concern about whether and how ticks affect people.

Ticks generally start out on humans with Lyme disease, but spread to other people. That's when the symptoms are devastating.

Ticks also can cause a variety of other illnesses, such as headaches, migraines, arthralgias and skin rash. Ticks can also infect humans
