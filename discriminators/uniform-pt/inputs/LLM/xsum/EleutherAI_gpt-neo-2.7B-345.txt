 been made over the weekend of two people seen on a horse near the prison.

The FBI are now taking over the investigation of the prison, after the police declined to do so. Federal officials are also investigating who was behind the plot and were warned last week that there could be an attempted prison break. The US prison is holding more than 2,000 prisoners, with close to 5,000 held at other prisons elsewhere in the country.

If you live in Ohio or want to help, there is now a petition set up on Change.org by the Ohio Coalition to Protect Correctional Facilities to "Free Shante and all of the Women Prisoners incarcerated in the prison in Pennsylvania." Their aim is to bring attention to the case and put pressure on the prison officials so that the case can be re-opened. They also want to raise awareness by making sure the public is aware of the incident and the possible risks they are posing to themselves and the public with their risky behaviour. "The women inmates will not be released into society without knowing their situation with the help of the FBI, the US Marshalls Office and the CDC," they say.

The group says this is not the first time such a plot has been made. "The women that were involved in this prison break will not get a second chance. They will forever be convicted of a sex crime that they did not commit, and they will have to be in prison for the rest of their lives. We need immediate help from all politicians and the general public to bring these women justice," their statement reads.

I am a female and we are still fighting to abolish this evil act by the state and these evil people. Our fight to abolish the death penalty does not stop. Let's start the global anti-sex crime movement and let's make sure every one is informed when this disgusting incident
