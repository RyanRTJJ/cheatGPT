 Queen Victoria, as her longest reigning monarch, with 93 years.
 Queen Elizabeth II’s reign as Queen of England and Empress of India has given her an important role – and one perhaps unprecedented in centuries. Her role in world history will be reflected in the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in late 2013, her Diamond Jubilee in 2012, and for much of her reign, her State Visit to the United States. In a time of political upheaval, Queen Elizabeth II continues to offer calm and insight. In a time of change, she offers stability, respect, and, most of all, respect, to all people and nations.

In the United Kingdom, where this book was first published, Queen Elizabeth II is referred to as Her Majesty, often by her subjects and her staff. Where the term Her Majesty (or HM) is reserved for the sovereign and her family, Elizabeth II is simply Her Majesty, particularly when addressing the media or addressing dignitaries. In such instances, she gives her name as Elizabeth II, commonly called Liz by those in the media and by those who seek to connect her to The Queen Elizabeth II.

As Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II is the official representative of Her Majesty The Queen, Crown Princess Victoria, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, Earl Spencer, their immediate family, and the British State. She is the head of the royal household and, since June 2011, the head of the Commonwealth, having succeeded her mother as Queen. Her duties are divided between the government, the Royal Family, civil society, and the Commonwealth.

At her side are her two consorts: Princess Anne, who is the Official Assay of Her Majesty’s Person and works as Her Majesty’s Principal Private Secretary, and Camilla, who serves as Her Majesty’s Official Assistant to the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. The Queen and her consorts have the rank of ambassador; a junior minister and junior ambassador in private life rank below them; and the Queen’s Personal Assistant, Lady Seager, who reports solely to her, and serves the dual role of royal confidant and personal assistant.
