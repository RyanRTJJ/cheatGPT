Although it may be necessary to avoid excessive exposure to excess sodium in order to maintain adequate sodium balance, a general rule of thumb remains:

Sodium may cause anemia if it's above a certain amount.


If there are large changes in the food quality, there is a chance that the excess sodium may be converted to salt because of electrolyte changes.

Inadequate sodium can be detrimental to healthy bone and organs. Low sodium status can lead to osteoporosis, ulcerative colitis, diabetes mellitus, and kidney stones. In general, the better the blood supply to calcium, there might be better calcium concentration at high calcium intakes.


The problem with excessive levels of sodium, in combination with high calcium intakes, includes urinary water retention, electrolyte disturbances, and the following:

High sodium blood pressure (salt has a higher pH than water).

Hormone disposal, including blood-releasing hormones that activate potassium and calcium ions, decreases blood sodium levels.

Low plasma concentrations of calcium, such as calcium monohydrate, which are able to induce renal calcium absorption by reducing renal potassium absorption.

Poor renal function (diabetes mellitus) or abnormal levels of potassium.

Osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus of the circulatory system.

High sodium intakes (including sodium-rich foods) lead to hyponatraemia. The syndrome has been classified by the American College of Cardiology into hyponatraemia and pericarditis in 18 of the first 20 states and one-third of countries. In general, more severe cases of hyponatraemia can be experienced when certain drugs or high-potency drugs are used excessively.

Achieving optimal sodium balance requires a combination of two different priorities:

Sodium balance needs to increase to maintain adequate sodium balance.


. Sulfur levels need to get to the best levels.

Excessive sodium can cause hyponatraemia, a condition in which water retention in the kidneys leads
