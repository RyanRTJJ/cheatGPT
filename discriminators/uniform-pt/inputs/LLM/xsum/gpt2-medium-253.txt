 decision to grant planning permission to the firm to develop shale gas at the well site due to environmental concerns about air quality and water contamination. The hearing into the project also examined how North Yorkshire Council had dealt with the "serious and serious breach of its own environmental laws" by allowing the work at Kirby Misperton to go ahead despite the environmental concerns raised by residents who felt the work posed environmental hazards. Dr. Simon Reisman, of Friends of the Earth, said: "For decades we in the energy landscape have been saying that an unspoilt environment is the best way forward. This is not true; it is impossible to avoid causing damage and increasing pollution with shale gas as well as other renewables. We understand people will disagree with the conclusions we make, but to ignore significant evidence suggests that this issue is far from settled." North Yorkshire councillor Jonathan Ashby was appointed energy and climate change spokesman for the Labour party as it campaigned for a green economy in November. Mr Ashby, the MP for Streatham, said Labour's campaign was based around its commitment to the environment. He added: "This is the future of the Labour party. We accept climate change and need to do everything we can to meet it â€“ now." David Cameron welcomed the decision by North Yorkshire Council but called on the government to take action over other areas which it wants to introduce including proposals for a cap on carbon emissions. David Cameron told parliament: "But this is too little too late, and the government would do well to remember this." "The government must now put on hold any new green development in a way which allows both the NHS and our economy to grow with energy efficiency and renewable sources." Mr Cameron has called for a moratorium on new buildings in Britain's most highly populated cities. His proposals range from a ban on new buildings from developing in the capital to restrictions on building up to 400 new homes in a single area to cut housing costs and help the environment.
