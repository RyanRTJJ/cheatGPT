 "safe and secure" prison – especially because of staffing shortages across the rest of the Ministry of Justice – and a decision to build a £7m (€8.52m/US$10.36m) new prison on top of HMP Elm Guesthouse in Wiltshire could lead to more problems.

Prisoner numbers in England and Wales have topped 1,000 for the first time in 20 years and ministers are considering raising numbers for prison reforms or moving prisoners to the mainland.

HM Inspectorate of Prisons said it was not alone in criticising the government for not taking a long-term view because the number of prisoners remained "uncomfortably high". It said there were "no discernible changes" to the system.

"Although the numbers of prisoners have declined, we do not feel the prison population is on a downward trend in England and Wales," said the report.

"We do not believe the system has had a major impact on the risk of violence in the community."

The HM Inspector of Prisons report also said, in response to concerns from MPs about the number of staff being cut and concerns about a lack of resources, the number of prison officers in England and Wales would be reduced by half by 2020.

It said the number of prison officers would be reduced by an average of 29 in each year since 2012, in line with the plans already published by the Government and that could be made up by recruiting more staff from local authorities or the voluntary sector.

The HM Inspectorate has expressed concern before about the Ministry of Justice "failing" on its plans to introduce work-based rehabilitation and to increase education qualifications.

"HM Prison & Probation (Prison Governance & Safety) is very concerned by new proposals to increase the number of the voluntary, prison-based training awards such as the Prison Service Award (PSA) to 14,500 and a further increase in the number of training courses to be held in-prison," said the HM Inspectorate.

"There is concern that this will lead to the current level of prison staff numbers having to accept fewer training courses."

Prison officers in England and Wales are under threat of job cuts and in other prisons
