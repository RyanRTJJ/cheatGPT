 the island of Eigg moves entirely online.

In 2008 the Scottish Government estimated Eigg would cost around £8.5million a year to run. But a more recent estimate, to be made in April this year, is that the running costs could be lower than the previous estimate, in line with the cost of maintaining an average Scottish community.

The new Eigg website was launched yesterday to allow locals and visitors to explore an island that some consider to hold a treasure trove of evidence as to when islands were more often visited by sea peoples.

A survey of around 80 ancient standing stones and other features - believed to be from ancient sites - revealed that up to 5,000 years ago, as part of the first island culture, they were visited by sea people who may have been the first settlers.

Today, around 300 people live on Eigg, but that number is set to drop to around 140 - about half its current population.

With the island having only two buses available each way, the new plan is to take it out of the Highlands and into Wales.

The council hope to make a decision by the end of November or early December, and if successful, will start advertising for contractors at the end of year.

The island’s new website will include pictures of each of the features found on the island, and details on what the council believes each feature tells about the people and the communities of the past.

It will highlight the importance of finding out what is on your island before it is taken away.

The website will also include information for local businesses, a timeline of past and present residents, historic maps and stories on the island, and links for school and college students interested in history.

If you were to visit Eigg now, or even if you weren’t, you could get an idea of what this island of a
