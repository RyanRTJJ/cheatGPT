 cause a host of emotional and financial problems.

The group, working with the Care Quality Commission and the Care Services Commission, asked the public to donate toiletries and clothes for people suffering with ill health.

The toiletries will be distributed on behalf of the charity to those who need them for their day to day life, and the clothes will go to the same people but have been donated by members of the public.

The survey found people who have chronic conditions like MS, or those suffering from the debilitating effects of cancer, would struggle to find clothes and toiletries if they were sick.

In a statement, Mr Taylor said: “We’ve always known that one in four people in the UK would consider themselves to be living with long-term physical or mental health problems, but it’s taken us a long time to uncover that statistic. What used to be a minor problem which could be managed in the short term is now a crippling disorder that causes stress for some and impacts on everyone’s day-to-day life.

“It’s great to see the public and business working together to help with this, but it shows that if we’re not actively helping people with disabilities to manage their conditions, people suffer as a result.”

According to the study, the top three items people want to donate to those living with ill physical health is underwear, underclothing such as swimwear, and t-shirts.

The top items people want to donate to those experiencing life-limiting or chronic mental health problems are socks, slippers, toiletry sets, and T-shirts.

A third of older people experience difficulty with dressing and undressing when suffering with mental health problems such as dementia, depression and anxiety, the research showed.

Mr Tayor added: “We hear time and time again how the people living with long-term illnesses have such a tough time trying to deal with their conditions with everyday items like socks and t-shirts making life a lot easier.

“We need to find ways to offer people with long-term conditions a helping hand, not just to relieve physical pain, but to ensure their everyday quality of life is as good as possible
