 the criminals when they were confronted. There were seven arrests, including a boy aged 14 and a man aged 19.

A 16-year-old boy, believed to have been involved in the incident, was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of shooting with intent to endanger life and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.

The BBC's Jonny Dymond in Cardiff said it was the first time a teenager had been picked up in south Wales for firearms offences. He said it came after a month of gun violence in Cardiff, South Wales' capital and most populous city.

A man was left injured in separate shooting in Cardiff on Thursday night, but he is said to be in a stable condition.

All the injured have since been discharged from hospital.

Police Commissioner Dave Thompson described the spate of shootings as "unfortunate and upsetting" and urged residents to work with them.

The shooting in Long Lane comes three days after a 19-year-old was wounded on Plasey Drive in Cardiff.

There have been three shootings in Wrexham this month - the first on 14 February, another on 16 February and a third on 1 March.

Police believe the firearms may have been supplied by organised crime gangs operating across the south Wales area.

Mr Thompson said there had been a "significant shift in criminal culture" across south Wales.

"We are seeing the beginning of a new era, which can only be a worry to those wishing to make life difficult for public officers, members of the public and to people within the community," he said.

"We will continue to do our best to protect all members of our community, whether they are involved in crime or not."

Det Ch Insp Chris Griffiths said: "We're doing everything we can to bring violent criminals to justice and ensure we continue to prevent harm.

"We want to have the public's support to do this - if they are involved in criminal activity of any kind, please consider
