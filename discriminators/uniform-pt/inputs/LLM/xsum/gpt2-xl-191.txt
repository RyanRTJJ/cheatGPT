 Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) reported that more than 1,500 members had voted to strike.

In a statement the TSSA said that workers at 12 North West main line maintenance companies would walk out between Sunday, June 3 and Sunday, June 17 between 8am and 5pm.

"The management of [the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO)] companies have threatened to impose a new contract which would be much tougher and take a lot more out of their employees," TSSA regional organiser Nick Fidler said.

MRO companies include Amey, Southern, BTS London Midland, BTP North Yorkshire and Arriva Trains Wales. Staff at five of the companies had voted to do industrial action this week.

Amey was planning to impose a new contract that would not have reduced wages for new employees and would also freeze the retirement age for staff across all divisions, the TSSA said.

The TSSA is understood to be seeking legal advice on whether to take its industrial action to the High Court, citing the controversial Railways Act 2004 which grants Railtrack considerable power to impose new contracts on MRO providers. It is also seeking clarification from Transport for London (TfL) regarding its interpretation of the law.

"The unions have been saying for a long time that MRO arrangements are unacceptable and we're pleased to finally see evidence that it's true," said TSSA general secretary Mick Cash. "It was never a question of if our members would strike but when."
