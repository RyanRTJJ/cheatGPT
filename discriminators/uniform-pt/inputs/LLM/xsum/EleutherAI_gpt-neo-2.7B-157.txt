“S.E.I.A.L. (S.E.I.A.L.)” is written under the image, the newspaper reported. The initials stand for the Brazilian government’s system of state-run social security, which offers benefits to retirees.

A message posted on Facebook, which could not immediately be verified, said the incident occurred in July but that the culprit is still being chased.

The city of Rio de Janeiro has become an increasingly tense battleground where police struggle with a large drug problem. The city has also become the site of many protests by anti-government demonstrators, with some police officers said to have been killed.

Brazilian authorities have vowed to combat illegal protests before the Olympics, which open in Rio on Friday. Earlier this week, they made plans to deploy 300 additional security officers, including about 1,400 mounted police and 2,800 plainclothes officers, to help in security efforts.

Police have said that demonstrators will have to show identification to enter the main Olympic venues for the games. The Associated Press news agency reported Thursday that security forces will make “an open-ended offer” to allow protesters into the stadiums.
