 of criticism, from animal rights organisations to MPs, when it emerged how the Welsh government had granted a licence to a third party organisation in 2015 to kill the animal. It has now emerged that the company was called Green Flag, which is also responsible for killing animals in India. Police said they had contacted the company and asked it to submit a "definitive proposal" for the operation to be carried out, but they were not happy and so decided to remove it.

Mr Boles said Green Flag did not ask to be involved in the fox hunt, but that the animal could not be euthanased humanely. "To kill a fox-hybrid that had been kept as a pet since it was a puppy – with only a wire chain restraining it – was an unjustifiable decision," he said. "It was unnecessary and it only fuelled our desire to see the foxhunt stopped altogether for the sake of the animal's welfare. "As a local councillor, it was entirely foreseeable that killing an animal like this would cause outrage and condemnation. But there were no plans to do so under the previous Hunting Act and with the threat of legal action still hanging over them, the hunts have refused to consider alternatives." A hunt spokesman said: "It is disappointing that when confronted with the facts surrounding the culling of the fox-hybrid, the council leadership still chose to proceed with the plan – not the one of killing the animal at the earliest opportunity possible. "The council have also been clear that we will continue with our legal duty to respond if there is a complaint and work within the law to bring the individuals in to account. The final decision to shoot the fox-hybrid was made in consultation with the Welsh Government and Welsh Government Agencies and in line with animal welfare principles and best practice guidance. "We have seen some extremely serious allegations involving poor care of animals at the previous hunt. These must be fully investigated before it goes ahead."
