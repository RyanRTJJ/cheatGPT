 Barcelona, Spain, and, as is tradition, there will be a number of F1 fans in attendance at the track. This year, the track has yet to be renamed and, until that happens, the 'Catalan street circuits' will be, for the most part, untouched. But when we do get to Barcelona, remember that Barcelona is a beautiful city, and its street circuits are quite spectacular.

Almeria – a classic track, although there are some tricky corners, but many are very good

Donington Park – a great track and not so much challenging

Nippon Silverstone – a classic track, with good corners, although not many of them are very
