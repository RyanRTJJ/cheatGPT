 Jeddah in the western direction and the car in which they were travelling came up behind them.

We all were getting onto the highway at full speed, I was driving in the right lane. I hit the gas pedal and my car went into the shoulder of the road, its windows didn't open. If you're inside it, it's not your world. At that time I couldn't see any of my children. I saw a crowd of people standing by a road with other vehicles trying to get out of the way.

They asked whether the traffic had slowed down. When I showed them our speed they said that wasn't true and let us through. They let us through. I don't know what they told them but they let us past. There was one minute of waiting for them, which was the longest I've ever waited in Jeddah.

And I haven't ever seen any
