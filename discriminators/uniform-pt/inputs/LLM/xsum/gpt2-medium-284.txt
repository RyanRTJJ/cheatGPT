 The change that would change the rules from right up to left-turn will make it mandatory to give way to cyclists going straight ahead while on the road.

"This is the first of some five steps it could go on over the next few years. It may come after the H.E for Ontario passes the legislation through the legislature," said Tom Leung, executive director of the Coalition for Cycle Safety, in an interview with Cycling Canada.

Liang said that while the bill has wide support in the House, it's a bit late to start a bike-sharing program despite its popularity. He urged people to support the Bill in the Senate after the H.M.P. is able to make the necessary adjustments.

"Cycling is great. More than 100,000 Canadians cycle daily," said Leung, adding that cycling needs the help of cars not cyclists at present. "There are hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenues by cyclists every year due to collisions and crashes. By giving right of way to bicyclists, it gives a very significant economic incentive to continue cycling."

Leung added that there are a number of positive things about this law, including improvements in safety, while also discouraging driver abuse when turning left after a right in the middle of the highway.

He also pointed out that the law in fact gives people an indication about whether they're going to be using the bike sharing program.

"A right-turning driver is going to be able to drive right alongside you. So when [they] don't have a right to turn the other way you automatically have a right to pass them," said Leung, before adding the new version of the "right-turn" law will take effect this June.

Hilary Drennan, the executive director of the Canadian Cycling Federation, told Cycling Canada the legislation is "ambitious and overdue." But she added if this had happened before in Ottawa, or anywhere else, there "would have been much less uproar" about the changes.

The legislation would also provide provincial governments with the power to enforce "safe operation" laws and allow for
