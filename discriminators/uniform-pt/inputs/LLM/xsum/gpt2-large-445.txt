 mice were being housed in the unit but no evidence of human contamination was found in the mice's food, so it was not a health risk. "Our experts have assessed the strain of the virus and have decided there is no risk of human exposure at this time," it said in a statement. "However we are taking the outbreak seriously, taking steps to improve precautions throughout the unit and in the hospital. All patients treated with influenza in the unit are isolated, and we are in the process of securing all remaining supplies." The UK and global health warnings for people in the UK, the US, France and Germany, have been lifted. Public health officials have said many of the infections are unconnected to the recent pandemic virus which has hit Europe, Canada and the eastern hemisphere. One of the infected hospital patients on the unit at UHW was a 16-year-old girl and she has recovered. Dr Stuart Boulton, consultant infectious disease specialist in the emergency department at UHW, said he's seen a lot of flu and he was not aware of anything like the outbreak of flu the last few days. Dr Boulton said the hospital is working with the UHW health board on how the risk of flu is being managed in the unit.

"We will be taking the latest advice about the vaccine in the hospital. We are very supportive and will remain so," he added. All the infected hospital patients have now gone home and are feeling well enough to go home.

But one patient, a 64-year-old hospital visitor who did not wish to be named, said they were quarantined and would not be allowed back in for up to 90 days. Her hospital visit the day before had also had no infections, an official from the health board said. Another patient who had a very serious flu infection, died the day after returning from the hospital, the official said. The two visitors are "in our thoughts and prayers", according to health board officials,
