 custody, leading police to have him repeatedly restrained and shackled after being arrested, and the charges of murder and manslaughter will be replaced with second-degree charges, meaning charges will not be brought until the death is proven in court.

Police Chief Jim Johnson told lawmakers outside Baltimore City Hall that the case has been handed over to the State's Attorney's Office for review. He said he expects the office to "do due diligence" in its review.

Police union chairman Gene Ryan said the police department's internal investigation is complete and there is "absolutely no basis" for the state's attorney's office to pursue additional charges.

"This incident was a tragic accident and any conclusions drawn by the independent police review board or whatever the outcome is - and that is what we'll all find out - is completely separate from this investigation," Ryan said. "It's a different thing that they're looking at."

A new lawsuit was filed on December 7th, along with a second lawsuit, charging the city and police with an unconstitutional use of force and claiming Gray's death was unnecessary and excessive. Police have denied wrongdoing.

The police union said it was prepared to work with the Justice Department on reforms, but questioned its impartiality.
