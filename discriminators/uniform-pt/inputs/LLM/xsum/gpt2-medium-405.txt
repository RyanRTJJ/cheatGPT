 chance to compete for a Champions League place next season

I'm looking forward to the challenges ahead and we'll look to play a more advanced style of football next term," said Hibernian boss Danny Wilson.

"Every season there are some disappointing performances in the Premier League but I think that we were extremely fortunate to finish second to Manchester United in the table in the Premier League.

"We've won the Premier League twice in the last three years so I certainly think we should take those achievements as a credit towards next season but it will be more important that we continue to improve if we are ever going to finish in the top four."

It was the seventh time they've been relegated this season by one point or worse.

The Red Devils lost 2-0 at Preston and 2-0 at St Johnstone last weekend, having fallen behind 1-0 to Manchester United at Goodison Park.

"For me, it felt disappointing to finish second with a win the week before as I wanted to show my belief and focus to our players," said Wilson.

Hibernian have had to fight their way back through the divisions for the past 13 years and were promoted last season - they finished third.

But their progress has been affected by a string of defeats, starting with a 3-1 defeat to Bournemouth on 18 August.

They also had to settle for a goalless draw against Stoke City and then a 1-0 victory at Millwall on Sunday, their fifth defeat in their past six games together.

Wilson's side are now five points behind second-placed St Johnstone and in second-bottom Motherwell, a position they will be hoping for their second consecutive win on Saturday as they remain without a win in all but five matches.

It has been a tough and emotional final weeks for the club, with several players going off injured and many injured players leaving during the month leading up to the derby.
