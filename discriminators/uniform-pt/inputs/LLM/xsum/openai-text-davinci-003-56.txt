 the car in Huntington Beach, California a few days before it went missing.

Strickland said he was very shocked.

"I stopped for like a second and I was like, there's no way," he said. "It's like seeing a ghost."

His father, David Strickland, said the car had been in their family for two generations.

"I'm so happy. This has brought us all back together," he said.

The car was discovered on Wednesday, more than 400 miles away in the small Northern California town of Willows.

According to Willows police, an officer was patrolling in the area and noticed the vehicle parked illegally in front of a home. He ran the vehicle's license plate and discovered it was reported stolen in June.

Police knocked on the door, but no one answered. They then contacted the home's owner, who said he had rented the house to a couple from Culver City, California.

Police said the couple had driven the car to Willows and then abandoned it.

The Stricklands were able to get the car back, but it is in rough shape. It has broken windows, a damaged interior and significant cosmetic damage.

The Stricklands are now in the process of getting the car fixed up, which will be a costly endeavor.

The couple that abandoned the car has not been identified. The Stricklands said they plan to press charges and hope to get the car back in its original condition.

"I just hope they learned their lesson," Gavin Strickland said. "You just don't stealing somebody's car."
