• Strengthening the Welsh voice in Westminster, fighting for greater powers and standing in solidarity with Scotland in the struggle for reform of the UK.

• Prioritising action on the climate emergency, including decisive policies on economic and social justice, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and active travel at the heart of Welsh government. 

• Securing fair funding for Wales, so that it is not bearing the brunt of austerity and is not left behind as the rest of the UK recovers from the pandemic. 

• Protecting Wales’s natural environment, and with it, our health and well being. 

• Investing in the future of Wales by targeting money towards education, skills and enterprise.

• Giving the people of Wales more direct democracy and a fairer electoral system. 

• Opposing divisive, right-wing policies that would further damage our communities. 

• Challenging Westminster’s austerity agenda and its continued attack on social security.

• Combating racism, homophobia, sexism and all other forms of discrimination.
