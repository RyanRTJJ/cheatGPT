 to make it an offence to picket a place of work. If enacted a member would face a fine of up to £5,000 or four years in prison if convicted.

Smith said: “It is essential that a large membership campaign is mounted to oppose this threat to fundamental rights of workers.”

The government is also expected this month to table a White Paper on workers’ rights in the EU, which will be followed by separate legislation at the same time as the Trade Union bill.

Smith urged Scottish ministers to support efforts to prevent the new laws being used to breach rights to picket at Scotland’s airports, and to provide further support to local unions seeking to defend their members’ rights. He added: “If the Scottish government supports workers’ rights it is absolutely vital that it do so now.”

The government will also be under pressure to increase the fines and prison terms faced by those convicted of picketing during the passage of the legislation.

• This article was amended on 26 January 2014 to clarify that a Scottish government spokesperson said that the government had only made a general statement on the issue and said that it was not taking a position. An earlier version said that the government had not been in contact; it had been in contact but said that no statement could be made yet, due to the impending vote in parliament. This article was amended to make clear that the UK ministers will be introducing the new law, not the Scottish parliament’s Justice and Public Safety committee. The headline, “Scottish gov to decide fate of pickets”, has been corrected to “Scottish gov to decide fate of pickets”. The article was further amended to remove the reference to the Scottish trade unionist Stephen Nolan, who has been imprisoned in England for picketing an airport against the government’s advice. This has been amended to simply “Scottish labour laws”. The original photograph accompanying the article has been amended to include the GMB on the picket line.
