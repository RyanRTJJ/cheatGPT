 available or it can lead to fluid in the body being lost in the urine. The oral hearings into the deaths of five children began in 2004. Hyponatraemia is an abnormally low level of sodium in the blood that can occur when fluid is not available or it can lead to fluid in the body being lost in the urine.

Athletes with the disease may develop a loss of energy and muscle strength, muscle weakness and paralysis, and may suffer from high fever. At times, they've suffered brain damage as well. Some children may die from encephalopathy, or sudden death of the brain. Others develop seizures. And of those that survive, experts have found many children with symptoms similar to those suffered by children with a brain disease called encephalomyopathy.

After the hearing, a panel of physicians and researchers will analyze what medical interventions the child may have received to correct the problem. The panel may take testimony from the child's family or people with expertise in the medical field, and from representatives of state organizations overseeing education around hyponatraemia, as well as researchers from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other organizations.

The committee will hear testimony and view medical evidence from the start until it makes recommendations to the FDA, the US Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies in February, 2015. That will be the time in which the FDA could approve a vaccine or drug for the condition, although an agency spokesperson said an advisory will be filed with the FDA "as soon as we are ready."
