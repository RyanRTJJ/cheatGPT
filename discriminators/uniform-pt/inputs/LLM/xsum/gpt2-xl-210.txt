 Kent police noted two failings, they said.

The child was given food only a few times a day and he was not given enough to drink. He suffered from extreme constipation when he was put in foster care.

The report said it was only after a social worker met Baby Imran twice in 2015 when a problem was first identified within the family.

The report, to mark the anniversary of Baby Imran's death, said: "There was no evidence of any ongoing support needs from the family, including health needs and education needs, due to the lack of a coherent social service plan."

The report praised social workers for acting swiftly to resolve a problem at the family home in Walthamstow, east London, and highlighted improvements on welfare measures since the report came out.

After the inquest in January 2014, two relatives, the boy's father Zeeshan Ahmed, and his father's live-in girlfriend, Gulamah Akram, both denied charges of causing the death by child cruelty. They have since pleaded guilty and received community sentences.

The report said the police and social services response to the toddler's death could be considered inadequate, particularly given there was no information or contact from the mother to inform them she was leaving the family home shortly after the child was died.

Mohammed Imran, a judge on the Metropolitan borough of Islington, told the commission: "At times, with the benefit of hindsight, the response of social services could seem clumsy or incompetent because of their inexperience or lack of training."

He said the failure of child protection services to intervene when the toddler went missing for three days prompted the child to have to be returned to his mother, but he added it was an action he wished they had taken too.

A spokesperson for the Department for Education said the latest assessment of the impact of child protection services for UK families was of "very mixed"
