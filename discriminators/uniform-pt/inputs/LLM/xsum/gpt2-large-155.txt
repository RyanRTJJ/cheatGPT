 remain on a starch, low-fat, high-fibre diet for one week. Neither group lost weight or gained any weight.

All volunteers lost weight but lost body fat and muscle mass at the same amounts if they swapped diets. Those on a starch diet lost weight more gradually, though after the switch they lost more weight than their counterparts who remained fat and inactive.

Lead author of the study Professor Susanne Heydegard said: "This study shows a dramatic and potentially important role of plant foods in our diet for weight loss as well as an improved waistline.

"It's exciting to see that replacing carbohydrates with plant protein can make a huge difference to weight loss, though other factors like exercise and other lifestyle changes need to be considered when deciding whether a diet or lifestyle change is most appropriate for one person," Professor Heydegard added.

"We really want to identify how and why low-carb eating may better support weight loss so more effective low-carb diets could be developed and distributed on a global scale.

"The results really are exciting. For the first time, we have shown for sure that low-fat dieting actually work by promoting weight loss, which is the most realistic goal for an overweight population," Professor Sheydegard said.

The study is published in the journal Plos One.

The research

During two weeks researchers studied the effects of a vegetarian diet on the body composition of the two groups. The vegetarian group had their baseline body weight measured while following a low-fibre diet and then switched their diet to a vegetarian one for a week. The other group stayed on low-fat, high-fibre diet that remained unchanged for two weeks.

The study was carried out on volunteers from the University of Cambridge School of Medicine, the American Cancer Society Cancer Research Institute in Atlanta and a rural Kenyan village.

Volunteers had a BMI ranging from 18.42 to
