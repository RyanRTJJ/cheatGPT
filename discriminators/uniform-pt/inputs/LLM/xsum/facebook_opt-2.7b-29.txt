A spokesperson for Nissan told the BBC: “There is no news to report.”

Mr Nissan’s other plant in Sunderland, North East England, will shut down on 31 March. The plant has over the past 18 months become the face of Mr Clark’s pledge to create tens of thousands of jobs at the automotive end of the UK car industry. Sunderland accounts for about 20,000 of the UK’s 40,000 car makers and car-parts manufacturers.

The company’s CEO at the time, Carlos Ghosn, also rebuffed the suggestion that Nissan was in talks with the French government.

It has also taken a knock from European Union plans to harmonise car safety regulations, which could make Sunderland’s vehicles less desirable. Nissan now wants to create a “skills hub” on the nearby site of its former engine plant, which could house up to 2,000 engineers who work on the latest Nissan models at the company’s biggest factory in northern Europe.
