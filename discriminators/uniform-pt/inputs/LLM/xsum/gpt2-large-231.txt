Wukong Bikes and its Chinese supplier, Jia Zhongliang, jointly operate the chain that specializes in custom steel bikes, as well as bicycles for local cities, such as Shenzhen. For safety, the bikes are painted black and are sold only by Wukong's local partners.

If this doesn't sound familiar, it's because the founder of Jia is a well-known "cycling gangster" in China, but in the 1990s most of this business was carried out in secret.

One local retailer who deals with Chinese bikers said he'd learned from an informant that the Wukong bikes are manufactured to the exact same spec as the ubiquitous Japanese bikes sold to Japanese riders. One of the owners of Wukong Bikes, who preferred not to be named, said he also sold steel bikes for Chinese gangs operating in rural China.

The Wukong bikes, made by Guangdong-based Jia, reportedly have two-wheelers to cover a range of distances between 20 and 200 miles. Their frame, similar to the European-produced Kammel K2 frame, is a composite of aluminum and carbon fiber. It is made in China but assembled in the United States.

The bikes are assembled in one of two stages. First, they are welded together on a "wedge" frame which is welded with aluminum. The second stage, in which the steel is machined, also takes place in China.

It was not until late last month that Jia said that, like other bicycle makers, including Daido, it was cutting ties with Wukong Bikes.

Calls to Mr. Wuchao, whose telephone number listed on the Internet, were not answered.

Shenzhen-based Wuchao Bikes said its products could be easily purchased through third-party retailers. On Monday, it showed pictures of a stock of 250 two-wheelers, including the three bikes sold to USA Today.

On its Web site, the company said that its "brand identity" remains unchanged and "will never change." Its website also said it will be conducting an investigation to
