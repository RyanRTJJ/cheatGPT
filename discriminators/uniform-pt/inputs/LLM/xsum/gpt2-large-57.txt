"I think they must start looking for a different way to keep them in their place for the people who can handle them," Stewart said, adding that the city often does not have "sufficient" spaces for the huge gatherings on the lawns of restaurants and bars. City council is also working on its own plan for Bonfire Night, which involves having larger, temporary areas in designated areas on the lawns of the city's four civic buildings, said Councillor Doug Ford. Some people at the council meeting voiced support for Bonfire Night on the grounds that it helps people get out into the neighbourhood around them before and at festivals.

No one from the city has been invited to present on the final plan. When asked why people are fighting, Ford said that, if nothing else, the city's plan might be changed — and that's the council's job — to change the plans.
