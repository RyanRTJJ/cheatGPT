 address since the fine had been issued in 2015

Mr Platt, who is the son of Labour MP John Lewis and previously worked with him in Parliament, claimed he had not received his email after his latest address was published for the second time in the past week.

Yesterday, a senior spokesman for Mr Lewis said: 'We are pleased that we can get this process running smoothly and the council has accepted John's appeal and apologised for their error.'

The council did not apologise after making Mr Platt's original address public.

When asked today whether he would be taking the matter up with the Labour leader, Mr Platt said: 'It's still on the agenda. I would hope Jeremy Corbyn will take it up when he's in Wellington and he comes to see me and make some progress.'

Last week, Mr Platt criticised the cost and expense of his daughter's summer holiday to Florida. He said she was given a summer place for just £3,000 after she complained about her travel.

In the first week of July this year he claimed the second annual council fine of £400 because she had not been able to prove her address had been changed

Mr Platt said yesterday he and his daughter were already planning to go on another trip to Florida in 2017. He said: 'She is already planning a trip to Florida next year. She has a school age daughter so she knows exactly how easy it is to get there when you're the age of a nine year old. So I'm hoping that she'll make a return visit.

'I just think we are getting a bit complacent with our costs because they go up so much when people do this sort of thing.'

Earlier this year Mr Lewis told the Sunday Times: 'There are some instances when I would not recommend that parents take their children on holiday, even just for a week or two, while a fine is on the line, but John seems to be doing an uncharacteristic amount of travel this winter.'
