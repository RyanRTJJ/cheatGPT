 in south-east London by a friend he had been staying with earlier in the morning.

Police said Mr Hardman's mother was informed by a friend as she was getting ready to go to a family meeting that he had died.

The musician's body was handed on to a mortician, who confirmed he had died of hanging.

Det Insp Nick Hulme, from the homicide and major crime command, said Mr Hardman had a history of depression and was previously receiving counselling.

The detective said: "This is a unique, individual tragedy and one that has affected a large number of people, including the musician's family and friends as well as the public.

"Having spoken to people today, they felt extremely saddened and shocked."

A post-mortem revealed his death was the result of hanging.

Ch Insp Dean Haydon, of the Homicide and Major Crime Command, described the musician as a "loveable, popular and friendly young man" who had a young family.

He added: "This is a tragic incident and we must not speculate as there is ongoing work by the Forensic Collision Investigation Team. This is now a sudden, unexplained and tragic death and our thoughts are with the family of the musician."

A spokesman from the band, All Time Low, said: "Over the past two years, Chris suffered from the loss of someone very close to him and felt as if he were alone in the world.

"He felt incredibly sad but grateful to have found new friends at each stage, but nothing could possibly prepare him for the loss of what seemed like his best friend."

The spokesman said it was not yet known whether the musician would be performing live.

He said: "We would ask that the fans he would have wanted to see and hear tonight are patient and kind to one another as we go through this difficult time."
