 Last week the shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, said politicians had "got the money wrong" and blamed a "perverse mindset" for NHS funding decisions. The Institute for Health Innovation predicts that NHS spending may fall by as much 0.5% above inflation in 2015 but has forecast that the trend will reverse over the next few years, rising by at least 0.4% by 2022.

The Institute of Fiscal Studies is more cautious, seeing health spending rising by less than half this amount in the next two years. A report last month produced similar conclusions about the future of health and social care, adding that even though there had been some improvement in the ratio of public spending on NHS, schools and social care, this had been more than neutralised to account for the rise in population and rising living standards.

This has been at a time when the government's plans to reduce NHS budget deficits and boost hospital productivity have not been happening fast enough to keep pace with rising demand and rising costs. Indeed David Cameron used to claim that government spending growth was "unsustainable". The government's strategy to improve the efficiency of the NHS, in particular, is supposed to focus on the £700m-a-day "avoidable" errors that are leading to unnecessary hospital deaths, with a particular emphasis on doctors' handovers between A&E, wards and the operating theatre. Last month the Health and Social Care Committee warned (pdf) that while £700m is being spent on improving doctor handovers, £2 billion had already been spent on a new NHS IT system that "falls woefully short of providing a robust solution for the day-to-day workflow".

The argument, therefore, as I see it, comes down to this: the financial pressures of the Tory-led coalition were such that we needed greater efficiency and productivity in the NHS, which we were delivering through the Efficiency and Productivity Unit, the NHS Innovation Board and, most recently, the NHS Trust Development Authority.
