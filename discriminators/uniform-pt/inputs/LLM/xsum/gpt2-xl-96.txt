Mr McDonnell added that he would meet the mayor or deputy mayor if they had any queries regarding the planning process.

Mr McMahon has rejected the claims and said he was "open to any discussions with the council regarding the planning process and the needs of this area".

"I am a firm supporter of the regeneration of North Belfast and the future of this part of the city," he said.

"I am open to any discussions with the council regarding the planning process and the needs of this area."

Mr McGlone said it was his personal view that North Belfast's needs "were best met within the North Belfast development envelope".

"We are not in any way prepared to be seen opposing the regeneration of the current Northern Ireland context," he added. "I look forward to engaging with the mayor and with the community and will endeavour to answer any questions that he may have."

South Belfast councillor Emma Little said the developments were "incompatible" with the community feel that was being created in North Belfast and suggested that members of the community should be involved in the process.

She also suggested they be subject to "any necessary controls".

"Given the recent experience with the regeneration of the city's eastside, which has been largely dominated by huge office blocks, I fear that one or more major developments of comparable scale could well become an obstacle for the regeneration of this part of the city," she said.

"Any decision around the location of these buildings will require the consultation
