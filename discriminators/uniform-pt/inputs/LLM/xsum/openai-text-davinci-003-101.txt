 with a hammer, dragged her into a river and tried to bind her wrists before an onlooker intervened.

Hollerin, of Accrington, Lancashire, had denied attempted murder but was convicted of an offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

The court heard Hollerin and the woman had communicated through a Facebook page and met up the day before the attack in the river in Accrington.

Hollerin said the woman had told him that "she had seen the other side" and that she was going to go there, adding: "She seemed to be urging her own death."

The court heard that Hollerin attacked the woman despite her protestations, repeatedly striking her to her head and body with a hammer, then dragging her into the river, where he attempted to tie her wrists together.

He was eventually stopped by passers-by. The woman suffered multiple head and neck injuries in the attack.

Sentencing Hollerin, Judge Robert Altham said: "Although it appears that this offence was committed spontaneously, it is undoubtedly a sustained and vicious attack.

"You meant to put an end to the life of the woman so that her spirit may be released, although I am satisfied you had no ordinary murderous intent."

Hollerin was jailed for seven years.
