 abortion after ordering her to submit a court deposition. In the deposition, she told of being raped and beaten by men and raped twice after she told them she was underage, after which the men told her to have sex with her boyfriends. By then, she says she was 13. She received medication as a means to kill the foetus. She went into hiding from family members and neighbours as soon as the rape and torture stopped, until she fled abroad to escape her pursuers. Her doctors told her not to have an abortion due to a lack of facilities. “I told them what I experienced as a victim of rape and they said I should not have them and I will go abroad I am scared of those people.” The woman sued for compensation and lost out. She went abroad, changed her name and was granted asylum. When the police finally traced her whereabouts, she decided to flee again and she was then attacked by her ex-boyfriend, who forced her to have an abortion. She was later charged with having non-existent and fake medical documents and was sentenced to four-and-a-half months in jail. The victim was then granted an abortion by having the abortion in a private clinic. The judge accepted her case as a result of her not wanting an abortion, but she was charged with having fake papers and a non-existent birth certificate, after she fled abroad.

The court accepted her story as a genuine one, stating that she was under no pressure. However, after it accepted her story, it ruled that the abortion was against the law and sentenced the woman to three and a half months in jail. While the case will be reviewed by the higher courts, she is certain that her story is genuine. She has been granted asylum in the United Kingdom.

The following video was recorded before the judge accepted the case. It shows the woman speaking on July 22, 2015, in English, the Court accepting her case and rejecting her claims, granting her request for an abortion, sentencing to three and a half months in prison, and granting asylum to the woman.
