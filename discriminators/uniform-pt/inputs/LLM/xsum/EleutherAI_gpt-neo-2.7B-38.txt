 attended the meeting, where they heard about the company's future since taking over from National Grid.

The company says it will continue to operate under a 10-year concession deal signed in December 2017, allowing it to maintain the quality of service it has provided to almost all its customers since the takeover.

But Wrexham council, which owns the former National Grid sites, has argued that allowing the company to continue operating would cost at least an extra £2.7m in operational costs alone.

The council has said it is confident that the deal will proceed, with a planning meeting slated for Tuesday morning to approve a number of conditions that will form part of the agreement for Severn Trent to have the same rights and obligations as the former owner as far as maintenance of infrastructure and infrastructure works is concerned.

The council will then ask council leaders to approve a plan for an area to be known as the “Wrexham Severn Trent corridor”, and to consider issuing planning consent for the scheme.

It is understood that Severn Trent Water was represented at the meeting, with representatives from the Wrexham and Severn Trent councils, and former National Grid bosses and chief executive Anthony Bouchard also in attendance.

It is not known exactly when plans for the site and a road will be announced, with details being submitted to Severn Trent Water as part of the agreement to form the company.

My partner and I have been looking into building a bespoke garden for our son's future home. We are keen to get our initial investment down, but have a limited budget.

Thanks for any help you can give.
