 been cautioned, also scored to make the aggregate lead five in that first half.

Micheal O'Neill's side won the second leg 2-0 to ensure that they go through, in Belfast and Derry respectively.

Ballymena United and Crusaders had already been eliminated with the first legs ending 1-1.

In the Irish League, Crusaders lost 4-3 on aggregate after falling 3-1 at Coleraine. Ballymena also lost their Europa League quest to Linfield.

"This is a great thing for Irish football," O'Neill said.

"We haven't got the results in the Premiership from the quality that we're playing against - Crusaders are a top, top class side - but you saw in the second half that we took them on."
