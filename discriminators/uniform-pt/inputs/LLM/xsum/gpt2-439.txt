Frontex and a Greek official were told by police what they were doing in Turkey on Wednesday.

Migrants from the conflict-torn country were forced to turn over to the Greek government in Macedonia, where police had confiscated their passports and other documents.

Greek officials confirmed that police were on the scene of the rescue operation in two large cemeteries. A Greek ministry spokesman later told reporters that four men were on the ground and told Greek media the rescue operation was under way.

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said he hoped the situation in Turkey would end quickly. He warned Athens against further steps and called on the region to "restrict the flows" and a halt to the international "peace process."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Turkey and Greece were holding a press conference to reassure the international community, which was being held as part of an ongoing refugee crisis in Europe. "We have always said that we want to see the situation under control," Merkel told reporters before departing for Istanbul.
