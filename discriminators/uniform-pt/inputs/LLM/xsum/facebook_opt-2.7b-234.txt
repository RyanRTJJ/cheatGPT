Juan Mata believes his future is at Arsenal. But is still waiting to complete the deal that would make his time at Manchester United official.

The Spanish midfielder has agreed a contract with the Premier League leaders but the move has been held up by Barcelona. The deal is worth around £37m, with Mata having accepted a 60% wage reduction. Barcelona were reportedly unwilling to pay Mata the standard £80,000-75,000 weekly rate that many of their former players receive at the Nou Camp.

"I love Barcelona, I've been away for four years now. I have very good memories but this is what's happening at the moment," Mata said. He added: "I think I'm in a stage that's very important for me. I'm not a boy who says one thing and then does another and people expect one thing. I am who I am. I hope and wish this will happen before Manchester United.

"It's not clear, it depends on the other club, what they want [for their players]. I will work until the end of the transfer window. At the moment I'm doing all I can to help the team and I hope the deal will be the best.

"Once something goes through, we will think about things that can help the team and that's the most important thing."

Barcelona president Sandro Rosell was speaking in Beijing on Tuesday. He said that, after a series of negotiations, Mata is one of the 12 players on the verge of leaving Barcelona in a player exchange deal for Arsenal. He said some players had taken 20% wage cuts.

Rosell also denied reports that the player in a deal to swap the two clubs was Alexis Sánchez.
