 be forced into the 12 or 18-hour day. The study authors also pointed to evidence from other countries where 12-hour working days were dropped in the 1970s and 1980s without a significant increase in breast cancer rates. However, other experts have challenged much of the report's evidence as being in conflict with results from other studies.

Shift-work research

The review comes after several studies suggested that people working more hours have a higher risk of breast cancer. This has led some to question the possible medical significance of shift-work being good for health.

But a review published in BMJ in March found no clear links between shift-work and breast cancer risk and called for more scientific research on the subject.

What is shift-work?

Shifting working hours are often described as "shift-work". Shift work is where workers are asked to switch between night and day shifts.

Common shift work examples include being on a night-shift or "flying" between different sites during the day. Some workers may be forced to do shifts between 6am and 11pm - a pattern which has been linked to increased rates of obesity and type-2 diabetes in people.

A common complaint from shift workers is that people often do not take them seriously when they talk about health. Workers in retail and supermarket call centres have also said they feel like they are being looked down on and are dismissed as lazy by others around them.

What were the conclusions of the review?

The review's authors analysed more than 200 studies on the potential impact of shift work on health. This included studies published between 2000 and 2011.

The review found that studies showed no clear link between shift work and increased breast cancer risk among women, or reduced risk of type-2 diabetes among men. However, the analysis found increased risk of respiratory infections when it came to shift work among men.

The authors of the BMJ study suggested that shift-work has been a public health challenge without a clear risk-benefit relationship.

Shifting work is likely to be bad for the health of the most vulnerable members of society
