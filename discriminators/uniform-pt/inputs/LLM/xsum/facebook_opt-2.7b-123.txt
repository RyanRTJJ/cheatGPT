He said: “You just need to look at the number of people employed in this business, its annual turnover, the number of businesses around the UK involved, or the number of people who will directly benefit from this, for this is hugely important for the long-term future of this country.

“This industry and this workforce, it is truly vital for the economy of this country. It gives access to jobs and it gives access to opportunities.”

The development work started two summers ago when the company began developing its latest, space-proven technology.

Philip McBride said: “We've invested in people and technology that enables us to move these to the next stage and get the first samples off into space.”

The new facility has a £20m design and will be able to house two centrifuges, which handle the separation of plasma into charged particles and uncharged particles, the company says.

In the future, the company could also be producing rocket propellant for re-use from the payload section of its rockets.

“So the concept of space flight for us is no longer just about lifting people up into space but actually being able to take them to space for the benefit not just of the country but the world," explained Dr John Kelly of Astrium.

“That will be a very important focus when we move out to Mars or indeed the Moon and it is therefore only possible to do this through manufacturing here in the UK.”

The investment comes a little over a year since Virgin Group announced a new £150m facility south east of Carlisle which would allow the construction of a hydrogen powered shuttle.

“Virgin has a very exciting programme of its own at the moment in their new facility," said Mr McBride.

“That will be something for them in the future.

“But Virgin are also investing in the development of this technology and that will allow us to move out to the edge of space.”

The new centre will include facilities and laboratories for the processing, separation and storage of samples from space.

Once a sample has been collected by the International Space Station or a future moon probe, it can
