 told the broadcaster: "The Scottish government is determined to get back to balance as soon as possible, taking account of Scotland's unique economic circumstances.

"That will mean increasing our investment in infrastructure as well as increasing the amount of money we spend on public services which benefit the wider Scottish economy. It also means reducing spending as a percentage of Scottish GDP, putting pressure on household budgets, and building a strong public support.

"Scotland is different because of our economic size and the scale of the challenges we face, but in spite of all the challenges we face we remain determined to deal with them as a nation.

"We look forward to working with all parts of the UK government as we set out our plans in the months and years ahead."

The deficit showed a significant improvement over the previous year, but Ms Sturgeon said it needed "to be balanced with a reduction in spending".

Ms Sturgeon said the improvement was only at the start of what needed to be done on the economy.

She added: "Scotland's economy continues to grow rapidly and we need to see even more progress. We will be spending this year in deficit, but only as a result of the impact that the collapse in oil prices had on our finances.

"The Scottish budget continues to be set by the Barnett Formula, with significant areas still to be covered by public money but significantly increased spending by the UK as a result of low oil prices."

Ms Sturgeon added: "The government will not allow any of this to damage the national public finances by diverting resources away from other parts of the UK and, in fact, the Scottish budget is set in a way that reduces the impact for Scotland of the UK's ongoing structural change and its dependence on a volatile oil price."

Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: "The government is facing a severe cash challenge but the fact is that Scotland is different. The size of our economy and the scale of the challenges we have are very different to those faced by the rest
