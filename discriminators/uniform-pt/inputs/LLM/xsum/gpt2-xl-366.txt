 be back behind bars for assault and dangerous driving.

He denied all the charges, including two counts of sexual assault, three counts of exposure, two counts of causing fear and being drunk.

A trial for the four-day case due to begin in court today had been called off because of a delay in the witness statements being taken from the alleged victims.

A full transcript from one of them has been released in court, with her sworn statement describing her ordeal.

She told of her ordeal in the dock at London's Southwark Crown Court and her distress after hearing Ward speak "untruthfully'' to the magistrate.

She said he said to her: "My wife was a little bit sick. I'm just here being nice.''

The woman told Wills jurors she did not trust Ward as her ex-husband had used her as a "hit girl'' in the past.

She said he attacked her with a knife, grabbed her and threatened to kill her if she told anyone.

The woman alleged: "He made me sit on his chest while he was on top of me. I kept begging him not to [use a knife] but he forced me to submit.''

Asked what happened Ward admitted to the woman he "had sex with a woman'' but denied raping her.

He said: ''I had sex with a woman.''

But the woman said: ''He wasn't in my bed. I could see him in the doorway. He came in the room and forced me to submit.

''He held me on top of him. He had a knife. He grabbed my face and I was trying to push him off me but he held me and I was afraid of him.''

Asked if she was in a consensual sexual encounter, the woman said: ''I had no choice if I wanted to leave. If you look at it like that it wasn't a consensual thing.''

She claimed she was left'shaken and shocked' by the incident, adding: ''I'm worried this happens to other women.''
