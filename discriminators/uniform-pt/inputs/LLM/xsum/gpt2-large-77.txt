 from the Union of Students in Education said: "As union officers, we have known for some time that NASUWT was going to have more than its say in the union's leadership election, which is what went down on Tuesday 6 December. In the past five years NASUWT has been part of a leadership election held every two years, but that has always been in the context of membership elections.

"The only way this leadership election could be held this year is as a result of the 'fury of betrayal' among the rank-and-file that some people in management say they witnessed. At a time when we are under such an enormous attack from our bosses, as well as from the bosses in the government, we have no reason to give in.

"Our members who have been at our schools over a decade have put up great resistance against working conditions, the administration are in office, our demands are being ignored and students lack our support. More than this, the union of teachers is losing the trust of students.

"The decision not to endorse the leadership election came in a crisis," added Mr Weir. He continued: "Despite this, we are not going to be leaving our schools. We want to ensure our members remain engaged with the issues surrounding the strike, which are at the absolute heart of our fight against this privatisation and austerity."

NASUWT is the largest teachers' union in Northern Ireland. It has 2,086 branches, and last year it endorsed a new leadership race, with Sinn Fein taking three of the 12 seats held.

A strike ballot was held last Friday night, during which NASUWT supported the proposal of two members of union management to stand in the election, which was held in December 2016.

Union leaders had to resort to strike ballots this year because of a high turnover of members since the election.

A statement published on union website last week claimed that the vote had been rigged to give union management a majority,
