 2008 economic downturn actually were hurt by the bailout of the financial system, they might try to sue again.

A Federal Appeals Court said Wednesday that it is up to a lower court to determine how to handle claims by businesses that say they have been hurt because banks received the $700-billion federal bailout of the financial industry.

Businesses whose bank accounts were wiped out by the lending spigot have taken losses. But a group of individuals who had invested in stock through companies that received bailout money and were later bought by others said it was unfair for them to be included in the claims pool.

The high court asked for a new look from a judge in a lower court.

The case involves 1,200 individuals, or investors, who filed a lawsuit alleging that banks received money through the Troubled Assets Relief Program to support the financial bailout that saved the U.S. from collapsing in 2008. They lost money when the stock market dipped.

The program created the TARP, an acronym for the $700-billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. Congress set up the money to rescue banks, and later approved a second $350 billion fund to bail out companies in areas such as A.I.G., the government-owned insurance firm once led by Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg.

The complaint says that individuals invested money through a company called C.V. Starr and that C.V. Starr used a money manager for investment counseling. They filed a lawsuit against bank regulators and two New York-based banks that they said were the recipients of TARP funds. Some of the recipients were acquired by other companies, including C.V. Starr.

Many businesses in the area lost money when the financial system collapsed in 2008 and the government decided to bale out banks that were on the brink of failure. A group called the Business Roundtable estimates firms in upstate New York alone lost $50 billion as a result of the bailout.

A lower court threw out the lawsuit, saying the government cannot be sued for damages. That means that banks did take in money from the bailed-out funds for themselves,
