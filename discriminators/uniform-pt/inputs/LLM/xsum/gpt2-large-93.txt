 stations "to ensure a smooth, safe and fast journey, avoiding accidents".

The Department for Transport has said it is reviewing Lincoln's timetable following Rail Fair's criticism that the delays had caused "very costly disruption to London businesses and passengers".

The Department of Transport confirmed it had "received complaints" of "unacceptable delays at some of the busiest stations in London" and was "working with those stations to resolve them as quickly as possible".

It announced in June that it was bringing forward a timetable for the north west, including the Bakerloo line, from January.

But Rail Fair's chairman Paul Brown said: "We are concerned that commuters should not be enduring such slow journeys due to lack of resources. More needed to be done on this front, because the timetable change for the north west does not address the root cause of the problem, which is a lack of investment in our public transport."

He said the UK government should fund upgrades in all stations and that "the railways are failing" on improving capacity. "Too many stations are running at 70-80% capacity, too many routes are too crowded to cater for the demand, and stations are running on reduced levels of service."

The rail firm Siemens said it had announced 1,800 staff would be laid off and 400 more would be added while the company took a further 860 new train operators to service. Siemens is also bringing in extra rolling stock, bringing the total to 5,000, bringing the total to 870.

But an industry source said: "We need to invest again to bring the capacity back up so that we can accommodate all the new trains."

A Department for Transport spokesman said: "Ministers are already investing further in rail infrastructure across the country. Our investment will help improve services across the country, deliver jobs and boost growth, and improve the safety of passengers."

He added that it would be up to public bodies and companies to decide how to spend the extra funds.
