 the sponsors of the torch event and has lent them a 3-series as a car to transport the torch around Britain, in partnership with British flag carrier, flight operator and owner-operator of UK airports, British Airways.

Cameron began the torch event with a visit to the London 2012 Athletes’ Village at the Olympic Stadium on Tuesday (26 July) in what was described as an act of “civic pomp” ahead of the torch carrying ceremony to be held on Friday (29 July).
The British Prime Minister is joined on his visit by UK Olympic Committee (UKOC) Chairman Lord Coe, and he will meet the athletes and coaches from the Olympic Team.
He also took time to meet some of the athletes currently training at the Olympic training camp to learn more about some of the issues they are facing ahead of the Games.

Lord Coe said, "I am delighted to welcome David Cameron and the flame to the Olympic Stadium and I am confident we will deliver the Games that will showcase Britain. This is a great moment for London. We are about to welcome the most inspirational athletes and the most incredible people to a city that is going places."

The Olympic torch will be carried across London by torchbearers representing all 48 UK nations. They will take the torch through 40 towns in a week-long journey around the country, before it gets carried by the Queen at the opening ceremony at the Olympic Stadium on 27 July.

The torch is expected to take six and a half days to run through London with torchbearers expected to reach an average speed of 50 mph to take in the sights and sounds of London, with over 30 miles of the journey taking place in the West End, the most famous part of London.
