ures the Lions spot in Round 10 of the World Cup Qualifiers.

The Tigers looked on the brink at the break, but the boot of Blake - one of five Englishmen in the side with Riddell - ensured they stayed in the game, a run of errors from the Scottish pack allowing him to steal possession and run 60 yards, with the ball squirting into the corner.

After a period of pressure in the game at Murrayfield, it ended with a last-gasp try which left England's World Cup hopes hanging by a thread. But the momentum of the game had swung with the score tied at 8-8, and Riddell was to prove decisive. A poor pass from replacement Liam Williams at the scrum was latched on to by the Welshman, who beat a host of defenders for a 60-yard touchdown and put the home side in front.

England, who face Wales in a repeat of the Six Nations grand final at Twickenham on 27 March, were without the services of Ben Youngs and Marland Yarde, with Ben Morgan also ruled out following injury earlier.

Leicester Tigers coach Mark Humphrey speaking to BT Sport:

"Obviously we're disappointed. I was confident going in and we were always comfortable - but we lost the penalty that led to Chris Farrell's try and put things away.

"It wasn't a surprise to lose it, that was our third time [being out-of-sport] at the World Cup. You need to learn from that and our next step will be looking to win the next game."

Scotland captain and skipper Kelly Brown turning to Sky's Jonathan Agnew:

Rangers have a history of coming here in the World Cup and they come up against a very strong side here. We can play like we did last year and be confident, it just doesn’t happen that often. It’s good to be part of a World Cup squad.

"It’s going to be a tough competition for us and I believe we’ve shown we can compete and we’ll go and hopefully win.
