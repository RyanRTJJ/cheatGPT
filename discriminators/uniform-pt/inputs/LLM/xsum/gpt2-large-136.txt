 and down from 5.2% in July of 2014.

For January-March, January-March employment grew by a revised 0.8%, whereas the corresponding period last year was down 0.2% year-on-year and down by 0.4% for February-March.

Meanwhile, the labour force participation rate fell for the first time in 12 months, and fell significantly, by 0.1 percentage points for June-July. It was in a lower range from that level in June-July 2014. The decrease from April to June of last year was the sole reason for the decline in the labour market performance.

On the other hand, the participation rate registered a significant increase in February, as indicated by the chart below. The participation rate hit a high of 72.3% in November 2004, an unprecedented high level for that time period and it continued to rise steadily.

In addition, the participation rate remained virtually unchanged in August 2016.

In the third quarter of last year, the participation rate dropped to 64.6%, down from 65.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Of course, the drop in participation rates is only possible if the overall labour market has returned to full employment as suggested by the previous post, "Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) in the UK â€“ July-June 2016."

Regarding the fourth and fifth quarters that are now in 2013, in April 2013 the labour force (employees) participation rate reached 64.9%, in June 2013 it hit 69.4% and in July 2013 it reached 69.9%. Also in July 2013, the participation rate reached 75.0%. However, the rate fell by 8.0% for June-July 2014, although, it was below the July 2013 participation rate of 76.1% in December 2012.

As indicated on the chart below, the participation rate in December 2012 was at 69.2%, which means that there is a gap of 18.1% that is now being filled. It fell in August 2012 to 67.3% and in August 2014 it was at 70.5% as compared to July 2014.

The participation rate fell to 65.6% in November 2012 and at 66.7% in December 2012
