e increase was due to “increased awareness of the disease, wider testing and more accurate accurate reporting of cases”.

The main cause of the rise in cases was a “sizable increase” in the number of people aged between 15-24 years old who were diagnosed with flu, PHE said.

The number of under-15s who caught the flu also rose from 560 cases to 1,139.

“Influenza activity in England during the 2017/18 season was higher than in 2016/17, but was within expected levels for this time of year,” Dr Richard Pebody, head of respiratory diseases at PHE, said.

“The rise in the under-15s group may represent a reinforcement of the importance of offering the free flu vaccine to this age group.”

He added: “I would urge anyone eligible for the flu vaccination but who hasn’t yet had it this season to contact their GP or pharmacy as soon as possible and get the vaccine. Once immunity starts to wane after vaccination, it is too late to be protected this winter.”
