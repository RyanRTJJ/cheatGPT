vernment. The unregulated tests are set by the schools themselves, and often include academic questions designed to check pupils' knowledge and skills. The tests are usually overseen by an independent invigilator, but the lack of consistent standards and externally set criteria mean that results can vary widely from school to school. This can lead to some pupils who should be admitted to a grammar school being passed over, while others who are not as well prepared are accepted.

The unregulated exam system has been called into question in recent years due to concerns about its fairness and the inequity in standards between different schools. Critics argue that the lack of regulation and monitoring allows some schools to gain an unfair advantage and puts pupils from less affluent backgrounds at a disadvantage.

Proponents argue that the unregulated exams provide a way to select pupils on their merits and help to ensure that children are able to demonstrate their academic abilities. They believe that it allows schools to preserve their autonomy and control their admissions process in order to provide an environment tailored to the needs of their students.

The unregulated exams remain a controversial issue, with opinions often divided along socioeconomic lines. Ultimately, it is up to the government and school administrators to decide if unregulated exams are a fair and equitable way of selecting pupils for grammar school entry.
