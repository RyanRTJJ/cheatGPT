They had won their last two Tests at Trent and Cardiff by more than 200 runs and were set to celebrate a third successive victory after holding on for victory in Hobart. However, only nine years later, the England team arrived at The Oval carrying with it a deep and abiding shame, one that had no other context but that of a defeat at their own game, and that in turn was an indictment not only on them but also on the very concept of Test cricket.

That was clear from the day of the first Test in the subcontinent's major city. The only time the sides played was during the two-match tour of Sri Lanka at the end of 2014, and in the match at the ground there were no wickets to bowl out.
