Kazuhisa Asai, a shareholder of the largest of the largest Japanese hedge funds, told Reuters a bid at least $1.5 billion was possible, but he stopped short of identifying the specific buyers.

Toshiba already announced it would halt production at two of its plants, one in Japan and another in South Korea, by the end of the year.
