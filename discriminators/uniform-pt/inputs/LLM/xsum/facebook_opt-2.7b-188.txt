 Sturgeon then called for a referendum on independence in September 2014, but the UK government refused to hold one.

Scotland's deficit, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility, now totals 8.1% of GDP. The country has no formal deficit-fighting mechanism, but can access loans worth up to Â£5bn from the Bank of England to tackle its funding concerns. Scotland's borrowing costs are also higher than the rest of the UK and the rest of the Eurozone.

The last time Ms Sturgeon had the chance to hold another referendum, in 2016, 56% of Scots backed independence. But Ms Sturgeon wants the power to hold another referendum in 2019.

What does the UK think of Sturgeon's demand?

The UK government said the Scottish government had a responsibility to get its own house in order.

Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: "The SNP want a second independence referendum. We think they should go through the process of getting their house in order first.

"If the Scottish government wants to give people the option to determine Scotland's future, then that has to happen in a legal and democratic way.

BBC political correspondent Laura Kuenssberg said UK ministers were "not impressed" by Ms Sturgeon's demand.

Labour MP Alison Thewliss also called on the UK government to agree to Ms Sturgeon's demand.

The leader of the SNP's Westminster group Ian Blackford said Ms Sturgeon had "staked her political future" on holding another independence vote, adding: "I am now at this point of no return."

But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called another independence vote a "reckless move".

"It would be totally unworkable," he said.

What happens next?

Ms Sturgeon has indicated she will challenge Scotland's current constitutional arrangements in the Scottish parliament in an attempt to force a new vote on separation. The Scottish government says it is in breach of the UK constitution.
