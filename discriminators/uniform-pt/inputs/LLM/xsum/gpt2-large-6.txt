 Battersea, to Croydon, in southern London.

The problem affected some services from 6am to 11pm on Tuesday and was eventually resolved by Saturday morning.

At 11am the Bank branch reopened after an airbnb booking process saw "100% cancellation rates" on a weekday, she said.

However, she said there were no extra services like the morning rush hour and on Saturday there were no new services opening between Mill Hill and Croydon because "no one is available - it's the busiest weekend of the year".

In a tweet, she added: "The worst time for #bankbranch to be used is early morning. The problem started around 5.30am and by 10am it was over."

RMT transport union organiser Mick Cash agreed with Kaye that the service had been "severely disrupted".

"If we see any disruption on weekdays then we are expecting people to be frustrated. We need a bit more clarity on what was on the train.

"It's an unfortunate outcome but an unfortunate one," he said.

He added: "The idea of the company needing to open a branch in a high traffic area to service customers is completely unacceptable."

A spokesman for the company said: "We're very sorry about the disruption the business is experiencing.

"We are working together with RMT to provide services to customers as quickly as possible while we carry out due diligence about what's going on and resolve these issues as quickly as possible."

The Bank branch, in north Kensington, now provides free ATM withdrawals in the form of a debit card.

The firm, whose branches are all located in London, is also offering a free travel voucher as part of an "I'm Feeling Lucky" scheme.

A RMT spokesman said: "These commuters should be grateful that a branch opened in a highly-trafficked area but it appears that these businesses aren't prepared to treat their customers well.

"It is deeply disappointing that RMT is supporting such dodgy business practices."
