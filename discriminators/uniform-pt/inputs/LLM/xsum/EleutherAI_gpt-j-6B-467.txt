atroopers at the height of the Troubles shot dead 13 young Irishmen, bystanders in the Catholic Bogside Flats of Derry.

The inquiry concluded that British forces had opened fire out of “fear or panic”. On the third anniversary of the massacre, 20 armed men, under cover of darkness, tried to drive the British army out of the Bogside but they were shot dead by the British army. In July, the families of those shot dead by the British were offered a £20m out-of-court payout. Some of the victims' relatives still plan to claim damages in the high court. A court action from victims and their families will go ahead later this year.

Sinn Féin was formed from the remnants of the Provisional IRA, which fought an armed campaign against British rule over the decades from 1969 onwards. It is now a political party working to implement the British-Irish (Good Friday) Agreement, which was signed in 1998 but has yet to be fully implemented; it is a signatory to power-sharing. The DUP opposes the agreement.

Mr McGuinness insisted there would not be any return to a hard, “unionist-first” agenda which dominated the Assembly for over a
