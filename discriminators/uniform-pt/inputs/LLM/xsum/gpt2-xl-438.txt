Scotland's budget deficit for 2014-15 was £2bn, but the public finances were also expected to shrink in 2015-16.

In his summer letter, Alex Salmond set out proposals to increase income tax income tax on the highest earners, raise an extra £8bn from ending stamp duty and increase the personal allowance for income tax, saying it was "very easy to propose, very difficult to actually deliver".

The first devolution powers were announced in September 2010, following years of wrangling between London and the SNP over powers over tax.

The prime minister also sought support from MPs from all parties which has caused concern that he remains opposed to further devolution, despite having a reduced majority in parliament.

Mr Cameron, who is also keen to secure support for the legislation, stressed that Labour had backed the legislation in
