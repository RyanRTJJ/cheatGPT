 suspended two people who were running a recruitment agency which had been contracted for up to 25 years. Det Ch Insp Matt O'Connor said: "The information was collected from police databases before being shared with the Council, who are working together to investigate what went wrong. "Whilst this is far from being the first case where this happened over the last few years and is not necessarily the norm, where this type of information about people has been disclosed this often, it is likely that any crimes have, at least in part, been committed. "The data being presented was already publicly available so if anyone were to see or use it, they would potentially be held accountable by police." Detective Constable David Cappall told the Sunday Times:"This sort of abuse is not acceptable. This is serious, and we are doing everything that we can to prevent this happening in the future." The council has launched an internal investigation into claims of systematic recruitment abuses by members of staff. The council said in late 2013 it was "taking swift action" after the Met suspended the firm for allegedly running 'inadequate' recruitment agencies for the council. 'Over and over again' The Met has been criticised for not disclosing evidence to local authorities of unlawful activity in these 'boutiques'. It has also lost funding after admitting to recruiting people on the NHS to work in their ward and its own offices.

My daughter is 14yrs old and will leave school this month at the age of 16.. I have lost her for no reason or reason whatever.

It is only in the last weeks or months that my friends have seen that she has had "boutique behaviour" such as, smoking, drinking etc.. She is a very nice, well educated 14 y/o girl and she has always been able to talk about her plans and to get help from me and my friends on a regular basis to overcome what is going on.
