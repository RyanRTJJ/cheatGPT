And when it comes to the subject of gender equality – which is no small matter for some of our founding fathers – there is a long-running debate about which is stronger in principle. While the European Court of Human Rights did not rule against male employees of multinational companies until 1997, a series of other judges agreed in 2004 that women were better off in workplaces than men – and that discrimination is unjustified.

The main issue is this: women now do more with less as well.

This, of course, does not eliminate the need for women to take a more active part of their jobs. But, while it's true that fewer women now get a full and equal pay raise as they aged than ever before (the number of women in the workforce fell by almost 20% between 1995 and 2001, for instance), there are some signs to suggest that that is happening despite the fact that women's work experience has never been greater.
