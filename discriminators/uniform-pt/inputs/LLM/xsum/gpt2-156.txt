 debt of â‚¬1.7 billion by 2019, the government said.

'No guarantee, no guarantee'

"Since the deadline is still in place, the authorities are already looking into this new project and we are trying to find a solution to the situation so that people can get paid up front for their investment in our business," said Prime Minister Joko Widodo in an interview with The Associated Press.

The building society, which had built the complex for about a decade, added: "We would like to thank Mr Widodo for his understanding, since he started this project and because of people's strong support. We welcome any proposal or proposal to help our business. We all understand the need for a new, open, transparent, modern and efficient business environment that will take us at maximum efficiency in all aspects of our global business.

It was unclear whether Mr Widodo had received any other financial assistance from other government departments, as he did not publicly respond to a question about it.

"This new phase is about our business growth, and we hope to get to this end by 2019," he said.

However, his office denied any plans to privatise the building societies.

"The number of people employed in our buildings is about 10 million and we do not employ an estimated 20,000 staff, although we do employ 10 million people [the construction company] has been doing this for almost 40 years, so we are happy to continue this business but it would be a mistake of our actions, not all the information [available] on this matter, will be relevant to some people," it said in a statement late on Thursday.

"This will be the responsibility of the business organization of the government and not any other government department, we are completely transparent by our law and take great pains to keep the information available and transparent."

In order to protect the building companies and businesses, a government source said that as soon as Mr Widodo returned to Jakarta, those within the government department who wished to speak to him could do so, in an effort not to offend him.

Mr Widodo will visit the country soon to visit
