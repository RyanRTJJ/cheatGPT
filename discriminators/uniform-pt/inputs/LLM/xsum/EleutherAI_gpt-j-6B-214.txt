 14% and home-cooked snacks and drinks by 10% to 709ml in June. But the firm warned that many retailers are “already starting to show signs of stress” with shoppers spending almost 40% more in the two weeks after Easter than after a normal bank holiday weekend.

It also said consumers were increasingly turning to smaller shops such as convenience stores that use a high proportion of frozen foods and drinks.

Sales of hand-held ice creams, such as chocolate, fruity, savoury, and ice cream-based drinks, recorded a 14.1% increase to 709ml, Nielsen said. Sales of home-cooked snacks and drinks – such as ready meals, frozen dishes and smoothies – rose by 10.5% to 669ml.

The firm noted that while consumers were increasing their take-away food and drink spending, overall takeaway and foodservice sales are expected to decline in the near term due to the strong pound and high inflation. “It is too early to say how the consumer will react, as we anticipate further rises in inflation and as these two factors start to weigh more heavily on shoppers in the coming months, the data will become less positive,” said Paul Clayton, chief executive of Nielsen Foods.

“This is a strong statement that is helping to stabilise consumers spending patterns,” said Tom Maguire, director and consumer practice lead at Nielsen. “It provides evidence that consumers are responding to higher inflation, which at the moment is low, by making their purchases more sensitive to price and more willing to forgo some convenience foods.”

However, he continued: “These data will still be an early indication of future trends, which are likely to weaken as inflation picks up and shoppers begin to feel additional price pressure from the strong pound.”

However, Maguire warned that the rising food prices were not evenly spread across the UK shops, with large retailers enjoying significantly more success than small businesses.
