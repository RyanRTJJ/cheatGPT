 time of the attack, he was on bail pending a prosecution for murder. In September 2016, the Appeal Court upheld the conviction of Mr Khalaf, convicting him of the two killings. In March 2017, he was sentenced to ten years for the robbery. The Crown appealed the sentence to the Supreme Court. On 22 April 2017, however, the Crown applied to the Supreme Court to vacate Mr Khalaf's conviction. On 12 May 2017, the Supreme Court overturned Mr Khalaf's conviction. Mr Khalaf was now entitled to consider his claim.

On 13 August 2016 on the fourth occasion, in an incident described in his brief, Mr Ali Khalaf attacked and robbed Mr Ndiku from behind during daylight hours walking between Speakers' Corner and a shopping centre, in a violent and highly dangerous manner. Mr Ndiku tried to defend himself despite being kicked and punched. Mr Ali Khalaf punched and kicked him in an uncontrollable rage. Mr Khalaf then beat Mr Ndiku with a metal pipe. Mr Ndiku sustained severe facial injuries, which left a dark mark on his cheekbone. He fell to the floor and suffered severe head injuries. He was also punched and kicked in the stomach, body cavity and face by the men. Mr Ndiku was later hospitalised and was in a critical condition. Over the next two days, Mr Halifat received several stitches to his face, and received treatment for bruising and swelling. On 11 September 2016, the Appeal Court upheld Mr Ali Khalaf's conviction of grievous bodily harm, and imposed a five-year sentence as part of the same sentence, which, among other considerations, set a minimum term of eight years' detention. On 14 August 2017, the Supreme Court quashed the conviction. Mr Ali Khalaf's conviction and sentence to life imprisonment have now been quashed. The matter has now been heard by the Full Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.
