 his family as heartbroken as anyone could be," said Mayor Of Manchester Bob Carr. "The man has continued to recover, and we feel that this loss is a message at a time when many young people are at the mercy of the law. Mr Samwell has been shot in the head. We are absolutely devastated." Police have been called to the Rialto Valley shopping centre where Mike and seven other passengers were taken after a suspected robbery at 9am.

"I have called Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service who have been on scene now to get this information to them, and we are doing the best we can to provide medical attention for any injured, who might need help. I heard about Mike on the news earlier this evening and I've been calling from my car to try and get him to come home," said neighbour Jim Staley. "He did have a couple of fractures around his eyes, it was all just a matter of time, after that it got better, there have been a number of people with eye injuries." Mike returned to his car late on Sunday night after visiting his mother at his home. He was taken to hospital for initial surgery, but died on Monday.

"There was a very strange sight. I don't really understand what his life is going to be like then. It would have been easy to say that is the case," said Mike's mother Linda. "He's got one foot in the road and the other foot behind him," she said. "All I've ever seen is a man with black shirt and nothing behind him, so if he had a bag on he could have made his way to Manchester as well." Mike's body was flown on to Manchester United Hospital's morgue for the treatment of postmortem and remains were expected to be sent for further
