 can also be transmitted through sex and through blood transfusions.

About a third of the world's population has been affected, but the virus has spread explosively across South and Central America in recent months, leading to concern about the birth defects linked to the virus.

In Mexico, where the majority of cases have been reported, doctors have reported more than 3,000 suspected cases of microcephaly since January (or "Zika microcephaly").

"The number of cases is growing," Eduardo Sanchez, head of the country's Commission for Infectious Diseases, said in a telephone interview.

It "is something that we'll have to be vigilant about," but there would be no "new alarm" if it was confirmed that the babies were suffering from microcephaly, Sanchez told Reuters news agency.

Although the health minister earlier this month said there was evidence of Zika-related microcephaly, that has not been confirmed by experts, Sanchez said.

"We all have to be very careful with that word because it can be interpreted as causing brain damage," he said.

Experts have said there is a correlation between the microcephaly and the Zika virus and so far scientists have been unable to explain what was triggering it in some cases.

The World Health Organisation has said it was investigating reports of microcephaly and asked doctors to continue using fetal ultrasounds to detect pregnancy in pregnant women.

Sanchez said he believed the health of the mothers in Brazil was not as good as in other Latin American countries such as Argentina. "But it is not so bad in Mexico," he said.

The government has been slow to declare a public health emergency in Mexico after warning that a Zika outbreak could bring the country to the brink of a major epidemic.

Sanchez said he had just spoken to the US health department and had been assured there was no new emergency declaration. US officials had said they were consulting with Mexico to see if there was much need for the US.

The WHO said on Tuesday it would launch a special international monitoring system to track
