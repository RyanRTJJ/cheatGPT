The authors said that the global threat of drug-resistant infections was increasing.

And while they said the UK was making progress in this area, it is now time for the EU to put its money where its mouth is.

"A comprehensive approach is urgently needed to limit the spread of resistant bacteria in hospitals worldwide, to ensure that the next generations of antibiotics will be able to treat the bacterial infections that are currently the focus of such concern," they wrote.

"Europe has the opportunity to lead in these efforts and, in doing so, can ensure that in the future, people will live to see the next golden age of antibiotics."

It has already been estimated that hospitals in EU countries spend around €1bn (£0.7bn) a year on buying drugs for infections that are no longer adequately treated by traditional antibiotics.

So far, only one of the 17 measures agreed by the European Commission to try to keep drug-resistant hospital-acquired infections under control will come into effect before the end of 2018 - a ban on using last-resort antibiotics for patients who are not in immediate life-threatening danger.

It is now hoped that will be supplemented by the other EU countries by the end of 2019.

But it is the other proposed actions that have most concerned campaigners and doctors.

"One of the worst consequences of the inaction on this is that we have increased pressure for the use of carbapenems - which are the last resort of antibiotics - on our wards. And that actually pushes the selection of carbapenemase-producing bacteria," said Dr Michael O'Brien, director of the Centre for Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections at Imperial College London.

"By giving that last resort at the point of care with a carbapenem, you're picking them up."

While Europe's health system is considered one of the best in the world, there has been a fall in admissions to hospitals in recent years across the EU.
