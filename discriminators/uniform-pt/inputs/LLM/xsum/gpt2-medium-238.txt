 commissioner Steve Wright said there was "no doubt" of wrongdoing. Mr Wright told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There was a process where it was given to these four officers and they came in and were in plain clothes and gave evidence and nothing happened. "When there is some sort of evidence of something being done we are supposed to be there to investigate and the police did act reasonably."

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg described Mr Law as a former police officer who has long worked with whistleblowers. She said: "It is a bit of an indictment on the force, and Mr Wright's comment is indicative of the fact that this was indeed a very well-planned operation and a bit of a travesty of justice."

The investigation heard that undercover officers had taken thousands of letters from people with legitimate concerns about the way in which the Metropolitan police deal with complaints. The letters were not written by the police. Officers at the Met also intercepted phone calls and had a series of meetings with undercover officers to make sure the information was confidential. The force has apologised to those who may have received letters that have not been passed on to them. Mr Law has suggested these letters are real concerns from genuine people with criminal offences. His defence team are still trying to establish its truthfulness before giving evidence to an inquiry.

Officers from the counter-terrorism command had also prepared a dossier on the force's own internal affairs unit and the Met officers they came under pressure to meet before making calls about "preliminary criminal investigations". After investigating complaints about alleged police brutality and conduct in court, the Met is under investigation by the independent watchdog Ofsted as part of a wider probe into how far police can go in dealing with claims of police misconduct.
