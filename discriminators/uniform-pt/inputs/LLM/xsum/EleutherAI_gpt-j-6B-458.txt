 asset, reportedly offered $9,000 for classified materials and information.

The move follows the case of US national, William H. Campbell, allegedly entrapped by Russia in a sting operation in December 2011 as part of a wider surveillance operation in the United States. According to the charge sheet, US authorities lured Mr Campbell to an airport claiming he had won a scholarship to study at a university in Moscow.

It was also alleged Mr Campbell was invited to an event in the presidential residence, while on the way to the airport in a federal government vehicle, agents stopped him, had him removed and then made up stories about a "threat" on his life before he was released.

The Russian authorities believe it was a counter-intelligence operation by the Americans and have issued a statement condemning the methods pursued.

Last year, the Russian security service, the FSB, declared its efforts against American and other foreign spies had reached an "epic scale".

"We have set up a system of active combat, that is, a number of preventive actions. We have created a network of agents and sources of intelligence on anti-Russian [and foreign] spies and traitors in Russia.

"As a result of this network of agents and anti-traitoral operations, foreign and Russian intelligence are waging a total war against spies. At the same time, we have not taken this war into the information or cyber spheres."

The FSB says US citizens and other nationals are routinely targeted with false accusations of spying or of being engaged in anti-Russian activities, a tactic which is used by the US authorities in order to justify mass-round-ups of supposed "terrorist" suspects. Russia's security services deny that this is a tactic to suppress legitimate dissent, but say this is another of their methods of combating enemy agents of "provocateurs" who disrupt or challenge Russia.

"It used to be the method of political repression. Now it is being extended to criminal prosecution. The aim of this is to use the American-style'show-trial' as a method of suppressing social protests
