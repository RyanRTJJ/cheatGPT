 on board.

The Malaysian government says all 239 have been accounted for and "the priority in the investigation and recovery mission is to determine what happened to this aircraft and to ensure it is not recovered." But it has offered no timeline for when it might finish.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that the search is not over, after a United States official told lawmakers at a U.S. House of Representatives hearing that a plane in the southern parts of the South China Sea has detected sounds consistent with an aircraft with human occupants.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry official told reporters Tuesday afternoon that the country was closely following the search's progress.

"We take international and regional developments closely," he said.

Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said at a meeting with journalists Tuesday that the company does not believe that the plane was deliberately diverted. "Our analysis tells us that as far as the aircraft itself is concerned, the only reason for the aircraft to go down off Vietnam may have been because of structural damage to one engine, which is being examined," he said.

But he declined to give a time frame. "As far as we are concerned, we're just following the investigation," he said, adding that "a preliminary answer will be given in due course."

An American official who spoke on condition of anonymity said there is a "high likelihood" the plane was deliberately diverted from Malaysian air space but said investigators are waiting for an international team to travel to Vietnam to launch an investigation.

The Boeing 777, which can fly at a speed of 370 mph, crashed while cruising south of Malaysia with a crew of eight, some of whom have been missing. The Boeing 777 can fly at a speed of 370 mph, which experts say is fast enough to have flown it in the area where searchers have located signals suggesting two engines, a door and a wing piece. At night the plane's pilots could have been flying on autopilot.

A former top Malaysian Air Force official says authorities are looking at an unidentified Malaysian plane's last recorded satellite transmission.
