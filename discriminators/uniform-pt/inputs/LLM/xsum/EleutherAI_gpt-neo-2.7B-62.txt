 teachers and one pupil were killed by teacher's son Aaron Kosmin in Shoreditch High School in 2010.

I am in awe of Aaron Kosmin. It wasn't just him who killed my children, I'm saying. The whole village, from children down to the old people. It sickened the very air.

The whole village from kids to adults was sickened. You can be a part of a mass killing. You can get inside a school and feel the fear and desperation.

When I heard about it I just had to go and see it. I have done a small bit of charity work for different children and it seems the least that they can say is that someone likes to spend time with them. I just wanted them to realise that we have something valuable to give.

I thought, that's worth paying teachers for. It's not for me - I mean there's people who do go through a lot more. We do care, we care a lot.

So we try to give money to those people who need it. We try to fund the building for schools, we do that. There's people who actually really get into that. I see it in different people's lives.

Now you want to bring the children, you come round to see us and you find that the teachers, which were in good conditions, actually have some serious problems.

But we have to look after the children and then we've got to look after the teachers. In many ways that's been our life.

We've been there from day one, and now we've got to find a way, if that is possible, to bring these two groups together and get them into one place.

They were told to stay put, they would still give them their money. They were promised something better. But we just couldn't do it. We can't keep sending
