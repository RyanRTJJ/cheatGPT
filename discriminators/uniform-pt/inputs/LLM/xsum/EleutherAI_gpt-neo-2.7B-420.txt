 best children had an average of 18.5% more chance of not winning the Government's top A-levels compared with their classmates. A separate study also found that the children were more likely to be unemployed, with 41% of them unemployed or on sick leave at least once during the last 6 months.

The children who had been picked out by the universities to receive Government financial support were disproportionately privileged children from the wealthiest families in the country. Almost one in 12 of the brightest poorest A-level children from disadvantaged backgrounds were not at universities at all.

The researchers also found a significant link between deprivation and the chances of being picked. The brightest and best pupils from low-income households were up to three times more likely to be at universities compared to disadvantaged pupils. These findings could be important for policymakers, because the Government's policies to help disadvantaged children into higher education is estimated to have cost an extra £2.3bn in 2013/14.

Children may miss out on top universities as result of their parents’ economic advantages

The findings are drawn from two new national surveys, the National Child Development Series (NCDS) and the English Longitudinal Study – a large study of social mobility and poverty conducted by the University of Cambridge.

The report looks at the effect of being born into a deprived family, including a mother with a low-level of education, or a father who does not work, on the attainment of children. The analysis also looks at a key social mobility indicator, the chance of someone earning less than £60,000 a year going to university.

However, other studies have found that children of well-off parents are less likely to attend university because of their family background. Children from families where the child has grown up in a single-parent household and the mother holds a job outside the home are especially likely to attend university.

In the UK, children who have received free school meals, who come from lower-income families, are significantly more likely to attend and gain qualifications at university than children from well-off families. In a separate study into the effects of race and class on attainment, the researchers found lower than expected attainment results from
