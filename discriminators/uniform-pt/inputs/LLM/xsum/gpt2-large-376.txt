-rower Cooper Cronk and hooker Pat Lam failed to impress as England fought for a win in the second half of the 4-2 series whitewash, with England losing in their first clash since the death of Eddie Jones.

The match was one of 17 matches to be reduced to a single day because of rain, with the fifth one due to start at 2pm on Saturday - the same time as England's match against the Blues on Saturday.

The decision to remove a game from Saturday's fixtures - the seventh all-time - reflects the importance of the final leg of the second Test and two previous Tests against Australia at the MCG, which is understood to have also been given as a reason for the game not being played.

England's Test batting squad comprises 17 players who have had a suspended match.

Former England captain Michael Vaughan suggested that the match should have been played on Saturday despite the rain on Thursday.

Asked on Saturday if England should have played on Friday, Vaughan said: "If it wasn't raining when they were playing then absolutely we should have played on Friday. This is where we are at the moment."

Vaughan had said in the wake of the decision on Thursday that England should have been given a "more favourable" game in order to avoid a "massive amount of disruption" to fans.

"The day off from Thursday, they needed a game in the middle of the afternoon," Vaughan, now a journalist with the National - the Daily Mail's successor paper - wrote.

"So they would've had a longer window in which to have changed their tactics, even if the weather was quite good at the time?

"I also want to say it would have provided more opportunities for David Warner and the others to build momentum, rather than having to run around in the pouring rain, and this wasn't just a case that came down to the weather, it came down to players
