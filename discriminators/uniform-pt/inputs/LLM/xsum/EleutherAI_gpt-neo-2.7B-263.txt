 there is a pride of players where I'm from, which says a lot about the team." The Eagles had their heaviest pre-World Cup training schedule of the tournament and were up against the best competition a young squad has ever faced. And it took real work for them to get to the point where they were competing week-in week-out against the world's best. As far as the Eagles are concerned, it's work in progress.

"To come away with a very well organised team, we are very proud of our team but we also feel pressure to take the next step," admitted coach Danny Broughton. "We are taking steps in the right direction, there will be ups and down. Every game we'll look at our game and ask questions as to what we have got to improve on so that at the end of the tournament we are not too far down.

The Eagles have not done a lot of damage, but they are more than holding their own against the world best and while many would prefer if that damage was scored, the Eagles are in full command. They have lost only one game since February, a 1-0 home drubbing of their neighbours Brisbane. To hold their own is good news to the Eagles, but now they have to keep winning.

The Eagles face a mammoth week against South Africa where they know they must show the world they can win at the World Cup. "I think South Africa will be tough, a huge task for us. That will show how far we've come," confirmed Broughton. It will be the first time Eagles head coach Darren Weir has coached an Australian team in a World Cup.

Broughton says the group he has assembled is all the ingredients for a good performance.
