 Police officers went a long way in making the thieves think twice while committing the crime. So why then did police in London, Birmingham and Manchester make no attempt to warn other police forces in the UK about the dangers of theft?

The fact is that mobile phone theft is one of the greatest crime-prevention challenges to come across our media every couple of years. Crime scene photos make it extremely clear what is actually going on when mobile phones are stolen: stolen items are dumped into the most horrible of places.

Among other things, the report showed that some forces were not receiving figures from the Praes which showed where criminal justice funding is being spent (see table 8).

The report also pointed out that some forces were not disclosing their use of the Surveillance Camera Network Data Network (SCDN-N) as this would mean that the cameras were not providing the security needed to protect the public from crime.

That's why there is such a huge opportunity to secure CCTV cameras in our public spaces, and so much more still to look at on our camera surveillance website.

The report also revealed that the security of cameras is only
