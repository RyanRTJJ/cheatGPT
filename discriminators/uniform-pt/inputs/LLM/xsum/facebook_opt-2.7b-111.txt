 the Bosnian fired home his second goal on the counter-attack just four minutes later to seal Serbia's place in the next round.

Both teams had chances to score on an absorbing opening 45 minutes. The French visitors enjoyed more of the possession, but were unable to find the back of the net. Bosnia were also unable to trouble the keeper, although captain Vladimir Dragic was unable to keep his side in it. The hosts struggled to create clear-cut chances and were kept on the backfoot by a resolute Serbian defence.

The breakthrough came after a poor clearance from Nemanja Radonjic by the Bosnian goalkeeper allowed Milivoje Novakovic to collect the piece of the ball and fire an unstoppable low strike into the net.

The two teams will meet again at the Radisson Blu in Varaždin in the second leg on August 8. The Serbian side have never come out on top in the league. They currently sit 14th on 36 points from 30 games.
