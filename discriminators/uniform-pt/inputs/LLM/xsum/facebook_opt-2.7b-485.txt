"If the UK government is determined to go ahead with Scotland's transfer to a separate and devolved jurisdiction there has to be a deal with the Scottish National Party."

He also described the proposal as a "scam" and "an attempt to trick people from Scotland into thinking Scotland will retain a role in the United Kingdom".
