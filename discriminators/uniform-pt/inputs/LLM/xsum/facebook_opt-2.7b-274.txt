se Perry (5-11) and Ash Gardner (4-27) running riot earlier in the day.

But it turned when Lauren Winfield-Hill (70 not out) and Katherine Brunt (28 not out) hit half-centuries to give England a five-wicket victory with 19 balls to spare.

Faye Richardson (50) and Sophie Spinner (38) also posted important contributions but when skipper Katherine Brunt (4) was sent packing by Georgia Elwiss (1-13), England were reeling at 81-5.

Wicketkeeper-Batsman Anya Shrubsole, promoted up the order to number six, added 34 from 42 balls but, once she fell to Georgia Elwiss (1-13), the innings was in trouble.

But left-hander Winfield-Hill and the more aggressive Brunt fought back with an 83-run fourth-wicket stand which lifted England to a total of 111-9.

The Australians, playing in their 50th Women's World Cup, were set a stiff target but they started well â€“ reaching 42-0 off the powerplay with Spinner (13) and Richardson (3) unbeaten.

But Shrubsole (1-14) removed Richardson for 38 and spinner Kirstie Gordon (3-32) struck again two overs later as Australia slumped to 53-5.

But Elwiss (21) and her opening partner Elle Anderson (12) rebuilt with a 31-run stand from the last five overs, including a four off Richardson, but it proved to be too little too late.

Winfield-Hill was the pick of the England bowlers with figures of 3-16, while Stewart took 2-15 for Australia.

Elsewhere at Newlands in South Africa, South Africa beat bottom-ranked Zimbabwe by 38 runs to go top of Group A.

Laura Wolvaardt and captain Dane van Niekerk were in inspired form with the bat as South Africa won for just the second time in five matches.

Wolvaardt contributed 81 off 104 balls and Van Niekerk hit an unbeaten 65 as the visitors posted 226-6 declared, the most runs ever
