 over the package’s destination which the recipient used to unlock and pick up the small parcel.

Ahead of the drone delivery trial, DHL announced that it used a fleet of 150 electric cargo aircraft to deliver more than 7,400 parcels. They included the one used by Amazon to deliver its products. The UK pilot was carried out by the company’s Parcelforce Worldwide business. Its CEO, Marc De Clercq, said that the company will continue the trial’s progress and consider taking the service global.

“In this project, we are combining the experience and technology of DHL, which brings international expertise and scale, with Amazon’s innovative delivery expertise. We are currently working with the Federal Aviation Authority and regulators to deliver parcels under the drone delivery program in the UK,” said De Clercq.

Amazon started its “drone delivery” service last year in a small part of a suburb in Seattle. In September, the e-commerce giant started testing self-flying drone aircraft in a suburban area of California which included Amazon workers.

The company aims to deliver packages to customers using small package drone delivery system in an attempt to reduce the time customers are stuck waiting for deliveries. The project is taking place in the northern Kentucky city of Hazard where the company plans to deliver parcels via the same drone that would deliver the same packages in the suburbs in Seattle last year.

To prepare the drones, Amazon and other drone delivery system companies are testing several applications. They test applications including package recognition software and data transmission. In the UK trial, drones use a mobile phone signal to track the location of the package for the delivery company.

The first test flights have also involved pilots wearing specially-designed headsets to watch what was being played on a display in front of them. Amazon has said that drones flying at least five metres above a package being delivered can deliver products of any size, though bigger packages may need to be handled manually.
