 to have been trying to sell stolen handguns. This was later confirmed by a man named Chris Evans.

Evans then gave more details to Reuters where he said two suspects had been found with their guns and a handgun. The second person was found lying face-down in the same area with other guns.

Evans said the suspects had been working with the FBI's Utah chapter in cooperation with local authorities. At least eight residents were taken into custody at the scene along with two local fishermen and two US Coast Guard officers.

Some of the families and loved ones of the victims have been told they will lose their loved ones and will be left devastated.

"We could not express what we believe was done," Evans said at a press conference in Oregon on Tuesday night, adding, "We can't say who we are, but we did it out of self preservation in our hearts.

"It's been something we haven't talked to anyone in a long time. And our hearts are broken from this. We're not here for revenge. We're here to stop this. We're here to stop this. And we don't want this happening again."

"I'm sure it's all right, but it won't end here," he added.

Sebastian Estrada, a spokesman for the Utah County Sheriff's Office (SRO), said Friday investigators had been looking for the two suspects for months.

"We are looking for a number of people identified as the two suspects based on social media reports and surveillance images in recent weeks.

"The two suspects are currently in custody. A short time ago we received reports of the men being cooperative with law enforcement in the vicinity of Seccombe Lake Park," Estrada said.

The Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office also confirmed on Monday that two people have been charged in the shooting.
