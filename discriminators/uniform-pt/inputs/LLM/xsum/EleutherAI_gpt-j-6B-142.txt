The 26-year-old, who has beaten Venus Williams and Angelique Kerber on her way to her first WTA crown, said her victory was a sweet one.

"This feels surreal, I've got goosebumps and I'm over the moon," she said. "It is what we all worked so hard to achieve. To top a big event like that, I'm very, very proud.

"This is where you want to be as a player. To be a world champion feels like the biggest achievement I could have. I've worked very hard to do this. I've fought for it, and this is what I've worked so hard for."

In other results on the first WTA Premier 5 tournament of 2017, World number one Simona Halep was knocked out in the second round by Italian Karin Knapp, while world number six Jelena Jankovic got beat by Italian Camila Giorgi.

In their first ever meeting, Karolina Pliskova eased to a 6-3 6-2 win over American Amanda Anisimova to claim a place in the quarter-finals and continue her quest for a record 23rd title.

Also in the last 16 was No 20 seed Dominika Cibulkova, who took advantage of some nervous moments for Halep before getting the better of 19th seed American Varvara Lepchenko 6-4 5-7 6-2.

But it was the Frenchwoman who will face a tall task against the world number one in the semi-finals.

"It's gonna be a physical battle, but when it comes to that stage, everybody can do something against Venus," said the world number one.

"She's the perfect player for that -- always hitting the big shots and making everyone's life more difficult, so that's what I will try to do."

Halep will play Britain's Laura Robson, while Pliskova met world number 65 Anna Karolina Schmiedlova, who beat German Kirsten Flipkens in three sets.

But they were both then stunned in the second round, with Cibulkova coming from a set down to beat the Czech veteran Andrea Petkovic 6-7
