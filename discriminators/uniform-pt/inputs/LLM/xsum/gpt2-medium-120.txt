Mr May refused to comment on the Tory loss in Manchester council, but Ukip's Nigel Farage called the loss as another victory for "The Government" as he predicted defeat for Labour with Ukip on course for 1.8 million votes in England and Wales.

Labour took advantage of its worst result since 1983 to seize on the Ukip failure with its Westminster defeat: the party had said it won't be seeking a majority on this parliament day. Labour also called on Mr Davis to resign after the Tories won despite his "obnoxious" and "absurd" campaign style.

Labour MP Chi Onwurah also demanded an emergency election to replace Mr Davis.


The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.

As Ukip failed to win a seat in England, and with a strong case to defy the government's Brexit plans, Labour is now trying to claw back a fair share of the gains.


Ukip lost Basildon council to the Tories. The Liberal Democrats' loss is just one of a number that follow.


The National Audit Office recently wrote that a loss of 10 councillors at this level of government is highly concerning.

The loss of seven council candidates - two at Westminster and one at Basildon - combined with the Tories' success at London mayor's elections means Labour might still lose a seat if these seats are redistributed to a coalition and a number of council candidates have been suspended or removed from nomination.

At this year's Tory conference a series of Labour councillors who voted Ukip in the current leadership vote were also suspended or removed from nomination.

Labour have always had the largest number of Labour-nominated councillors in our country's councils - more than any other political party but in the past four years only one councillor was Labour local government candidate in the whole of London.


Our loss of local authorities â€“ and the fact that this election has seen the Liberal Democrats rise from 11 to 18 places in the English assembly, is a wake-up call to government that they cannot be allowed to continue.


Labour must fight
