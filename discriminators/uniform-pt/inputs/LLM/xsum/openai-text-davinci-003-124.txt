 and Drug Enforcement Agency, said that these cases are mostly related to drugs, including cocaine and amphetamines. He added that the issue was a major problem across the country, and that the SPA was taking steps to reduce the backlog. He noted that the SPA had invested in new technology and staff to speed up the process of digitalisation and reduce the amount of time taken to process drug cases.

Mr Pearson also highlighted the need for a more coordinated approach between the police and criminal justice system when it came to tackling drug-related crime. He said that the SPA had created “a single point of contact for police forces and other agencies involved in the criminal justice system, through which intelligence and investigative resources can be more effectively shared”. 

He added that the SPA was also working with local councils to help prevent young people from being drawn into drug-related crime and provide support and services to those affected. He also suggested that tackling the backlog of unsolved drugs cases should be a major priority. 

Overall, Mr Pearson outlines the current situation with the backlog of 2,500 unsolved drugs cases. He also stresses the need to take a more concerted and coordinated effort in tackling the existence of drug-related crime by making investments in technology and resources, as well as forming better links between the police, criminal justice system and local authorities.
