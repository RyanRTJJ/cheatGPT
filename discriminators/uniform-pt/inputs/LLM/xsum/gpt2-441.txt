 package approved Tuesday at an industrial scale and set to be carried out in four other countries within nine months, according to Chinese officials.

In other countries, including France, Russia and other leaders, the state-owned conglomerates and sovereign wealth funds will join a massive expansion of public investment and private sector investment over the next seven years to boost exports to the rest of the world, they say. Investment, in particular, is expected to see an increase in GDP above 5tn yen ($1.3tn) between 2016 and 2021.

China says the package could raise a maximum of 2tn yuan Â£6.7bn for the fiscal year 2020-21 by bringing the rate up to 8.1pc.

Some other Chinese investments include state-owned carmakers as well as banks and other private capital.

The move is another test of Chinese investment over the coming six-year period as it continues to develop the country's global economy including the transport sector and new and existing infrastructure. It is due in September 2022.

"We are making a commitment in our development of our market", said Li Guangchen, an analyst at Kuanzei Research. "China has significant economic growth potential."

Chinese officials also expressed hope that the stimulus package is part of a larger plan to create jobs in the energy sector, which is expected to generate a net net job creation of about 1.3m people.

"What is going to be a major change in the industry that Chinese firms can now invest in is the employment in the energy sector," said Li, adding that other sectors of Chinese manufacturing were also likely to see employment growth "because we are talking about the industrialisation of the economy", he said.

Analysts said it was a positive sign for business, particularly the Chinese firms and citizens which have found work elsewhere. "It shows that China is doing more than ever in manufacturing in the US, with China growing faster than the other major economies in the world combined to become the second most manufacturing country in the world," said Jonathan W. Toth, the head of global research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in San Francisco.
