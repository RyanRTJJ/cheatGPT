 powers aimed at curbing its nuclear programme, in return for sanctions relief.

“Iran must take urgent actions now to begin the process of reducing the country’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium to ensure it never exceeds the limits on the uranium stockpile set forth in the Joint Plan of Action,” Mr Kerry said.

This was in response to Iran’s recent shipment of more than 11.4 tonnes of low-enriched uranium to Russia, US deputy state councillor Strobe Talbott wrote on Twitter.

It was enough to make three to four nuclear weapons if refined to 20 per cent purity, according to the US National Nuclear Security Administration, an independent US government body charged with managing and decommissioning America’s nuclear infrastructure.

Mr Talbott added on Twitter that Iran and Russia must agree on what type of low-enriched uranium would be allowed in the framework of the deal.

‘Clear steps’

The deal signed in July aims to keep Iran’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium at about 300kg – roughly equivalent to the annual amount produced by a typical US reactor.

Under the plan, which is known as a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran must also allow international inspectors more access to its nuclear facilities.

Iran wants the international community to agree on a framework for the implementation of the deal, Iran’s UN foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said on Sunday.

“We are waiting for clear steps from the international community to implement the JCPOA … If they do those, in the following month, then we will review the situation,” he told reporters.

The US, along with France, Britain, Russia, Germany, China and the European Union, is still working to persuade Iran to agree to implement the restrictions in the JCPOA.

Iran has demanded that its nuclear work should be exempt from the scope of the nuclear deal, and it has threatened to increase its stockpile of low-enriched uranium until that demand is met.

‘Nuclear bomb’

Iran has insisted on being allowed to enrich uranium up to the 20 per cent purity specified
