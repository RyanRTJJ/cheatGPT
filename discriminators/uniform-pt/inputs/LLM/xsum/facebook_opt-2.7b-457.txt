 and the Outer Hebrides.

A new industrial strategy will be launched for the Northern Isles and Western Isles in May, it is announced today by North-east MSP Ian Blackford.

Mr Blackford will outline the Industrial Strategy in a speech at a Scottish Enterprise conference in Edinburgh today.

He will say: “I am delighted that Scottish Enterprise will be delivering a new Industrial Strategy for the Scottish Northern Isles and Western Isles which will help protect and improve the high-quality jobs and opportunities offered to people living in these islands.

“This is a significant boost for the two regions. It reflects their growing strength as hubs for innovation, creativity, enterprise and international trade.

“It also shows that businesses in these islands have great potential. There is a great deal of interest in them. And it provides an excellent opportunity to secure greater investment.”

The industrial strategy will be supported by a £45m investment in enterprise agencies across Scotland over the next two years.

It comes as Mr Blackford warns Scotland is at risk of being taken off the “fintech map” after calls were made to develop a Scottish version of the financial technology industry body.

He said financial technology and digital banking need to be harnessed to help people become more financially stable.

The MSP said: “Scottish Enterprise’s strategy will be crucial in putting the right resources in place to allow the Northern Isles to realise the investment potential the world has seen in Silicon Valley and Silicon Roundabout and all around the world.

“This is a key moment in the development of economic growth in these remote regions. We must make the most of the economic opportunities, opportunities that could be realised in fintech, food and drink, e-commerce, maritime, and beyond, especially in digital and technology innovation.”
