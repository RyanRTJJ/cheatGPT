nion polls and slammed for gaffes that would make a US president blush, he has endured a public dressing down by his own grandmother.

The Prime Minister was visiting his grandmother in Sydney when the Guardian asked 96-year-old Gladys Abbott for her thoughts on her grandson's performance in office. She did not hold back. "He's doing all right," she said. "But he should be doing better at communicating with the people."

There followed a painfully awkward handshake as Abbott, who has so far refused to admit any mistakes in his role as Prime Minister, smiled uneasily. It was a scene likely to make anyone's grandmother proud, with Gladys Abbott showing her grandson some tough love.

Considering how damaging the PR faux pas were, it seems Tony Abbott has learned a hard lesson from his grandma – never underestimate the power of good communication. What's more, his grandmother's tongue-lashing has taught the rest of us an even more important lesson – that it pays to treat our elders with respect no matter the context.
