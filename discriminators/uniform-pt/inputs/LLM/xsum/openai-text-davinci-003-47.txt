s - the only team to have won the competition three times - and will look to extend their record unbeaten run in the competition, which currently stands at 34 games.

The home side will be under pressure to perform, with the majority of their squad boasting experience of the Women’s Championship, though several of the younger players will be unfamiliar with the unique atmosphere of international rugby.

The much-fancied Red Roses will be boosted by the return of Sarah Hunter, who returns to the team in her 100th international match. Hunter, now a dual World Cup winner, will be joined in the starting XV by Vicky Fleetwood, named as captain for the game, as well as inside centre Emily Scarratt and the experienced Claire Purdy. For the English, it’s a case of taking the team that has been successful in recent years and building on it.

On the other side of the field, the Black Ferns have plenty of international experience, including returning half-back Kendra Cocksedge, as well as forwards Justine Lavea and Blade Thomson.

The New Zealanders will also have a point to prove, having conceded their position at the summit of the World Rugby Women’s Rankings to the now-defending champions England.

Although there is much to play for in the Women’s Championship this year, Friday’s match will be a significant one for both sides. England will be bidding to extend their winning run, while the Black Ferns will want to make a statement and show they are still more than capable of winning the title.
