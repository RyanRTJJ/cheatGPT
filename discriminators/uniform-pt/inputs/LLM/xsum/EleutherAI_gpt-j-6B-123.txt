 by Sir Richard Branson, the boss of the private space tourism company. Mr Branson was accompanied on stage by a spacewoman who joined him in the famous yellow suit to mark the event. Mr McBride, chief executive and co-founder of Virgin Orbit, said:Â "We now have the ability to launch satellites with a fraction of the cost of existing methods. Once we have established the UK government is a big buyer of our services, this could significantly reduce the cost of delivering a communication satellite, which, compared with the Earth, is a very big place. It might also make space a viable way to house satellites. "This is a major step in the development of the global space economy, and a significant day for Virgin Orbit and Tim." The first flight will be of the smaller Rebus orbiter, which weighs approximately 9,000lbs. It will lift off from the launch pad at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in the Gobi Desert in China. A larger rocket and a larger satellite are expected to start flights later this year. Mr McBride said Virgin Orbit was committed to working with commercial customers to ensure that the company and the industry as a whole can help to increase the value of space. "Our business model is focused on building and operating satellites of global importance and putting them in orbit, taking advantage of the vast low Earth orbit. "Our satellite delivery solution has the potential to reduce substantially the cost of providing global internet coverage, increase coverage in underserved and remote parts of the world, deliver enhanced commercial and government services, and improve the quality of life for hundreds of millions of people around the world." He added: "We recognise that there are real limitations to the amount of data that can be transmitted through radio, as it is limited by the available frequencies at which these messages can be sent. "Our mission is to solve these problems by enabling the delivery of huge amounts of voice, video and data services to the very areas where they are most needed." Mr McBride said the space agency could be the first customer for his company, which received a £4m grant earlier this year.
