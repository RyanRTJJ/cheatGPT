"It's got to be just about impossible for anyone out there to catch a seal. It is not only incredibly difficult to catch it, it is also extremely dangerous when you are trying to do so,"

A total of 23 seals have been caught in nets on England's coastal rivers and estuaries so far this summer, the charity said.

One was trapped by a small fishing boat.

"Anglers are being urged to check their own vessels and nets for any damage or foul play to ensure they remain as safe and stable as possible,"

"The Seal Alert message has also been passed on to angling clubs in coastal communities who may often see seals in the water, as
