: 'If a girl is in a lot of relationships... does she really understand what she's agreeing to?'

He also said: 'It would also be good to hear the opinion of the experts on sexual abuse and whether or not the abuse is actually the reason for the mental illnesses.'

His comments led the government to issue a statement insisting that if a woman's sexual past were being used to convict her, it would 'have no place in our criminal justice system'.

The government said that evidence was required of the'substantial harm' caused by a victim's past as well as how it affected their mental health.

As part of the change to how judges will deal with the case, the law will also be changed to say there are various grounds for rape and any of those could be used to prove consent.

The new laws will also require judges to explain why they have convicted someone, meaning that if they are not satisfied it is all the fault of the victim, they could stop a prosecution before it even came this far.

Minister for Public Safety Vic Toews said there would be no case of a woman being convicted solely on the basis of her sexual past.

'The government is making improvements that will ensure that sexual-orientation factors are taken into account in all decisions made in a Canadian court on whether to hold a defendant criminally liable for sexual assault, and to what degree,' he said.

'In order to provide victims of sexual assault a clear path towards justice, it will require a significant change in the criminal law.'

The proposed changes will see the Criminal Code changed to allow for the defence of incrimination based on previous sexual relationships. While this will not mean that sexual past will be used to bring a case, if a person's criminal history affects a decision to hold them criminally liable, the law will allow the argument to be used.
