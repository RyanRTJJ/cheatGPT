 their desks and the children could stay upright.

In 2012, at least 1,500 children left school in protest, while an even higher number took to social media.

The BBC's Newsday website claimed that the issue had been "blamed on lack of teachers", when in fact, it was a change to a government-funded health maintenance organisation's plans to remove "strollers and strollers".

Meanwhile, while the school has a large student body, it has managed to enrol no more than 1,000 students a year since 2008. This is expected to fall to about 700 by 2017.

School of Maths Association (SMA), which represents the local schools, says: "It is very simple. Any parent not supporting the removal of a bicycle seat on a child's school bike seat or their own bicycle's seat does not want for their child to follow in their footsteps."

The BMJ's article about the BMRC has provoked strong reactions from parents.

Some, among them a well-known blogger, said the paper had "mis-characterised" the school's position and "misrepresented facts".

The blogger, Ben Goldacre, said, "The school has no support for bikes. I would be amazed to see this school ever recommend a pedicab in their school."

Others said: "I am a strong supporter of equality. However, the BMJ article could not take into account that the school can only give one choice for the children.

"As a parent who spends hours a week travelling with my family from home to school to work/study, the inconvenience to my children is huge. This does not excuse the school from its duties to make the place safe."

The BMJ's position was that the schools had no legal duty to remove bike seats.

Anita Singh, of the BMRC, said the school had a duty to ensure that children did not fall from bikes and that there was no special burden placed on parents. She said it was up to parents to ensure that their children didn't fall on school grounds.
