 years ago for causing the death of two-year-old twins and two-month-old baby twins at his care home. He was initially released from prison, but a two year term was increased before being granted a six year jail after a further prison term was added. The court heard Mr Khan could have been discharged from prison earlier had he only been convicted of causing serious injury to the babies instead of causing death. During the hearing, Mr Khan spoke of his regret and sadness at the loss of his father, who worked in the cotton industry. Speaking through a interpreter Mr Khan said: ” The twins died, it’s very painful because in the house all the work around the children, the clothes, the toys and everything on, it was all for them, all I did for them. I have nothing to do with it.” Judge Gregory Higgins told him it was hoped that he would have been acquitted had he been charged with only causing non-fatal injuries. Mr Khan went on to tell the court that he had been on the receiving end of racial abuse and the death of a woman in his care who had also claimed he had inflicted injuries. Mr Khan, who has now moved into a flat, said he wanted to apologise and “have an opportunity to live the kind of life he believed in”. A post-mortem examination showed the babies had suffered “motor and other organ damage”. During the hearing, Mr Khan told the magistrates: “I only wanted to do my best for us because we always said that the death of these children was my fault from the beginning, they were born of an accident, my dad died in an accident so they would be my fault, I think everyone has to take responsibility for their actions.” Advertisement
