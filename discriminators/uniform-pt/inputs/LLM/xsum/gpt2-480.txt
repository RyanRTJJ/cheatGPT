"We expect to be able to meet and deliver what I want from the meat market so I am happy about that," he said.

The prime minister said he wanted to help Brazil become the fifth country, after Argentina and Bolivia, to sign the World Meat Quality Certification Programme.

He said Brazil would help its producers "continue to improve products and take a firm stand".

"As a producer we always welcome the new environment we want to build," Mr Temer told reporters.

"This has been a natural progression of growth since the day I came here in 1995, just as we did in the past. Today, we are here at home with no political constraints, and have the best quality of our pork," he added.

Earlier this year he took office and unveiled a package of measures to end "the impunity of political corruption". But he has not yet committed to the package.

The government has taken steps not to enforce trade sanctions and has promised to meet food security in Brazil this October.

Mr Temer said the government would not impose any tariffs on imported meat in Brazil because Brazilian consumers "belong to one of the four producers, the main meat producers of the country."

"We have the choice between the two: a sustainable system of competition and a free market - a sustainable system that gives us a choice... we have to be flexible, but one that is more flexible than the other brands and less flexible than the other brands," he said.

The government said beef production would increase on its current production growth rate of 25 percent from 10,000 to 6,000 tons annually but said it would take time for more cuts to be prepared.

It planned to cut 6.45 percent of its pork by the end of the year. Beef will also be sold in Brazil
