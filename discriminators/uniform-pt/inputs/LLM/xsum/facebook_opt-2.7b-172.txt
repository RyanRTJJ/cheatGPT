 (21) ensured the hosts went to lunch at 58-3.

But England's best batsman in the County Championship this year, Tom Westley, had been out in the first over after the interval. He edged a Cummins delivery back to the bowler after he had worked hard to clear the leg side ropes three times in the Test series. The Australian quicks then had Sam Hain trapped lbw for five by Cummins to reduce the hosts to 79-5.

But Clarke then reached his fifty in 88 balls with five fours and a six as he was reprieved by a slip catch from Matt Prior after hitting Mark Wood for two sixes in an over.
