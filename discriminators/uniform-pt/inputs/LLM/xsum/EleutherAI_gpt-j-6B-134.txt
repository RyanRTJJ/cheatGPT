 city.

At least 27 people were killed when air strikes on the Syrian city of Aleppo hit a school, a market, a restaurant and a medical centre in the most intense day of combat to hit the city since it came under government control last month.

There were also reported air raids, gunfire and explosions across Aleppo's eastern neighbourhoods as government and allied forces attempted to extend their control over the sprawling city.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said some 25 people died. Civil defence volunteers said 17 died when an Aleppo health centre was hit, while government forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad said three bodies were taken from a school in al-Khalidiyah district.

Video footage from al-Khalidiyah circulated on social media showed a school with its walls blown in and the roof caved in. Residents said the school used to be a public one but stopped classes a year ago, and were now used mainly for religious lessons. It was not immediately known whether anyone was buried in it.

"We used to live in al-Khalidiyah and all of this is near my house but I didn't know there were schools here. We can hear the helicopters," said Mona al-Hafidi, a local resident.
