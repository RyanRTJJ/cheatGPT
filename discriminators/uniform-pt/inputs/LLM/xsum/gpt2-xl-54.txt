 anyone with information to call a hotline on 0800 0961 7888. In a Facebook post, Stephen's grandfather, Peter Lawrence, said the family felt the "full force of the police's efforts". He said it was "incredibly worrying" that no one had called the hotline to report Stephen when they saw him at the nightclub. Stephen Lawrence's death sparked a huge outcry and protests in memory of the 19-year-old, who had a history of mental health problems. He had been at a gig that night and left after a dispute with a barman. Two months later a friend told police that he had seen him "standing over" Stephen and was "in a bad way". The Met found the former football star hanged at the flat in south London that he shared with his mother. After reviewing police material from the night of Stephen's death, Mr Justice Garnham said: "The police were aware of the facts as they stood, but no attempt was made by any police officer to make an appointment with a solicitor to make representations either to the deceased at the time, or his family, on the night of his death." No attempt was made on that Sunday morning either to speak to the deceased. Mr Justice Garnham went on to find that there had been "insufficient evidence" in relation to Stephen's suicide. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Marsh, who led the case, said it was a great result. 'Deeply sad' In a statement the Met police said: "We have received a significant number of calls regarding a young man, who we believe to have been Stephen, whose body was found in south east London on 19 March 2010. "We had not received any formal requests from Stephen's family and have decided to offer Â£20,000 as a reward for information leading to the identification and arrest of those responsible. "It was a difficult decision to make due to the great distress of Stephen's family and we thank them for their continued support. "We also remain deeply saddened by the death of Stephen's best friend."
