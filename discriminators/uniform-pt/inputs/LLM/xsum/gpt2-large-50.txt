 a year were on job hunt across the country.

The new legislation also introduces a new type of employment rights for people not currently covered by the Equality Act. Previously, people could only be discriminated against on the grounds of sex or disability, but today they are protected against sex discrimination on the grounds of race and national, ethnic or religious origin.

A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "This bill is a key part of the Government's commitment to ensure equality for everyone."

He added: "Employers must ensure that everyone seeking work is treated fairly at work – we will put a new code of conduct in place to put in place a zero-tolerance approach to race discrimination."

Last year, the Office for National Statistics confirmed that the number of people claiming disability benefits for stress associated with work had soared to the highest level since 2005.

The figures show that in 2015 the number of people claiming disability benefits for stress associated with work rose by more than a third while the number claiming mental health benefits went up by 24 per cent.

In total, around 12 per cent of UK workers in 2015-16 were claiming disability benefits for stress associated with work, rising to 20 per cent of those aged from 65 years and over.

Paul McCallister, Policy Partner at the British Humanist Association, said: "This is a disappointing result that means some people were unable to obtain the support and employment rights they would otherwise have found as a result of applying for disability benefits.

"Yet many people had to make poor decisions about jobs, relationships and future – in some cases even risking their lives – because of them and as a result are now facing a very bleak future."

He added: "We should not forget this was a Government designed to eradicate discrimination and ensure everyone had the opportunity to thrive and succeed in life. There are lots of examples of people going on to get a better life, but too often this happened for the wrong reasons."

"It is time for the government to make clear that employers must be held to account, and these new rights will help them to do that."
