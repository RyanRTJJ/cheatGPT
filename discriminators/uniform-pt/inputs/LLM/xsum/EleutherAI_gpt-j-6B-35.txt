 it was only a “snapshot” of where Scotland is in terms of leaving the UK.

The report from the Scottish Parliament Commission also warned that Brexit could trigger “a constitutional nightmare”.

A joint UK/Scottish parliamentary vote is also expected to take place, but a spokeswoman for the British House of Commons said there was “no indication” the vote, on a Brexit deal, would be held during the week beginning 30 March.

The Scottish First Minister is pressing London to agree to the date set for the Scotland Act 1998 to be suspended next month – known as article 50 day. It is expected to be passed when Holyrood’s Parliament resumes on 24 March.

It is also expected this week for a date to be agreed for any vote by the Scottish Parliament, on legislation being brought forward before the end of the year to prepare the ground for a referendum, to be deferred into 2017.

A referendum has not been agreed in Scotland yet, as Ms Sturgeon confirmed last week. The Scottish Government is currently looking into the legislation it needs to introduce.

There are also plans to set up an interim government in Scotland as early as next spring.

A Scottish Government spokeswoman confirmed: “We are aware of reports in the media that the UK and Scottish governments wish to meet. We look forward to a positive meeting and to further engagement on other outstanding matters related to the Scotland Act 1998.”

She added: “Our expectation is that the new Scotland Act will be ready for a resumption of Parliament. That will be the date on which the Scotland Act 1998 must be suspended by the UK Parliament. As outlined in the recent Scotland Act 2010, Parliament will be asked to give its consent for it to be suspended in the event of a devolution transfer.”

Scottish Conservative MSPs yesterday also called on Westminster to agree to postpone the Scottish bill on leaving the EU, to be reintroduced into the Commons in February – two weeks before the start of the Brexit negotiation period.

MSPs also raised concerns about Scotland being included in the Irish border border question at the heart of the Brexit talks and
