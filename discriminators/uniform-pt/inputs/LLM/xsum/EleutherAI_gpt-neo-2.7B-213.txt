A post-mortem examination report found his death was "caused by a head injury" due to the impact. He was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash more than 24 hours later.

A senior Scottish Police officer who attended the scene later said there had been no road rage and that Mr Bennison had been driving for more than 20 years.

Police appealed that Mr Bennison's death was not 'excessive' and said they had found nothing to support a claim of road rage.

Mr Mayor, who was not named by police, was driving towards Mold from Pontbleiddyn in a Fiat Punto when he lost control of the car.

Mr Mayor, who was not injured, said he thought he had lost control of the car due to not having made a right-hand turn, but later learned that he had in fact not done either.

"We had just moved into our new flat and I was driving him home.

"He was a good son who had a great sense of fun and never met a stranger. He was just a big kid. He had no enemies which is so great."

The road rage plea was launched after
