 hold the notion that Americans should be given the punishment for murder, robbery and terrorism just for such crimes, reflecting a general decline since 1969.

In some ways, Trump's victory is emblematic of how politics in America has changed.

For many decades, the "culture wars" waged by conservatives and liberals about who should be allowed to run the nation were over and done: Those who disagreed were cast out by liberal elites, while those who advocated for the causes of minorities and poor communities also found themselves excluded.

Now, however, such debates can be much less divisive with Trump as the GOP's most prominent and prominent face. One reason is that a Trump presidency would put him at odds with even some of his political core backers, including many religious fundamentalists.

Trump's victory, however, comes at the time, as the president-elect has spent much of the past week courting popular support during a seemingly endless period of speculation about his character, temperament and ability to lead. Some of his critics have accused him of being a serial offender who may or may not be able to be president, based on allegations from his past such as a 2003 phone call with anti-Islam activist Pamela Geller, as well as statements he has made on the campaign trail about Muslims.

That said, the president-elect faces a tough path to unifying disparate elements within the Republican Party. While several candidates like Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and former House speaker Newt Gingrich have pledged to work alongside Trump and his team, others are actively trying to distance themselves from Trump and avoid him.

There is, however, one person who has had success at uniting the GOP ranks in recent months: Speaker John Boehner (Ohio).

Boehner's office released a statement through communications director Brendan Buck on Monday evening that did not directly attack Trump but added that he would work with the new leaders.

Even in a divided GOP, however, Boehner and Trump are unlikely to unite them in a way that would make Trump a less viable president.
