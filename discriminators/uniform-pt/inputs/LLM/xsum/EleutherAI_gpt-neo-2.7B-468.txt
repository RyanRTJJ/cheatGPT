: “We have been really excited to use the exhibition’s location in the heart of London to create a context for this new exhibition, and we hope that the visitor experience will help the viewer explore Tate Modern in a new way.” In this new VR experience visitors to Tate Modern will be able to step inside the exhibition. It will feature virtual reality environments including the Sainsbury Wing and the gallery's main entrance. Visitors will also be able to step into a world populated by London's iconic transport scene and see how Tate Modern and the Sainsbury Wing have changed over time. The experience will be controlled by visitors during the exhibition’s closing on Sunday 20 October. VR technology provides an opportunity for people to get inside a museum. The new experience will also raise the question of whether museums should be using VR to showcase the unique environment of museums in a more engaging way. Museum guides have suggested that the technology isn't necessary in their day to day activity to tell the visitor about the museum, while gallery-goers claim that the technology could attract more people to galleries. The technology has the potential to revolutionise how we experience museums as well as galleries and other venues. It could change how we engage with exhibitions. However, there are also challenges for museums, including issues of costs and funding.

Tate Modern: The Art of Sainsbury Wing is curated by Nancy Ireson, Curator of Contemporary Art & Digital Cultures, Tate Modern and Senior Curator, Turner/Rotimi A. Abubakar Art Gallery, Liverpool and Martin Lewis, Senior Curator, Contemporary Design London, Design Museum, Design Council, UK; with an exhibition catalogue overseen by Johnathan Phillips.
