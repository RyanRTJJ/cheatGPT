 patients and run by North Tyneside Councils, which has taken a £30m interest in the project.

Dr Richard Davies, medical director of the renal department at the University Hospital of North Tees, said the hospital would support the Dumfries development, where he said he had been impressed with the potential of the site.

He added: “We could potentially be a reference centre for these patients.”

The business case is being led by private-sector consultants RCL and includes a range of scenarios aimed at maximising the commercial benefits of the development.

A council spokeswoman added: “Cresswell’s future is an important part of this. We have worked very closely with them on this and are currently seeking to confirm and agree a business case for their development.

“We will then decide in due course when the site can be redeveloped. We know that the Dumfries site is close to the needs of several of our renal patients in the North East and across our wider area, so we are very interested in making sure that we can secure the best outcomes for both the hospital and the wider health economy.

“We will be working to ensure a sustainable patient, staff and patient support programme, together with the development work that takes place to make the site available for these patients.”

The Dumfries development and Renal Care Cresswell

The decision to locate hospital renal services in Cresswell dates from 2001 when the national strategic plan, NHS England’s NHS Plan, identified North Tees as a hospital needing more capacity in renal services.

The new facilities to be created for renal care in Dumfries will be part of an extensive new hospital campus known as the Dumfries and Galloway Hospital Campus, being built at the southern end of the A698 Dumfries-Ayr road.

The site will be transformed with a significant infrastructure investment planned to create new accommodation for patients, staff and equipment. This includes new facilities in new or refurbished buildings within the existing hospital, which will become home to renal, endoscopic, urology and nephrology services.

The development will be the first move in a programme of major improvements which
