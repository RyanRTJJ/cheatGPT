ance" to those who live there.

During the meeting, a resident asked that council support the Fire Authority's ban on fireworks from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., especially over bonfire night.

Resident Ken Johnson said he wants council members' positions to reflect the public's wishes when it comes to fireworks.

"We're asking for their support over the bonfire evening," he said.

Council chairwoman Susan Trosper said she had concerns about people being injured and property getting damaged, even though she knows some people enjoy fireworks.

She said she believes there's nothing council can do.

Council member Randy Dyer said council doesn't have the ability to order the Fire Authority or the village to do anything, but he has spoken with officials several times.

Trosper said a community meeting about the fireworks will be held at 5:30 p.m., and fireworks can be sold at other locations.

The next regular meeting is at 7 p.m., on Sept. 28.
