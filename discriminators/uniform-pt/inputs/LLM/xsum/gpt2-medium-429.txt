You are invited to attend as part of the Great One â€“ The Battle of Scotland tour.

A lot of soldiers are coming to give their memories of the Battle, so get out there and see what is happening today, with an open mind.

To sign up contact Armagh Tourism on 01463 123968 or contact Monmouth Tourism on 01463 718100.

Please note: This is a three day event, we recommend spending one day in one of the designated towns/cities. If you do choose to stay in one of the towns/cities get there early, as our staff will be on hand to inform you of any accommodation options provided.

To visit more towns/cities then click here to see the information for each one and click the 'Check Out the Town' link on the right of each.

In addition to having information about all that is going on in your town we've also recorded more of the history and poetry of the battle to enjoy for a couple of years.

Each of the towns/cities I've listed have been chosen by themselves as the best places to visit in Scotland this weekend for free viewing.

Don't forget you can also watch The Scottish battle scene again on BBC Two at 07:01.
