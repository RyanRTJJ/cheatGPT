 engines for the A400M, according to the IAF.

But a source close to the matter told Business Standard that the Air Corps were "cautiously optimistic" that the firm will have enough space to supply the heavy A400M fleet.

The base that will be used for the air force's main facilities would ideally be in the southwest region of Sindh or in Punjab, the source said.

The decision to change the location of base from Hyderabad to Rawalpindi came after a meeting chaired by Lt Gen Azharuddin in which the current Chief of Air Staff, Gen Air Chief Marshal Nasir Zaman, urged the air force to shift the main air base in Hyderabad.

Lt Gen Zaman in a letter to the chief of army staff, Lt Gen Asim Bajwa, and Air Chief Marshal Nasir Zaman requested him not to relocate airbase, saying that "if such shift is taken, the current air force facilities would become redundant".

The former air force chief has told the air force's officers that he wants them to move out of their current base to New Delhi, he said in the letter.

The air force's current air base is located in Rawalpindi. The air force has recently announced a plan to move operations from Hyderabad to Mumbai in the coming years.

In June, the air force had announced the completion of the air station expansion programme and the purchase of 560 engines from General Electric.

The procurement is expected to be completed by December 2017 despite political differences, the source said.
