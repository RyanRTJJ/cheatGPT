 Deputy and is seen as leading the party into the next election this year.

But the nomination had been expected for years, with Ms Payette calling upon the Liberals to nominate her under the auspices of the Quebec Liberal party, a move that provoked criticism from Ms Payette for using federal funding as a means of giving her party a leg up in the race to replace Jean Charest. This was part of a series of comments Ms Payette made shortly before the election, saying the former Quebec premier should be a prime minister "to help guide the party, not to be afraid the party to lose".

Ms Trudeau is in a strong position to win, with his cabinet colleagues and his conservative Conservative supporters believing the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms will deliver a better outcome than the NDP's.

According to Ms Payette, she was "pleased" to learn that the nomination process had been put in place and that she had been formally informed of her party's support.

"I really was surprised to see that at this moment," she told The Globe and Mail in an interview in Toronto on Thursday. "It was a very exciting moment. I think the most important thing for me, personally, is to know my name and to have a job that I will continue doing by doing something that I feel is right for all Canadians."

A Liberal spokesperson said it was clear Ms Payette was not going as far as to nominate a Tory nominee.

"As the name suggested, Ms Payette will not have an official role in a provincial committee while under consideration until after the 2014 caucus for the province of Quebec. However, there are no new rules that apply to party members," the spokesperson said, adding that she will now have to seek unanimous support from each Liberal branch of the provincial Liberal caucus to pursue the nomination of her party's next leader.
