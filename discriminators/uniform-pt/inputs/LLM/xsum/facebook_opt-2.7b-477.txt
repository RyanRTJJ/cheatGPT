 Cash said: “Our train drivers are right to refuse to run these trains. Their bosses have told them it’s unsafe. It will be unsafe when there are no safety checks by a union to do the job the government is requiring.”

The union added that it would give notice of further industrial action next week.

In the latest episode of Uncut, Chris Burns, the head of RMT’s train branch, says that the Department for Transport (DfT) has been making excuses why the safety of the new trains can’t be guaranteed. He explains:

”We are having this row with the DfT about the safety of the new trains coming onto the British rail network and we’ve finally found that they’ve not got the balls to tell the truth – the trains aren’t safe… it’s not going to be safe.”

The row began in December when the government promised to have new state-of-the-art Class 385 trains on the rails by 2018. However, as the deadline approached, it came to light that there had been no tests or trials carried out by any of the railway authorities.

As the Uncut documentary below shows, the British Transport Police (BTP) have even issued a public statement that drivers working on the new trains are being asked to undertake their training on buses as there is no train.

At the same time, the BTP have been caught fudging the truth over how many hours’ training they have required the drivers at East Midlands Railway, with reports from some drivers being given a much higher rate than they should have deserved.

It seems that this fudging of information has led to some drivers feeling that they are not properly trained and are now refusing to run the trains on the network out of fear for their own safety.

Chris Burns says: “The DfT is being a total joke about what’s going on. They’ll just keep going round… ‘Oh, it’ll be fine – we’ve got all these plans.’ The government is a joke. They’ve got to act.
