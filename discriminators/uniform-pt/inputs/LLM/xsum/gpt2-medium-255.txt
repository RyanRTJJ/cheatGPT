"I'm sick of the media telling me I'm responsible and people just don't want to hear about that." And that's a fair point, Nadja Ensink-Teich said.

She doesn't want other people to become "victims" of her own experiences.

However "everywhere we go, I have people who are mentally ill and when we talk, they say what happened to me happened to them," Ms Ensink-Teich told 4FM radio on Monday night.

"We have to be aware that sometimes we're judged on things we have done wrong."

She described it as "a really difficult time for both myself and my children".

Ms Ensink-Teich wants the Prime Minister to commit fully to fixing mental health issues which have affected their lives.

The 44-year-old has mental health conditions like depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD and anxiety. She is on restricted housing and requires home visits.

Mr Malcolm Turnbull has confirmed he will review mental health care for those affected by homelessness in the first 10 years of his mandate.

According to the Victorian department of home and community security, up to half of all psychiatric patients experience at least one episode as a result of being found in the wrong place or circumstances.

On Tuesday Victoria Police released what is thought to be the first official figures of the number of people found living out of place or not secured in a shelter, or being forced to live on the streets.

Over a quarter of those homeless as a result of a criminal offence were not in a home within 60 days of they committed that crime. While that does not include people under 35, it does include people who have received public security grants.

Police warned families who feel their children are struggling are urged to apply for help from the department of family protection.

"Policing for families has become more challenging as a result.

"Cases in emergency accommodation are up over six per cent this year."
