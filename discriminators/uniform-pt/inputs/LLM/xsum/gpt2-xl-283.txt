Earlier this month, three Malaysian navy ships, a Vietnamese navy patrol vessel and an Australian navy ship joined an Australian-led search operation for the wreckage in a zone that stretches from Perth in Western Australia to the southern Indian Ocean.

The ships also retrieved debris on Wednesday, including a wing flap believed to be from the missing plane, that was found drifting off the Kenyan coast in February and was confirmed to be from MH370.
