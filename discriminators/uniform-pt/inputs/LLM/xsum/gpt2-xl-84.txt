, and the bacteria can take over your nervous system and nervous system tissues, leaving you nearly powerless.

A number of hospitals and medical professionals are reporting that the ticks are arriving on the ground in their patients' homes, as well as in the woods and on the bodies of those who have died.

As CBS News notes:

But experts like Brien are now wondering why more state and local health care organizations have not stepped up to educate communities on the safety of using repellents, or even informing the general public about the illnesses.

"I think the reason I was targeted was because my home is in the mountains of western North Carolina, and it's also on an old military cemetery," Brien said. "If you look on the internet, I got some pretty crazy, scary responses from tick-bite sufferers, like, 'I don't want to die the next day from this disease, but I'm not going along with you.'"

According to a report by CBS News, one doctor said that there is also a high risk of a second tick bite, so the risk of Lyme disease can be reduced by using natural treatments to eliminate the ticks.

Still, many of America's health care providers remain hesitant to treat victims of the disease, even though experts say the risk of Lyme disease can be greatly reduced by employing a properly formulated Lyme prevention program.

"Lyme disease isn't an easy disease to treat," said Michael Rosen. "It also has a long history in this country because, I suppose, it's difficult to trace. It's been a really difficult disease to understand.

"Most people think, 'Ah, if you're sick, you need to get to the doctor.' But doctors don't realize that some people might have a lot of symptoms that aren't really signs of illness. It's a complex disease."

The health department is urging people to check locally for ticks every two to three weeks.
