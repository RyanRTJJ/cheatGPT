The figures released by the Home Office show that while Scotland has accepted more than 600 Syrian refugees, Wales has only resettled 78 between October 2015 and March. This is considered to be a low number and has been met with criticism from charitable organisations. Caroline Tucker, of the Welsh Refugee Council, said the figures show that â€œWales has not played its part in offering sanctuary to those fleeing Syria". She urged the Welsh government to do more to help, saying that the situation for Syrian refugees remains desperate.
