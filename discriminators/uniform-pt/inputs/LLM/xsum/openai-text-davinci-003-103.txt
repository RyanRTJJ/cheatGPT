leaders Serbia by five points with four qualifiers remaining

Wales manager Chris Coleman did not hide his disappointment after his side were held to a 1-1 draw by Serbia in Belgrade on Sunday.

"It's a real frustration for us... We are disappointed that we haven't won," said Coleman after his side's bid for a first World Cup finals appearance since 1958 suffered a blow.

"We wanted three points and it wasn't to be."

Wales trail Serbia by three points with four games remaining and face a tough task if they are to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

"We have to regroup and come back stronger for the next games but it's going to be very difficult," added Coleman.

"I'm proud of the players. They gave absolutely everything and could not have done much more."

Wales have been a surprise package in Euro 2016 qualifying, emerging from a group that also included Belgium and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

However, their bid for a first World Cup finals appearance since 1958 suffered a blow when they were held 1-1 by Serbia in Belgrade.

Wales took the lead through an Aaron Ramsey penalty but Serbia equalised early in the second half and then hit the post late on.

Coleman refused to blame goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey late mistake that led to Serbia's penalty.

"Under pressure Wayne made a mistake but he deserved his start because he's been excellent for us and he's made some really important saves in recent games," added Coleman.

"We'll put the result to bed now and move on to Austria in the next game."
