 least 24 others injured in the crash suffered minor to non-life-threatening injuries. The third girl and her 19-year-old sister both suffered chest contusions.

The victims were identified by police, prosecutors and the families of the deceased.

Hampshire county coroner Chris Cuthbert said: "It is a real tragedy in the most terrible circumstances. I think that these girls, to their credit, took great care in managing their emotions in the immediate aftermath, but at the time, they were very upset.

"It is a very sad set of circumstances and they will have to live with the consequences of that."

All four girls were due to attend school next month, although their schools were not clear.

The girl in critical condition after she was struck by the car has been named as Gemma Hughes.

She is expected to make a full recovery.

Two other girls had minor injuries, while one girl sustained a fractured eye socket. The other injuries were not life-threatening.

One of the victims is an 11 year old girl who has been named as Jade, by her family.

Jade's family have issued a statement through the Metropolitan police.

Mr Cuthbert said of the three girls, "a number of them are in a state of shock. Two are in a serious but stable condition and two are slightly less so."

The accident is not believed to have been caused by drink or drugs.
