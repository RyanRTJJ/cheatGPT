tall any remotely locked mechanisms on its bike, leaving them easy prey to looters.

Wukong Bikes is the latest victim in an escalating wave of bike theft in China, as more and more companies offer dockless bike sharing services. Since the beginning of the year, there have been numerous reports of bike theft across the country, with thousands of bikes going missing from major cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.

With dockless bike sharing services, users are able to pick up and drop off bikes anywhere they like, enabling them to track down and retrieve missing or stolen bikes. To combat theft, many companies such as Mobike and Ofo have developed technology such as GPS tracking or locking systems, to help locate and lock stolen bikes.

Despite the extra measures, riders have been unable to enjoy the full convenience of the dockless bike sharing services due to the rampant bike thefts. To address this issue, some companies have started working with local police forces to crackdown on stolen bikes, while others have put in place stricter security measures such as installing alarms and stronger locks, and offering rewards for anyone who finds and returns a stolen bike.

Earlier this year, the Chinese government passed legislation designed to regulate of dockless bike sharing services and reduce bike theft, and it is likely that more measures will be taken in the future in an effort to provide users with a better and safer experience.
