 will offer its first massive open online course (MOOC) through the edX platform in January 2014.

The University of Texas says the MOOC will focus on a subject relevant to its academic mission of excellence in research, teaching, and public service: Introduction to Sustainability. The course will provide an overview of the most pressing challenges to global sustainability and solutions requiring both economic, technological and policy solutions.

The University of Texas will join other universities such as Harvard, MIT, Australian National University, and the University of California, Berkeley, among others, providing online courses. The edX platform will provide the UT System with an opportunity to reach a large number of students and to measure learning outcomes.

The University of Texas will start with a single MOOC, Introduction to Sustainability, but is exploring the possibility of developing MOOCs in other fields. The UT System also plans to integrate its existing online learning system, UT Elementary and Secondary School District, with edX. The UT System hopes that this venture will further its mission of educating students from all backgrounds and geographic locations.
