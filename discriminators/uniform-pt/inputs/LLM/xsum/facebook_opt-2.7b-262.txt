ause video, it's all been about promotion for this and that," she said. "So I didn't really have as many months to get that thing together and I got to start shooting my own videos at the same time."

Cyrus, 19 is also working on a new memoir. "A good portion of the book deals with my family, my parents and how I grew up, and why my mom decided to become a single mother when I was so young," Cyrus explained. "That was always really special to me, so that's always been a dream of mine to maybe one day write a book about my life or be a memoir writer or have a book that can be in the hands of people and be a good resource."

While Cyrus hasn't thought of her future as a writer, she does have an idea of where she wants to be in the book industry. "I was thinking like 'What are my dreams going to be? Hopefully, I hope to be successful in my music again, I hope my record sells and I hope it does well in sales' like you know, hopefully, like I want to have an album out for awhile one day," Cyrus expressed. "And then maybe a book, I would love to write a book."
