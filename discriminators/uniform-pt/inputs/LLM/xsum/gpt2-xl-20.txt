 the new plant is completed.

The decision was criticised by the former president and first lady Jose Maria Aznar and former deputy prime minister, Maria Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who have long urged an end to the controversial fossil fuel project.

The former premier accused the president's "foolish" administration of "ruining" the future of millions of Argentines.

The government says the decision was taken after a full economic and scientific analysis of the economic and environmental benefits of the new power station project.

Environmental groups have also expressed disappointment at the government's move, saying the project would have created thousands of jobs in the local community, and that the plant would have reduced carbon emissions by 3.23 million tonnes annually.

Environmental groups said the decision had "caused an unprecedented environmental disaster" and was a "monumental failure." The environmental group Greenpeace released a video showing a woman playing the "worried grandmother" card in front of a portrait of Mr Kirchner's wife, the current president.

One of Mr Kirchner's most ardent supporters, Jorge Capitanich, told Argentines that the government had "finally lost its mind" and was now pursuing "completely unrealistic programmes."

"The president of Argentina and the president of the republic have become collaborators of a foreign, fossil fuels corporation," he told the AFP news agency. "They've taken advantage of the difficulties in Argentina to sell their projects."

A government statement said the decision had come after a "period of serious deliberation and discussion."

Fossil fuels and nuclear power account for most of Argentina's electricity and the island is suffering from an energy crisis, with electricity generation at its lowest level since 2000.

There is no other domestic supply of electricity for most of the country where the central and western regions are suffering from lack of potable water.

The new plant will be built near the town of Villa de Armas, which will host a $18.5bn (12bn euro) coal-fired power station that is expected to come
