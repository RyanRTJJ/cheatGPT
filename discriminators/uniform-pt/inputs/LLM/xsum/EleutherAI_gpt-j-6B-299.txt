 that actual production could not be halted.



Afterward, Han held a televised news conference, where she said that the latest threats were carried out intentionally. She said the attack was aimed at the military and was not a mistake.



The announcement was made a day after an unnamed official said the military had informed the US authorities about the attack, and was investigating possible collaboration by North Korea.



The military had planned to keep Han’s announcement on plant designs confidential, but changed its minds in the face of the latest attack, the official said.



The North is known to keep its nuclear arsenal well hidden.



But many in South Korea think the country has been careless in developing its technology to build missiles, with the potential for the country to turn them into warheads.



On Tuesday, some 6,000 South Koreans demonstrated in Seoul against the alleged hacking.



The South Korean president has been under heavy criticism for her perceived inattentiveness to the plant leak.



Many South Koreans view the North as an unpredictable danger. But a survey carried out last year by Gallup Korea found that South Koreans showed more trust towards the North than the US.



However, this trust could not overcome doubts over the North’s possible nuclear ambitions.



The trust gap is the biggest among the 11 regional countries that Gallup Korea surveyed. Its findings showed an average of 67 percent of respondents in the South were suspicious of the North. Some 51 percent of respondents in the South said there was a great deal of mistrust in the North about nuclear issues.



In sharp contrast, some 86 percent of South Koreans in the North believe that the North is a trustworthy actor and only 27 percent are suspicious of North Korea’s nuclear weapons ambitions.
