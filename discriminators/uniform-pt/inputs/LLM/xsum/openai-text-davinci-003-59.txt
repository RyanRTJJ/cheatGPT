h providing unpaid care. This is a rise from 13.1 hours back in 2012.

The figures were released by Carers UK, a charity that supports unpaid carers, who provide both practical and emotional help to people who are elderly, disabled, or seriously ill. The charity estimates that there are now 6 million carers in the UK, up from 4.7 million in 2012. With further pressures on social care services expected in the future, unpaid carers are increasingly relied upon to help relieve some of the burden. 

The charity’s Caring in Lockdown report revealed that carers’ lives during the coronavirus pandemic have been even more difficult than before. More than half of carers said that their level of caring had increased, 73% reported stress and anxiety, and 64% said their ability to cope was limited by their own mental or physical health.

The charity’s Chief Executive, Helen Walker, commented: “The pressures of the pandemic have been greater for carers and the value and contribution of their care more visible than ever.” 

To help ease the burden, the charity has been pushing for better support for unpaid carers. This includes an increase in Carer’s Allowance - the primary benefit that most carers are eligible for - to better reflect the cost of living. Carers UK is also calling for carers to be able to access additional support, such as respite care breaks, mental health support, and training on how to care. 

The charity’s report highlights how valuable unpaid care is to society, and how much more must be done to support these vital community members.
