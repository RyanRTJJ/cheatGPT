 on the A55, knocking out power and traffic lights.

As the animal tried to get home by climbing poles, a road worker called emergency services.

There was even an official video of the foxhound, which emerged online.

It shows the animal clinging to a traffic signpost on the A55 in the early hours on Sunday.

The sight of the distressed animal running around the back of the car sent shockwaves through the motorway for miles.

Video of road worker calling police was shared thousands of times on social media.

It has now been removed from the online video section due to its "disturbing nature".

Wales AMs have called for action to be taken by the local council when investigating the incident.

The RSPCA Wales said it had "no concerns about the welfare of the foxhound" at the time of the incident.

According to the UK Parliament's website, foxhounds can have a "long life" in the countryside and are "able to perform highly skilled field work".

A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: "The RSPCA has raised a number of concerns and issues regarding foxhounds that were not resolved.

"The RSPCA also expressed alarm about the potential risks posed to motorists and the public."

The Welsh Government's Department for Rural Affairs said: "Fog, poor visibility and road conditions can contribute to potential road deaths.

"The Welsh government and other organisations need to be aware of the risks that can arise from dangerous dogs."
