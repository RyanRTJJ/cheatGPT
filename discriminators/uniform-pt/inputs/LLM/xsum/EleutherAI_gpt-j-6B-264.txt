 billion and down by 0.5%, or £4 billion, on 2008's figure. The economy is now estimated to have contracted by 1.3% in 2008, compared to the 1% previously estimated.

The revisions include the following:

The ONS has lowered the construction component of investment from £41.7 billion to £41.1 billion and lowered business R&D from £3.3 billion to £3.2 billion. The depreciation of investments and changes to the classification system have also resulted in slightly lower estimates of construction investment (down £0.3 billion), R&D (£0.5 billion), and a reduced contribution from business R&D (down £0.1 billion).



The ONS has increased the amount of public capital investment, both in the year to the end of September (£2.8 billion) and on the whole for the year (up £15.8 billion to £59.4 billion), due to a higher estimate of the value of work done in infrastructure and public works projects. Also, the ONS has removed the contributions to capital projects from the depreciation of the value of fixed assets (which were previously written off in the first year after sale).



The ONS has also revised the R&D component for the construction of new and expanded facilities and of equipment for commercial and consumer use up to the end of September (£18.4 billion to £17.8 billion).

The ONS said that:

The construction of new factories and warehouses is estimated to have increased by £2.1 billion, while the value of plant and machinery has been increased by £0.3 billion.

The value of fixed assets is now estimated to have increased by £1.6 billion, with increases in the values of equipment for commercial use, consumer durable goods and commercial vehicles.

The value of computer equipment has been increased by £0.3 billion.



The construction of research and development assets and the equipment for research and development purposes has also increased, by £0.5 billion.



The ONS said that its revisions "reflect the latest trends in the construction sector".
