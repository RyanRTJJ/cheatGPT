 preparing for match preparation as well as the games themselves.

Kenny McLean took the reins on Saturday as Scotland manager as the squad began a period of rest in preparation for the tournament in France.

"It's always a good thing for me when we're warm-up we go out and have a game," said Strachan, who is no stranger to playing warm-up games before a big international match.

"They [the coaches] say if you want to learn you have to go up against players who have got good game knowledge and that's where it comes in handy for them too.

"You can see the difference it makes when you travel [preparations] up to Dublin. They say games can be dull at times on the Saturday but you can imagine if they had played games for fun at the end of the week. It would be a different atmosphere."

Strachan says the players were keen to play a friendly that suited the squad. They played in Newcastle and London before their match against Iceland, with the club having said there was an agreement in principle to play the friendly at St James' Park.

Strachan says the players are ready for action on Sunday but it is unclear how close to home the matches will have to be played. He has no fears about the players facing the cold. "It's not too hard," he said.

The Scottish FA are due to announce the draw for the last sixteen at 2pm on Thursday. The group stage draw will take place at the end of the week and, following that, it is the third and final qualifying round.

The quarter-finals will host the Republic of Ireland, the hosts of the World Cup in the same year, in the first match of their qualifying group at the Olympic Stadium, with a match at Hampden's Park also possible. In the third semi-final, which will also be played in Glasgow, Scotland will play a team from France as hosts, with a semi-final at Murrayfield's Fratton Park possible.
