 the graveyard shift.

Workers across Europe, and in the US, Asia and Australia, suffer health disorders associated with working the night shift.

Dr John Harrison, of Newcastle University’s School of Medicine, said: “The majority of shift work studies have been on male subjects but the findings from our large study show that not only is female shift workers less healthy than day workers, but also that night shift workers at increased risk of having a child with a tumour.

“For some women, working the shift night time might mean that they have either an increased risk, or no risk, of passing on a familial cancer susceptibility,” he added.

“Shifting hours, along with the increasing length of night shifts, combined with the large increases in shift work over the last three decades raises the likelihood that working the night shift is a form of occupationally-induced carcinogenesis.”

Dr Harrison has previously been part of another European study which said it is “very unlikely” that the risk can solely linked to working the night shift. He said more work is needed to understand more about the nature of shifts and cancer risk.

“More research on the effects from working shift patterns are required – not just in relation to hormone fluctuations but also in relation to increased noise and temperature,” he said.

“A number of the other studies which are not in line with our results have only looked at cancer incidence and not mortality. To our knowledge, a study of this sort has not been conducted previously and it is important that the health of shift workers is assessed with a more comprehensive approach.”

Some companies have made moves to introduce longer shifts, such as five nighters, to reduce working hours of workers to fit in family time. But Dr Harrison said they should be careful in adopting shorter shifts because of the risk of increased mortality among shift workers.

“The average length of shift in European countries is 7.5 hours and in the UK it is nine hours,” he explained.

“From this we know that working four nights and one day would equate to a 10-hour night shift.”
