 named after the legendary Angling of the Angling, to be put to 'cruel, inhuman and potentially life-threatening use' by conservationists. The Guardian understands that there will be "no permanent ban on or near the seal that is believed to be an endangered species".

Ralph Fisherman said he believes there are other sea lions in captivity who are not particularly good at handling seals. "I think that's not the case, because, as far as our government and conservation people know, I'm against this," he said.

• On Monday, the Royal College of Physicians urged a review into the effects of captivity on species and the quality of its scientific evidence on the scientific question of why seals are killed.

This is not the first time Mr Fisherman has labelled seals an endangered species. In February he called on conservationists to "end our relentless battle for the life of these rare animals."

John Osmond, director of the British Cattail Society, said that "the best way to conserve a mammal that has been around for thousands of years is to stop killing them."

He questioned the need for the Government to "get a grip". He added: "And in the world of seals, we've seen the same thing happened all over. When you give them life, that's the only way to really reduce this."

• Nick Davies, one of Mr Fisherman's former colleagues and a senior scientist at the Royal Institute of Defence, said: "I don't think he's even human. He's not a whale. He's just a wild mammal. I don't think he's a wild mammal. I think he's a wild animal." He added: "The more seals he kills, the worse those seal attacks, and the worse those animals that he kills, the worse the environment for seals."

Asked which of Mr Fisherman's colleagues "appears" to be at risk of being poisoned, he said the Sea Hunter was "very far from being a problem". "We see him all over the world, even when he's not in captivity," he added. "There are no known deaths that occur with the dogs he killed. The Sea Hunter you see on a lot of different occasions
