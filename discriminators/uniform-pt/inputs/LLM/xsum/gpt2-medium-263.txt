, my teammates are coming up and saying: 'You've got a chance to play,' it's unbelievable," said Collins.

"I've had some unbelievable moments of my career like this. I just looked around at everyone else who had played the last few minutes, saying: 'You're lucky not to be in charge tomorrow.'"

The young midfielder has been a regular fixture in Collins' extended squad in recent seasons as he moves to the second row, starting in all nine games played there. The former University of Sydney forward took on another new challenge in a starting role when he featured for the Roosters this week against the Panthers before moving on to join the Lions this weekend, kicking a penalty from 28 yards out.

"I've had a couple of experiences, a few years here and there, where I've been around the club a bit longer than other young guys. That's why I'm excited to face the club I've taken this past season's Origin series with," said Collins.

"I think, as you can obviously learn, it feels a different environment to in Australia. It feels more professional. Obviously, if I'm playing there like I've been playing then I'll be disappointed to leave, too, but I think the NRL club has got a good group of players to look after, and I will be able to get on and give it my all."

Collins has been playing in an emergency backline since missing last round's game with the Bulldogs after the NSW Cup last year following a knee injury, and this week made his NRL debut for England against the Waratahs.

The 21-year-old joins a host of players who have returned, including players such as Daniel Tupou, Tom Robertson, John Folau and Tom Trbojevic.

He has had plenty of experience in the pre-season, and has been rewarded for his performance with a trip to Brisbane for a series of training sessions with the other selectors ahead of the two June
