 be discussing the future of the structure at today's meeting, amid concerns it is in a poor condition and may be in danger of collapse.

However, it will be closed to the public for a day when celebrations are to take place to avoid an incident. The first annual Calton Hill fireworks festival is to be staged on Saturday 4 December.

And Glasgow City Council has confirmed it will seek proposals to turn its annual Hogmanay celebrations on to Calton Hill rather than in its city centre, with the move to be explored if the Ross Bandstand needs to be saved.

Last year, Hogmanay was held on Calton Hill for a fourth consecutive time.

A senior government member has revealed the Scottish Government is ready to consider funding a refurbishment of the bandstand which is used to entertain visitors to Calton Hill during the annual Glasgow Hogmanay festival.

Lord Provost Gordon Matheson said: “We are ready to invest in the Ross Bandstand refurbishment but needs assurances that its redevelopment is not tied to other projects before we agree to contribute.”

Fires ravaged an old Glasgow tower block today as thousands celebrated the annual climax to the British festival with fireworks.

Cars were set alight and scores of revellers doused in a celebratory liquid and climbed the outside of the five-storey building, which was destroyed by flames in the early hours of Saturday.

Witnesses said the blaze brought part of the 19th century tower block to the ground, after an apparent firework went off early.

Smoke was billowing from the highrise in the High Street, which is home to the Hogmanay celebrations organised in the city. Thousands of revellers had already arrived to the New Year party. At least three cars were found ablaze in the area.
