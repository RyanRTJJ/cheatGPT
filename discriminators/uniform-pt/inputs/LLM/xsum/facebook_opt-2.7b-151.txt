 given specific targets to ensure that GPs don't find themselves struggling, the group says.

According to the RCGP, the Scottish health service has just eight GPs serving 1,900 patients in the Dumfries area, compared with 30 in a large city.

RCGP member Dr Alison Strain said that while GPs had to deal with more patient demands than ever, they risked being abandoned by the Scottish government because of lack of funding. "The Scottish government needs to prioritise the health of its population and GPs have to deliver the care which is best for them," she said.

Last year the RCGP made a similar warning about general practice, saying that "the scale of GP workload in Scotland is not sustainable".

The Royal College issued the warning amid criticism of the NHS Scotland budget cut, which had forced the closure of GPs surgeries in Broughty Ferry, Clydebank, Falkirk, Inverness, Orkney and the Highlands.

RCGP Scotland has now urged the Scottish government to introduce specific targets to ensure that GPs can meet demand. Its chair, Dr Fiona Measham, said that GPs needed to be "held accountable for the care they deliver".

But a spokeswoman for the Scottish government said that a national network of health centres would help GPs. "We are committed to a network of four regional care hubs," said the spokeswoman, who added that the government would continue with measures to help improve the quality and quantity of GP services.

General practice in England is provided by a partnership model, with five large regional health services employing more than 13,000 GPs, nurses and other health professionals. The Scottish government also has a partnership model, known as the GP led primary care initiative, with 14 GP-led organisations, but the RCGP has criticised it, saying that plans to consolidate GPs in Scotland into 12 large organisations should not be pushed ahead.

The RCGP has criticised the government's strategy of commissioning the care of patients and called for a change of "focus from cost to quality", which would "better reflect the huge changes happening in the NHS".
