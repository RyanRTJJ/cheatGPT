 in an interview with New Straits Times newspaper that it had been 20 years since a small number of aircraft had flown in from the UK.

He said: "In 2004 the first crewed aircraft from the UK were dispatched to the Royal Caribbean after a huge tidal event on the southern tip of the island on 17 March. The arrival of two crewed aircraft confirmed their origin and were intended for a training event at the National War Museum, but was diverted when conditions were difficult.

"The first crewed aircraft were on their way to Glasgow at the end of November 2002 and the second after some time. In their final minutes they crossed the Channel and reached the coastal town of Barrow and crashed in a large quarry in one of my three homes.

Workman said the ship carried around 2,000 people and was regularly cut off by a high tide (below 50 metres).

The aircraft, which is known locally as the "Shanzee", were to carry out a medical training course at the naval museum. The museum's first aircraft were fitted with a computerised navigational system. Workman said the helicopters also took part in a routine patrol. When the planes collided in a ditch, they were "stunned to see just what an aircraft could do."

Workman said it had been 20 years since a small number of aircraft had flown in from the UK.

Aircraft used in the training course - known as the "Shanzee" - were to be brought back to the UK from overseas and operated by the Scottish authorities.

Workman said a number of aircraft were to be flown there every day from the south of Scotland through the islands of Loch Dora and Tully in the north and the Northern Islands, but were not being moved to the islands.

He said: "The pilots working there have to be a little more cautious."

He added: "They will often go up and
