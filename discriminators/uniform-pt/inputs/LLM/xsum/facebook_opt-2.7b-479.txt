Chennai: A civil court in Tamil Nadu has passed an order that the police should not arrest people booked under the stringent anti-dowry law during investigation and trial, PTI reported on Sunday.

The Tamil Nadu Judicial First Class Magistrate court in Egmore city passed the order on Saturday on a writ petition filed by a woman seeking directions that "no arrest should be made in any court of India for dowry harassment till inquiry is complete and the person tried in the court and punished".

However, police have been told that the accused can be arrested after verification once it has been established that the allegations are genuine.

The court said it was "impossible to understand why arrest has been made while the investigation is in progress from some quarters".

The accused should not be arrested until the matter came up in a trial court, it further ruled. On August 18, the magistrate court had directed police not to register a criminal case for dowry death, saying there was no "sufficient material" against the woman's complaint.

The Court said it would consider the submission made by public prosecutor Pravin Ramachandran that "under section 498-A, any person who is responsible for wrongful confinement of woman shall not be arrested for dowry harassment".

"If we make any order in the present case, can you go without taking permission from the court of a magistrate?" asked the judge.

The court also said that the allegation in the case is "based on a complaint and it is not proved till date that it was a crime". The judge was hearing the writ petition filed by Madhavi Krishnan, wife of Murugesan, who had died early in May.

Thousands of people are arrested every year under the tough anti-dowry law.
