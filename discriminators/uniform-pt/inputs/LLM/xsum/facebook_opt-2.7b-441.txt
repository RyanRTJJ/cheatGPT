 stimulus package of measures totalling 50tn won ($46bn Â£37bn) in total, the South Korean government says.

The package will be unveiled at the Seoul press conference on Sunday.

“This is all about responding to the reality of a sudden downturn, which means dealing with the need to support the economy with unprecedented steps,” Lee Sang-hoon, finance minister.

“We are confident that these efforts will be enough to support the economy by bolstering consumer demand and restoring employment.”

The money will be divided among three measures.

The first is a 10tn won allocation to boost domestic consumer spending. The second is to increase government spending by 4.1tn won (4.2bn Â£3bn), including 4tn won (4.2bn Â£3.1bn) for public works; and 1.1tn won ($1bn Â£854m) for fiscal relief. The third is for the private sector: companies that are struggling to raise money for investment or that face liquidity-related stress will be allowed to apply for temporary capital injections of 3.9tn won. These include small-to-mid-sized companies.

“The measures are designed to tackle the impact of the weak domestic economy,” the finance minister said. “We will also provide incentives for exports and promote exports. The stimulus package will not only be a boost to the economy’s demand for materials but also boost the competitiveness of the Korean economy.”

The plan is designed to boost domestic spending in support of the domestic economy but has also been designed to ease pressure on the South Korean won, which slumped to 14-year lows and has led to a spike in the cost of financing.

“The stimulus package will not only strengthen domestic consumption growth but will also support the real economy,” Lee said following a government meeting in Seoul on Friday. He said the plan would be presented to parliament for approval.

“We will try our best to put up our best effort to deal with the current market situation,” Lee said. “We will continue to deal with any unexpected developments that may arise in the second half
