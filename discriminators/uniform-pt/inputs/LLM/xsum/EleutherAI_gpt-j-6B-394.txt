 replaced for a period of hours, leading to neurological and other symptoms and severe brain damage, and sometimes death.

Oral hearings are usually a last resort for families when other means of resolving the question of negligence fail, such as the courts, the coroner or insurance, and they take place after the coroner's inquest. The coroner was unable to conclude from the evidence that the children's deaths were the result of neglect and the hospital was absolved. However a recommendation was made to improve standards of care.

The case came to the courts after the hospital refused to pay compensation for the mother's $25,000 hospital bill. The amount was set by a court after consultation with the Attorney-General's office.

The hearing in the District Court began in March 2004 and resulted in a guilty verdict against the hospital, which lost its license to be a public hospital, and was ordered to pay compensation for the parents. The hospital was found to have breached its duty of care by failing to inform the parents their son was not drinking sufficient amounts of milk and infant formula and its staff members failed to test their own children's sodium levels.

In September 2007, the hospital appealed when the District Court found it guilty. Despite winning the appeal their license was revoked after they failed to comply with the order. Judge Sinnamon said: "There appears to be a general culture of complacency, acceptance and insouciance displayed by the hospital" and "The evidence indicates that while the hospital staff were aware of their shortcomings they failed to address the problem." They had "allowed their standards to slip with tragic consequences for the family". The mother and her husband were divorced after the appeal.

The hospital had been previously ordered to pay the parents but stopped paying in January 2007 when the court took over responsibility.
