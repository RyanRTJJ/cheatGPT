The council did not deny the city had made plans for the development but acknowledged it was not yet ready.

'Very, very proud'

In one episode from 2013, council executive member of planning, Martin McMenamin said the City for All panel would discuss and endorse plans for the sites.

"They are extremely proud that we are coming together and this is coming together," he said at the time.

"I'm very keen to see it carried out fully, to the satisfaction of everyone in each one of these areas."

He added that the council would "do everything we can" in the project, including its own planning process.

The city's plan to build the stations in partnership with Leeds and the Leeds Regional NHS Trust covers 1.5 square miles from St James' Park through Aladdin Street and St Giles Road.

The council has said it would create 30,000 decent jobs by 2052 while providing affordable housing for a further 400,067 people.

Leeds also has a long list of other cities and cities-plus, such as Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and Manchester, that are in similar talks with the state and London, over a number of key aspects of transport infrastructure in these regions.

But, with the development of more than 2,500 miles of cycle and pedestrian links and the fact London has more than 500 miles of planned bike lanes from Oxford Street to Sainsbury Street, it is now becoming easier and easier to make these links from one city to another.

The city plans to announce plans in the final weeks of December but has not given an indication about what the council is asking for or what money it hopes to spend on the project.
