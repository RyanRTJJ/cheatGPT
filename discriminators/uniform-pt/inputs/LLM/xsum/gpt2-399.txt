 two-tier customs union under the Trade and Investment Bill.

The agreement was hailed as a landmark achievement but critics questioned its impact on the industry.

Wyatt said Brexit would set off a new round of "chucking and screaming" for more firms to leave the EU.

"At a time when it's so important that the kind of free movement we want can happen, and it should happen, we don't see so much disruption in this or that," he said.

Wyatt said the Government agreed: "Brexit and the EU negotiations will make it even harder for companies to get into the EU".

A spokesman for the Minister for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "The Government has offered to allow firms from the UK to leave the UK without legal obligation on behalf or due process to do so.

"We believe that a deal will deliver a firm's return to a secure UK market, and this should be made clear."

The business secretary, Michael Gove, has said he was "disappointed" that talks have come to a "sting-and-shouting halt".

He said: "We can see this is a far cry from the days of big negotiations and a very bad example of how hard it is to negotiate with the UK. It's a very different world from a world of big government meetings in Downing Street.

"Business has to make its own decisions about where it comes from and to make these decisions. But there is no justification for letting others do such a heavy lifting in an attempt to get here."

May said of the negotiations: "Today we achieved the most exciting deal to date with Britain in three short years, but we do need more control in how Brexit is implemented."

May said the Government would consider EU changes to the single market during the deal.
