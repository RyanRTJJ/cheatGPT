, having earlier won a bronze in Glasgow for the third time.

Canada finished with 15 points which was enough to win the gold by three points over Russia, with Sweden two points back in third with 12.

The team from Canada was in an understandably emotional state after lifting the gold.

We're going to need an X-ray machine to count how many medals we've won this Summer!! The joy! #canadasportsman #domegold #cdnmedalla#teamcanada Thankyou for the Olympic experience.. #Canadasportspost https://t.co/WgFf4C3m2c

The final score had the Canadian team finishing with an incredible 18 goals to Russia's 12, with Sweden winning 8-0 for the most part of the game. Canada goalkeeper Laura Schuler made eight saves in the first half, and was perfect in the second half, getting credit for eight saves and winning the game in the last 10 minutes of the match with one shot from the penalty spot.

The win extended Canada's unbeaten streak to 14, and was the seventh time the two countries had met in the Olympics.

"It feels amazing. I'm so proud of the team. After being eliminated the other day and coming back and finishing the semi-finals... it's unbelievable to have a silver and a bronze medal," Schuler told CBC from the podium.

"I'm speech-less. It was so much harder than I thought. I really thought we could have done a little bit better," she added.

The Canadian gold-winning squad also announced that goaltender Shannon Szarpakowski, who was at the centre of a controversy after she was criticized for wearing a poppy sticker to the Olympics, will also carry the national flag into the closing ceremony. Szarpakowski says she is not apologizing for wearing the poppy, but wants it to remind people of the sacrifice all Canadians have had to make to achieve success.
