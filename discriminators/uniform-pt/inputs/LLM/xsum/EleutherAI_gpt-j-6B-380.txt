 Paul Barker of Rathenow Racing (pictured below) rode three runners in the Â£200,000 race at the base near Folkestone and was named best ridden for the second week running.

'We wanted to ride for charity and I've done plenty of work with the Royal British Legion. It's great to take these horses to the top events,' said Captain Barker, who suffered serious injuries last year after an IRA bomb went off on his doorstep.

'That was one of the biggest thrill-a-minute rides that I could remember. I felt like I was up for something bigger. This horse just took my legs off.'

Captain Barker is preparing for a trip to America with fellow Royal Artillery man Captain Gary Lobb, who guided Rathenow Rose to fifth in the Breeders' Cup Grand National in October.

'We need to look at American handicap and turf racing in the summer,' he said.

'He's probably a three-year-old horse looking at his peak. I think he's going to peak again but then we'll have to try again.'

Captain Barker won the Royal Artillery Championships in 2008 in a three-leg heat with Rathenow Rose and a second prize to the handicapper, while he guided the four-year-old over hurdles at Sandown in his only start.

'He's a super little horse that's a lot better than he gets credit for,' said Captain Barker. 'I was lucky to be around in the right place at the right time for the race.

It's nice to have these horses at events like Sandown and Royal Artillery. It's going to give them a lot of incentive for their next season.'

At Sandown, the winner was ridden in good style by Michael Dunlop, formerly of Tullycandy but now of Ballydool, who is the leading novice jockey in Ireland this winter.

Mr Dunlop, who won the novice chase at Cheltenham, rode the runner-up Ballyconnor, winner of the Novices' Hurdle at Navan over the winter. He rode four runners in the race, finishing third, fourth, sixth and 13th before guiding
