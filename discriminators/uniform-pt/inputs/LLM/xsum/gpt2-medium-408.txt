ia Dugdale is also expected to decide on a number of candidates after the party held its annual conference.

She has pledged to "hold Scottish Labour accountable" for what it called its "rash" leadership since being elected the youngest leader in the party's 140-year history on June 24. The SNP party conference is due to start next week after all but a handful of its delegates have been allocated work.

In her speech, Dugdale said she was making "a commitment to the people of Scotland that the Labour party will ensure that Jeremy Corbyn continues in the role of leader after he leaves the shadow cabinet".

She added: "The Labour party will make any decisions that are left to us to do by the people, in which case I will act in the best interest of all parties and the people of Scotland, from which I am now committed to work."

Dugdale has already set out her ambitions for party and will be the first to resign if Corbyn is forced out of the shadow cabinet by her.

Massie said Labour was not making a good deal. Asked if her aim was to undermine Corbyn, he said: "Of course not. That is not our aim at all.

"Labour, as leader of the Labour party, is about reaching out to the people, holding them accountable."

A number of former shadow ministers criticised the leadership changes, with three former deputy chair Jenny Jones and two former communications aides, Emily Thornberry and Caroline Flint, being among eight people standing down.

Miliband and fellow shadow cabinet members Rachel Reeves, Jon Cruddas, Angela Eagle, Ann Coffey and Richard Burgon told shadow chancellor John McDonnell to resign, calling them "corrupt bureaucrats".

Labour lost 18 seats to the SNP in 2014, four by a six-point margin. The party has since gone back to where it finished and the results suggest it has not yet gained a substantial amount of ground.
