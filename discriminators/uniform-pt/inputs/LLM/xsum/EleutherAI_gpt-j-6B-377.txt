 Star are based on data from between 2007-2012 from the Canadian Institute for Health Information.

“We think the opioid-involved overdose situation is evolving and that this type of overdose, as it is being described and reported, may be increasing,” said Dr. Arash Bayazit, lead for health prevention and promotion with CIHI. In Toronto, there were 1,000 opioid-related overdose deaths from 2001-2012 (more than any other city), compared to approximately 250 in the rest of the country.

Bayazit said the figures show Toronto has been one of the most severe hit in the country.

“We had a really high increase (in opioid-involved overdose deaths),” said the CIHI’s Bayazit. “But there is always some degree of noise in this data.”

The data show, of course, that some drug types — including heroin, fentanyl and prescription painkillers — are contributing to more deaths.

But there are fewer deaths because of a combination of the street crime surrounding drug trafficking, and the availability of heroin. The street value for heroin is rising, and this may explain the dip in overdose deaths in Toronto, Bayazit suggested.

The numbers for Toronto are higher than numbers in cities such as Ottawa and Montreal because of the volume of people in the city.

For example, between 2009-2012, there were approximately 1,400 fentanyl-involved deaths in Ottawa. There were 400 deaths involving oxycodone in the same nine-year period. Meanwhile, the City of Toronto had approximately 2,400 deaths between 2001-2012. There were 2,150 fentanyl-related deaths in the province during that same period.

For the Ontario government, a spokesperson said they are concerned about “any trend in the use of dangerous drug substances,” but wouldn’t address drug overdose specifically. “However, this new information further illustrates the need to strengthen our response to this growing public health issue,” spokesman David Rowland said.

“Toronto is in a better place today compared to 10 years ago, where we were dealing with the crisis of drug and opioid overdoses on a regular basis,” said Dr. Christopher Macken
