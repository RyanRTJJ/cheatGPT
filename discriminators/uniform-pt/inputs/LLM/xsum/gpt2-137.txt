 had been tightened following an interview with Scotland Yard. In an interview to ITV's Andrew Marr he said: "We're just going to let her go through."

Scotland Yard confirmed on Friday that Ms McGarry had been in Scotland for less than six months and said she was not wanted by her detention team. She was taken into custody and charged with two counts of assisting police to investigate an offence against the Crown Prosecution Service.

A spokesman for Scotland Yard told the Standard it was "not at the request of, or acquiescence to" a charge of "facilitating a crime", which includes providing false information to police in connection with an offence without permission of the Crown Prosecution Service.

The government said it "would not" discuss such legal issues with Ms McGarry.

Scottish Attorney-General Derek Mackay confirmed that she could receive a full trial on Tuesday.

The CPS's legal team has indicated it will ask for a retrial and have sent a request to the Court of Session for further discussions, but the government won't comment on details until there is further comment from the counsel for Ms McGarry.

Ms McGarry, who is a legal adviser on an anti-tampering law, was arrested after being booked on suspicion of aiding police. Her arrest took place on 11 November last year.

Scotland Yard said it would not comment on details of the case.

On Thursday Mr Hodge was asked to meet with Scotland Yard for further comment on the detention. Mr Hodge told an ITV interviewer: "I'm not going to comment on the criminal proceedings. I just want you to be clear about that. For her to be detained I think is an extraordinary situation."

In May she was convicted of sending indecent photographs of an indecent person and was released after a year but has been living at a private home in Kent for the past eight months.
