 the squad for this season's County Championship when Yorkshire recalled him for the second half of the campaign to offer him the chance to make a claim for an Ashes tour.

If Hameed hits form he will make an ideal replacement for Alastair Cook, whose spot in the side could be under threat when the Ashes are won or lost during the second test in Perth.

Hameed took four wickets in the Lord's test, which the touring side won by six wickets while Cook made 62.

"There wouldn't be any bigger challenge than playing the Ashes, so if I can get on something of a roll, who knows what could happen?" he told Sky Sports News.

Hameed added that his performance on the last tour of India last year was a key factor for the opportunity to play in Australia.

"Being out during that period was tough," he said.

"Coming back and playing for Yorkshire certainly helped with the pressure off. I enjoyed my cricket, I had a bit of confidence and just wanted to play county cricket."

Hameed has signed a short-term contract with Lancashire at present but said he is still trying to work out how he will combine county cricket with England duties.

"I'm trying to fit it all in, but it's obviously quite tricky," he said.

"There's going to be a bit of planning to go along with it and there's a bit of talk, I think, about me having to play the first Test in Perth."

"I've got to think about it properly now and see what I'm capable of. Hopefully I can make the most of the opportunity.

"I haven't spoken to the selectors about it, it's all been through the county."

He added that playing with James Anderson and Stuart Broad helped his cause while Anderson was at the peak of his powers. "There weren't too many games where they were both resting so I was always playing with those two. They're very good friends of mine outside of cricket
