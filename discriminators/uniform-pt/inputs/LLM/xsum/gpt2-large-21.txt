 recommended threshold in life expectancy.

But only 11% of adult men and 15% of adult women took up 60 minutes a week. For men this is three days of total physical activity a week; for women it is three days less and four hours.

The UN's top expert on exercise, Prof Andy Bell, said the trends was worrying.

"There has been a substantial increase in adults who have taken up an average of 30.5 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity an hour [5.6 hours a week]," he said.

"This is a considerable rise in physical activity but, like in all emerging trends, there may be hidden risks.

"The evidence on the short-term effects from such short-term and modest effects is lacking, as long-term effects can only be ascertained on long-term follow-up."

A spokeswoman for the NHS England said this was a survey of the population but said a long-term study had shown that if people increased their daily physical activity by 10%, they could "lower their risk of developing a number of health conditions".

NHS England said it was looking at how individual doctors use evidence to assess their patients' long-term health and could not change advice or standards.

Prof Bell said: "In the absence of any long-term studies, we can only speculate what the health effects might be. What is clear is that a significant proportion of the UK population regularly walk miles each day as part of daily exercise.

"It is vital that we try to reduce the burden of chronic diseases, in particular long-term cardio-motor and cardiovascular diseases.

"A recent study found that those who exercise are at reduced risk of chronic diseases including heart disease, colon and breast cancer and osteoporosis."
