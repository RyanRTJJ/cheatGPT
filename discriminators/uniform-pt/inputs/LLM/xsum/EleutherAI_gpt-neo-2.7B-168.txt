 the preparation of a rugby coach for next summer's World Cup in Japan. It was, however, a big day for a player only nine days old.

In a special ceremony at his mother's home in Terenure, Co Galway, a newborn was baptised into the Catholic Church next to his twin brother, and his mother made a special trip from New Jersey to be there.

After three weeks of treatment, the child's health appears to be improving, following a series of operations. His mother said they are pleased with a successful operation and hope for a full recovery.

The news about the family came just days before the Ireland squad were due to arrive in San Sebasti√°n for the Euro 2016 qualifier.

Gordon Strachan has a special relationship with the Terenure community. In a special ceremony attended by Irish president Michael D Higgins, the former Ireland head coach presented the infant to his local parish priest.

Strachan had been asked by the Terenure mayor, Owen Cahill, to perform the baptism. It was agreed it would take place after the Ireland match, and because of that it is said the Irish press had been kept from the event.

"You never get the opportunity in Ireland to do something like that"

On Saturday the parents arrived from New Jersey for the baptism. They flew in on the day of the Ireland match but were delayed getting to the hospital, which had been arranged through their family. They met at Terenure before the priest arrived, who was "blessed and overwhelmed" to perform the service.

"He said to us after, 'Congratulations on doing such a big thing' and that he had done a lot of these before, he would have been blessed to do this himself," his mother, Kathleen, said.

"You never get the opportunity in Ireland to do something like that."

The team would return to their hotel to be served a meal from the local hotel, then drive back to Terenure together. There were about 30 people at the reception.

The Irish team had already been practising, with players having been in action for three weeks. They
