 believe America should give the death penalty to criminals rather than to those responsible for crimes.

The data show that even as the government focuses on reducing incarceration rates, the country is increasingly confronting a problem that has faced the nation for decades.

In 1980, 54 percent of inmates in state prisons had been killed by their peers. By 2013, it reached 58% in the private prison system (25 states).

In 2014, the number of incarcerated inmates in private adult facilities surpassed all of the state's correctional systems by a greater than 2.5 million.

In addition, the state of Florida is currently under federal criminal investigation over its drug-related crime and high alcohol consumption, according to federal prosecutors.

In a study released in February, Pew Research Center researchers looked at five major categories of law enforcement officials: (i) officers who were convicted of crimes committed when they were young, (ii) those with a criminal record, (iii) those in jail for more than three years, and (iv) those in prison for less than 3 years.

Those officers were considered to have committed crimes when they were young, if they had been released from jail and had not been charged.

They are now accused of crimes when they are young and face the possibility of incarceration when their sentences are longer in law enforcement agencies.

But only one-quarter are still in prison under the influence of drugs (25% of the federal rate).

In fact, only 42 percent have been arrested under the influence of drugs for a year or more.

"We knew drug use was such a concern that we asked policymakers to provide more education about the consequences of this problem," added Driscoll.

The survey of people aged 17 to 24 who used drugs was conducted in July and August 2011.

The data from the Pew Research Center study were collected starting in April 2013 from the U.S. Postal Survey of Americans, released in March to coincide with the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Illegal Drugs and Crime.
