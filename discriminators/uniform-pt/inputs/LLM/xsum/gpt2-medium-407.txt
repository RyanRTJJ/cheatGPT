 1335 to 1340 and was buried in a tomb of limestone about 120 metres below ground beneath St John's.

While the skeleton is the first known remains to be unearthed in the vicinity of St John's College, researchers believe they are the only remains from a skeleton from this period ever to have been found in Canada and were uncovered by construction workers at an unassisted excavation in January 2012 around the entrance to a new building that is expected to bring about a new and improved campus for students and staff.

"The skeleton, known formally as Context 958, was found during some of the construction work on the new entrance," said Dr. Rob Jaffee, a forensic anthropologist with the Centre for Archaeological Research who led the dig near the historic College. "We believe it is a skeleton, although the exact identity of this individual hasn't been determined.

"The find comes on top of an earlier discovery of skeletons from a time in Canada's history, around 1350, which was from a mound in western Newfoundland, near St John's. Those samples were taken as part of an excavation at the church of St John's at St Lawrence (now St John's-Coquihalla) in 2009, when the church is located next to St John's College."

Jaffee and fellow archaeologist Alexei Zaitsev (University of Toronto) excavated St John's College in 2002 and excavations there resumed in early 2011, using a metal detector that can detect over 1000 pieces of pottery and animal bones. During that time, archaeologists also brought the remains of several other people to the site to prove that the remains are the remains of individuals who died very young.

"It's a small discovery, but we have a much stronger understanding of the past and its identity now," said Jaffee. "Archaeologists are really looking forward to building onto the current study, with hopes this will give us even more information. Our main focus is on creating a new context to view the entire skeleton and to analyze this skeleton as a source to help to establish which
