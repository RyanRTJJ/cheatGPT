 brother James, 4, was also diagnosed with the condition when he was just three months old in 2005. Sophia is raising awareness after it emerged that a mother whose daughter with Dravet suffered a fatal brain aneurysm in May had been wrongly told by health professionals in England that anti-epileptic drugs had no value and should not be prescribed.

Their story has inspired The Irish Times' charity fundraiser, A Special Bond, in which readers can show their support for Sophia and others in similar situations. This Friday will mark the deadline for donations ahead of next year's event.

Ms Gibson, 35, from Newtownards, said: "There's so much going on at the moment. James is starting school soon. He is very excited about his new friends at school and his new teacher. He has been in hospital every week to receive anti-epileptic drugs for the majority of this year. All of the medicines he has been taking cost the family a fortune.

"If I could say to everyone who is going through what we have been through, I would say hang in there. The benefits of keeping James on the medication are great, I am convinced, but the price is just too big."

Ms Gibson is raising awareness around the world for Dravet Syndrome, an illness that affects between one and three children per 1000 people worldwide.

Last week, her mother, Lorraine McKee, a member of the Dravet Alliance, gave an interview to an American television programme to raise awareness of the condition and highlight the issue of anti-epileptic drugs as part of The Irish Times' charity fundraiser, A Special Bond.

Ms McKee had initially taken James from home to St James's Hospital in Dublin. At his first appointment, three months after his birth, blood tests revealed that James was suffering from a potentially fatal condition.

He was referred to Professor Michael McGarry, an expert in paediatric epilepsy at Beaumont Hospital. James was then transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, where Professor McGarry was appointed as a consultant paediatric neurologist.
