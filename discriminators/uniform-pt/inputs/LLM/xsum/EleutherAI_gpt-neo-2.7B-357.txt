-based firm fell by almost 30 per cent.

The chief executive, Sir Philip Green, called the financial results a "realist view" of the business over a "very challenging period". He said: "We are reducing our operating losses and expect to further reduce the losses in 2017.

"We have said from day one that the company must be prepared to make these adjustments to fund the transformation of our business. We are also reducing our cash holdings to enable our debt reduction programme."

Edinburgh-based Green described the financial results as "disappointing" and said: "While it has taken several years to reduce operating losses and fund the business transformation, this does not reflect the scale of the ongoing transformation.

"The business has been through a difficult period as our strategic position has become increasingly exposed to weaker markets."

The company has already taken a hit by cutting the head chef and food and beverage operations of its iconic and iconic restaurant, but it is also making tough decisions to restructure the business, and to ensure it can continue to serve London's high-end hoteliers.

The Edinburgh-based firm has just started its rebranding process ahead of plans to move into new premises on The St Andrew's Square site - in a move that aims to become more environmentally friendly.

Meanwhile, the firm is selling the Â£15m London branch of its business. The business, which will be closed by the end of November, sold by GIC Private Ltd, is due to close its office at 18 St Paul's, Whitehall, to Baring Gould in January.
