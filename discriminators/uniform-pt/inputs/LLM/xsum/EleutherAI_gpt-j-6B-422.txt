 aren’t foolproof, and resistance has been identified in some areas in South and Central America, West and East Africa.

The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control began a five-year study of bed bugs last year and expects to share its results with the Public Health Institute, which aims to help public institutions, private organizations and small businesses combat bed bug infestations.

The study examines seven regions in Europe and will involve more than 80 institutions. Participants include pest control companies, hotels and insurance companies. The study will examine factors such as the efficacy of traps and sprays, resistance to pesticides and people’s perceptions of bed bugs.

“I’ve been in business for 35 years, and this is the first time I’ve dealt with bed bugs,” said Dr. Richard Johnson, who runs the pest control company Johnson’s Garden Solutions in Atlanta. “We started using the product, but we didn’t know enough to know if it worked on an infestation. We’re going to make a bunch more beds and walls.”

There’s no clear definition of bed bug infestation, said David Schaum, manager of the insect control company BedBugFree.com in Houston.

“The term ‘bed bug infestation’ doesn’t mean that if you take a step and you find one, then you’ve had a bed bug infestation for a year,” he said. “A bed bug is so tiny that you can miss them, and then you get a second infestation. It’s really like a moving violation.”

The industry averages 10 to 20 missed bites per night per person, Schaum said.

If a visitor spots bed bugs, he or she may be tempted to remove the bugs, but doing so may not help curb new infestations, Schaum said.

Bed bug infestations can be common in hotels. In June 2006, an outbreak of bed bugs in the Marriott Hotel chain in the U.S. led to a lawsuit filed against the company by the U.S. Department of Justice.
