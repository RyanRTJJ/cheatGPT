-pat community was living "like prisoners in a mental hospital" with no access to welfare benefits.

But Ms Proctor has hit back at the inquiry, saying her inquiry will be less focused on criminal charges, for which there is no evidence of wrongdoing, and more on rehabilitation.

The inquiry will take evidence from senior legal figures, academics and others, including the Home Office's former lead on vulnerable people, Dr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP for Leicester West.

Ms Proctor said: "We would not seek, in the first instance, to lay charges.

"We will not focus on criminal matters but on the impact of having people in the community facing a long-term risk of harm and re-offending, as well as the way in which they can be supported to overcome those problems."

Ms Proctor has accused the current government of having "failed" vulnerable patients and said the current inquiry would not have the power to get to the root of the issues it would want to deal with, such as what treatment was in place and whether there were other vulnerable people in the community.

She said the Home Office's chief inspector of prisons is to chair the inquiry but would not be drawn on what the conclusions will be.

Former judge Anthony Horowitz, a friend of Mr Vaz, will also chair the inquiry.

One source said: "There are people with clear links with the Home Office, who are very close to the Attorney General's Office. These people [the current Home Office chief inspector of prisons] will not be able to have a look behind the closed doors without having to go through people in the legal system."

Mr Vaz, a former chief prosecutor in the City of London special crime court, said last year that he has already taken on many of "the most vexing cases about whether there are sufficient alternatives for vulnerable people to avoid re-offending".

"People can be very different in all kinds of ways, and not all of those ways are criminal," he said.
