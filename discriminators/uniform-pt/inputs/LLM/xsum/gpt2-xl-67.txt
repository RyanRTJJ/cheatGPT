Davide Brivio, director-general of the FIA Formula E Championship, said in a statement the incident was "very unfortunate and completely unacceptable.

"We are conducting a full investigation on this incident and will take all the necessary measures against the company."

Porsche said it had terminated the contract of the driver, who had only competed in six races, and could not provide further details.

The company did not say if the driver, a 34-year-old Frenchman, had been a customer or had been employed by it before the accident.

Tunenberg said he believed other employees had been involved in the failure, but added that none were driving at the time of the accident.

He added that the team was going through an internal investigation and would consider legal remedies.

Porsche had been due to attend the European Le Mans Series weekend at Paul Ricard on Friday to drive the 919.2 hybrid, which had also been due to race at the Nurburgring 24-7-365 series.

Instead, it will race in the French Endurance Series in its home country later this month.

Tunenberg said the 919 and its sister car would start building a new team.

"This happened in the middle of a race weekend, something of the magnitude of which we are still learning," he said in a statement. "This incident happened to Porsche, but it could have happened to any team. We will not hesitate to take decisions based on the lessons we will learn from this incident."

The Swiss motorsport federation has opened a case, while the local prosecutors have said they have opened an investigation.

Tunenberg said Porsche "acted completely correctly by the rules of the sport and in the highest professional and ethical levels."

The company remains committed to the championship, he added. "We are extremely disappointed to come to this conclusion on such a short timeframe that would have been necessary to complete the planned program of testing."

A spokeswoman for Team Aguri, which has sponsored the French races this year, said it "deeply regretted
