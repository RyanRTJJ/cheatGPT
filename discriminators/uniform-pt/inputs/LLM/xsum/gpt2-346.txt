 admits it will require a step up in form from his team-mate and ex-Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho.

"At Manchester City he's not very good but he is extremely capable of taking the ball forward and also defending his team-mates," he said. "The pressure in front of you is real.

"He is in a good place to be playing well this season with the new management and that's why it's important for him." [Reuters]

McKenna

While McKenna has been out of the side last season and can still play at left back, his contract expires after this season, a situation that could prove unsustainable for Manchester City. In his previous 12 appearances, he has only conceded two goals, with the club's most recent return coming against Inter on Tuesday when he went on the pitch.

The 26-year-old has already confirmed he would like to leave, though hopes that there can be a change of heart and an offer from the Premier League would certainly be welcomed after signing a new deal in June.

It is highly likely that United will use McKenna on the bench against Liverpool on Wednesday to seal United's first point of the season against Southampton on Saturday. McKenna will not be at Manchester United for this month's game, with manager Jurgen Klopp hoping to give the youngster the chance to show potential in the Premier League.

Klopp is believed to have offered Â£15m for John Stones but McKenna will be available to the manager on the bench with Guardiola keen for a transfer before training at his new club at Melwood. Both teams are hoping to strengthen their squad ahead of a final fixture on February 22, with the first of those fixtures coming at Melwood on March 12.
