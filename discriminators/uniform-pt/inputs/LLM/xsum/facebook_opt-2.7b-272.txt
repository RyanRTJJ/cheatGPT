 model of what was offered to local authorities in Scotland, where the Scottish government has increased its power to set rates.

Ed Miliband will say: "The Conservatives think this is not the case: that councils should not have the power to change the way they do business.

"If councils were not accountable, then the cost that councils have on the public purse would go up and, if we are serious about getting our budgets back under control, then this needn't be the case."

Miliband will criticise the Conservatives for being "wrong on everything", pointing to their plans for tax cuts and their spending review as evidence.

He will tell the conference in his first major speech since the election defeat in May: "For the Conservatives, the only way to pay their way into power is to raise taxes, so they can spend money we don't have. This is simply politics, not politics as usual."

The Labour leader will argue that the Conservatives are "making it harder still for young workers to get on the land ladder and for those who do get on the ladder to do so with dignity".

"The Conservatives must be stopped once and for all," he will say, calling on the Liberal Democrats to make a "bold progressive choice" by standing for an "independent Britain" at the next election.

Miliband's address, which is expected to be the longest speech of the day, will be a key moment in his attempt to reconnect Labour to the party's old-style socialist base.

His speech will take in his criticism of David Cameron's plans for a free-market economy including the plans for local authorities to set their own rates, which will give councils and local government bodies new powers of financial management that the Conservatives are threatening to roll back.

Miliband will attack the Conservatives for reducing benefits to low income families and for slashing public service spending.

In a reference to the cuts in council funding introduced by the Conservatives after 2010, Miliband will say "it is this approach that is the real problem".
