The French foreign ministry condemned the attack and said it was investigating what had caused people to lose control of their car, causing it to crash and cause the devastation in nearby towns.

"What happened is unacceptable," French government spokesman Stephane Le Foll said on France 2 television.

The president of Tunisia said the country remained "at war."

Earlier Monday, Tunisian authorities said they arrested two suspected French extremists connected to the Seccombe crash.

Ansar al Sharia said they were members of the Islamic State cell who had taken up arms in their home country, French media said.
