rt said, in part due to "high demand for 'medicinal' uses".


The report states that Vietnam plays an important role in the global illegal trade in rhino horns, both as a market for the product and as a transit point for its illegal trade. The report cites a number of factors contributing to Vietnam's high demand for rhino horn, including its traditional medical belief that rhino horn has medicinal properties. Other factors mentioned by the report include the belief that rhino horn can be used as a status symbol, and to "bolster the user's confidence and self-esteem." The report also states that well-connected and wealthy individuals have driven the market for rhino horn, with demand fuelled by abundant speculation about the product's value and rarity. 

In order to reduce this illegal trade in rhino horns, the report recommends governments work together to strengthen enforcement capabilities, implement intelligence-led law enforcement, and strengthen legal frameworks. The report also suggests that governments should engage with local communities to build awareness about the consequences of illegal wildlife trade and create messages that target consumers. Finally, the report recommends that governments should invest in research that investigates the subculture of the illegal wildlife trade, including the motivations and incentives of traffickers and buyers.
