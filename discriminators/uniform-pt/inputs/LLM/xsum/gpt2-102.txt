A second tragedy of climate change - the devastating effects of an extreme heatwave on the west coast of Australia

"If it had been 10 years ago, we wouldn't have had a big iceberg, or a big jet from the Antarctic," says John.

"But from 1980 to 1987 we've had a huge melt with a huge amount of sand on the ground.

"My dad was a big fan of those things. He had a lot of money.

"In the early days you would have very fine weather, and it would produce enormous quantities of gas but it wasn't that. It was a very different world there.

"What really really scared me because of it was the fact that there was a sea of melting ice which was at that time at its highest.

"We had not a lot of air space but it was still going on. You had to cover it up.

"By the time we were ready and the ships were moving around, when we could see it coming out of the sea, we were already starting to take advantage of the opportunity.

"The oil was coming back in on the back of our boat so slowly and we were almost getting blown off our feet once the ocean started drying.

"It was amazing how quickly the oil turned out."

But even then, a great deal could happen if the ice on the west-east shore was as thick as it is today.

"It would last for a few hundred years before it started to melt and the world would know that ice wasn't melting and that it was time to go back to where they were.

"We were at that stage in the Arctic with the ice melting so quickly and it suddenly melted, there was an opportunity there.

"So you have to do things to make sure you get the opportunity and it doesn't happen every few years or something."
