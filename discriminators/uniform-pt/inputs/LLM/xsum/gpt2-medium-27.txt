"We'll have a meeting today and we'll come out with a decision and look at people's opinions," Tan told the club's official social media account.

"After talking with fans and players, we'll have a team which suits each players' personality. But this will be the team for when his playing time starts. We have a tough group which we will be working on."

"We're going to work really hard. We're really excited. It wasn't an easy, technical issue and it was completely unexpected to have these discussions and come up with a different kit as soon as it happened but we'll get to see," he added.

"I have been watching his career and there is no mistaking that Kevin will be a good manager and he is working very hard on getting the most out of the players so we can enjoy this time."
