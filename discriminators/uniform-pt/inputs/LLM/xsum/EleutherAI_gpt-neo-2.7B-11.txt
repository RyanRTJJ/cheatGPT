 week at a renal clinic and also gets a low dose of medication to prevent relapse. Ms Nel’s main complaint is her limited income and the social difficulties of traveling in the UK. But she is keen to return home, she says, because she wants her grandchildren to remember her not as a refugee family but as one who “did one of the very best things in life”.

“I want them to tell their grandchildren, ‘we got through it and I’m glad I did’,” Ms Nel says.

Her comments are typical of the many British immigrants whose children have told them how much they have improved their lives, often by returning to their first home to live and even sometimes to go to high school, university or even medical school. These immigrants do not necessarily return with families of their own, but they have given back to their country and to society through their work.

For many Britons, this is particularly difficult because they have had to come back to live in a country where the economy is not working for them. The British are by far the most immigrant-dependent nation in Europe outside Spain and the Balkans. The government-controlled pound makes it easy for other countries to export to us cheap, high-tech and, crucially for our economy, high-wage skills.

It also provides us with an easy way to pay for the services people need, including those who live in the UK and are here as tourists. But we have become a country of temporary migrants, with no way to build the kind of stable economy that would help Britons.

In the UK, this dependence on immigrants is now under scrutiny. A recent survey among Britons has found that more than half expect immigrants to make a real difference to their lives in the future and that more than one-third think people will be better off if their countries have more people from abroad.

One in three say they believe the UK will be better off if foreign countries had more immigrants
