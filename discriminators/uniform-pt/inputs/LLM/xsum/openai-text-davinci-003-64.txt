 he sees us playing," said midfielder Tom Rogic.

Celtic have been in poor form in recent weeks, with just one win in their last seven games. Rodgers will be aiming to steer the club back to their past glories. He may look to freshen up the squad and ensure Celtic compete with the best in Europe again.

He may look to add quality signings in attack – with the likes of Moussa Dembele, Patrick Roberts, and Olivier Ntcham – and in defence, with the possible signings of Virgil Van Dijk, Kolo Toure and Scott Sinclair should help.

The new Celtic boss will also have to get to grips with the physical and psychological challenges that come with managing a club with such a unique fan base. The passion and intensity of the fans has helped Celtic become an international club and made Champions League qualification a regular occurrence.

Rodgers will be looking to fill the void left by the departure of Neil Lennon, who took the club to three consecutive league titles over a three-year period.

Celtic fans will be hoping that Rodgers can bring back the glory days to Parkhead, with a return to the Champions League the end-goal.
