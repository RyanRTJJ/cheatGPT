ics will tell us when the ankle feels better, but for me to come into a game with a stiff ankle and to play against Scotland would not be the right thing.

"We've got to wait three or four days."

The Scots were at full-strength, with five uncapped backs, and with three players who are internationals to lead them in the second half. One of these, Andrew Robertson, scored a hat-trick of tries last Sunday as the side beat Japan 24-6 to top Pool A.

"We'll all be disappointed," coach Andy Robinson said. "It's disappointing because we put in a fantastic effort. I'm disappointed in the result but, overall, delighted. It was an amazing performance and we showed what we are capable of. To beat one side in the first match, Japan, to beat a high-quality Italian side, Scotland, and on top of it we've also beaten Italy.

"We are capable of playing with that ball-carrying ability from Andy (Robertson), the pace of Tomos Williams and, of course, to keep the ball and the way we can use the ball, in the first match, to get a quick ball at the breakdown and get the second-phase ball and take it forward.

"As a group, we have shown that but the next step for us is to qualify, which is difficult, so we don't want to put too much pressure on those guys, but to finish with a winning game. When it's all over and it's all done, I'm sure everyone feels a lot of disappointment, as much as they feel it was a good result and it was exciting; I know I felt it was an exciting game. We didn't start the game in the best light and we've got to carry on from there."

Robertson returned from injury to play, while Sam Whitelock, another experienced forward who played in the second half against Italy, made his return to the side when he replaced Dan Parks.

Japan were the first major side
