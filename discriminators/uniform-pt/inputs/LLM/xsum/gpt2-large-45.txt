 Kenyan aircraft, which killed dozens of al-Shabab fighters, are an attempt to "rescue" Kenya.

Although Kenya has offered an amnesty for those detained in its military operation, many of its troops have escaped. According to eyewitness accounts, it is difficult to escape al-Shabab.

There were more than 3,000 Kenyan troops deployed to the southern part of Somalia in September 2011 in an operation to counter the spread of al-Shabab. When the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab attacked the Kenyan military base in December 2011, Kenyan troops were accused of carrying out excessive killings. Thousands of Kenyan troops were in charge of the counter-insurgency, while about 18,000 troops, including the elite Kenyan Army National Police, were deployed in the south, where Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo was in power at the time.

Alwaleed spent about 30 years in prison in Saudi Arabia. His lawyers argued in 2006 that he was illegally prosecuted in London for al-Qaeda-linked terrorist offences. Al-Shabab claimed that he was being held with a criminal group called the African Union Brigade, which was allegedly planning attacks against the United Kingdom. Al-Shabab did not mention him after him and the two sides have not met since. The first meeting between the two political leaderships took place in London in November 2012.

The meeting ended without an agreement, with the two sides still divided. In August 2013, the two sides signed an agreement on Somalia's future, under which the Kenyan government has been instructed to withdraw troops from the north and south.

Alwaleed's lawyers said during the discussion that the terms of the deal were "stubborn and unjustified". The agreement was not ratified.

On 20 August 2013, Alwaleed announced his arrival in the United Kingdom, where he is living with friends in Barking. He arrived with his son Shibli, 11, and his daughter Asmaa, 10. He is the eldest child of the two most senior members of the Ansar al-Sharia movement. He runs a group that promotes the Islamic beliefs that are at the core
