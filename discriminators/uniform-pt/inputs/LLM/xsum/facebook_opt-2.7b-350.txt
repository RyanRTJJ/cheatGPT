 "the truth is that they've made things worse for people who are out of work".

She added: "We've got a good job, a good job, but I want even more jobs in Britain. I want more young people to have a good job. There's more work to be done. We need to be bold."

Mr Cameron added: "What she's saying is that government is failing, we're failing, and we need to make a change. I would just challenge her. How are things going in government if you were the chancellor - how was the spending review coming on - was that going badly? She's making those allegations on top of the fact that there's still a job to be done."

The SNP is also taking an increasingly negative stance on Britain's relationship with the EU. Mr Salmond used his conference speech to claim the UK would "lose its sovereignty" if it joined the EU, and called for Scotland to get a stronger voice in Brussels.

He said: "Sovereignty cannot be sold at a price for which Scotland's people would never consent. It is only fair that nations which share the same political and legal institutions should also share equal representation. It is only fair that, once again, the decision over our membership of Europe should be made by the Scottish people, not politicians in the corridors of power, nor by Brussels bureaucrats who claim to act in the 'interest of all' rather than for the 'interests, rights and aspirations' of every nation in Europe."

Mr Cameron, in a direct challenge, told Mr Salmond that the referendum was "completely for the Scottish people". Scotland is not, he added, "a colony of the EU".

Mr Salmond said he would seek to campaign to remain in the EU, but warned the UK would be "the last member state in the western world to leave the EU" if Scotland was granted another shot at self-determination.
