 by a Court that was to be informed "of the present circumstances".

"I must say, as I think I see some of you do, that we have lost a dear one in the case, but of course we have lost a much-loved one, and of course we have lost a loyal friend," he said. "I do not blame the trustees for that."

He added: "We are bound by the provisions of the contract to provide for all debts – as I understand, that is a total of 150 days' rent for the premises, of about £12,500, and we should be on our final balance in about three weeks time, so I would advise you to go round to the creditors and collect from them."

The League also declined to take any action against the club or the players. Instead the governing body told the club it was to be treated as a club that had been invited to play in Southern League (a division of Division One, currently in its third division) in the "usual manner", with the same rules as other clubs whose directors had been found guilty of breaching the law by accepting payments from an unlicensed gambling source, the administration said.

The League also said a fine of £2,000 was paid by the club to its creditors.

However, in a letter to the creditors, the League added the Football Association of Northern Ireland (FAIR) – which also ordered the club to pay more than £500,000 to its creditors – was not bound by the Football League's arbitration procedures, as FAIR had not taken the action and was not aware of the "illegal payment of money by Football League Management". It also called for the club to be treated as a newly-formed Football Association club, which was not in its right to do so under the law.

The FAIR has not responded to a request for clarification or comment.

According to the Football Authority of Northern Ireland, the club was given written notice of the ruling earlier this year but did not appear before
