-degree assault over Mr Gray’s death, but the Justice Department’s report says he may have acted in self-defence, and so could not be prosecuted for second-degree murder, even if more serious charges were brought. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said prosecutors were weighing whether to bring charges. The Justice Department report, which relies on witness testimony and video, raises questions about whether the officers involved acted willfully and whether evidence was mishandled. The report found that the officers did not have reasonable suspicion for their arrest of Mr Gray prior to his transport. The van was travelling at about 19mph when it hit a curb and Mr Gray was pinned under it for about 45 minutes, according to the report. The incident is one of five cases under federal review of use-of-force by local law enforcement, following the outcry in June after a video of the killing of Eric Garner in New York showed a New York police officer placing him in a chokehold, and in 2013, the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo, which led to the release of body-camera video that showed the officer had shot him dead. Mr Gray’s death triggered rioting in Baltimore and protests in Ferguson. The five cases are being reviewed at different stages. Some, including Mr Gray’s, are currently under federal investigation due to whether unconstitutional patterns or practices are involved. The Justice Department declined the Baltimore Sun’s request for comment, and The Baltimore Police Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office previously declined to make the officers available for interviews. Officials there previously said they were “considering all options, including federal,” to take the cases before a grand jury.
