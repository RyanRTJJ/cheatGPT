 unveiled its figures for the first six months of 2011.

"This was another successful operation and a massive win against a violent and organised gang, which had terrorised the community of Ballykinler for some time," said deputy Assistant Chief Constable Chris Ward.

"These convictions send a clear message that we will continue to support communities across Northern Ireland in their attempts to rid these gangs of their hold."

Six individuals were charged with offences including murder, robbery and possession of a firearm. One was charged with attempted murder.

Arbib Khatun, 35, was found guilty of involvement in the murder of John Paul Kelly in October 2009.

The investigation, called 'Operation Green', traced criminal gangs who had taken over homes in the Ballykinler area, forcing tenants to move out and sell up without any rent being paid.

They said the gangs would rob and terrorise the community in the hope that they would move on when the opportunity was created.

During the six months of 2011, the PSNI arrested 12 people including Arbib Khatun, 25, and two men whose ages and names were unknown.

Arbib Khatun was charged as part of the ongoing Operation Green probe. Police said he was convicted of the offence of murder on 16 October of this year and handed a custodial sentence.

Investigator Paddy McCarron said that the success of the operation was due to the "skillful and relentless" work carried out by his team of dedicated detectives.

"There are a variety of crimes going on in the Ballykinler area and the perpetrators are intent on perpetrating further crimes, such as robberies and the use of vehicles as weapons," he warned.

"It is imperative that the community comes together with us to expose gangsters and stop the misery they are causing to vulnerable members of our area."

Investigator Alan Black, who led Operation Green, praised "the determination and professionalism" of the officers involved.

He added: "While Operation Green may have closed, we would like to reassure the community that the investigation for this crime will continue and more arrests may follow in the future."
