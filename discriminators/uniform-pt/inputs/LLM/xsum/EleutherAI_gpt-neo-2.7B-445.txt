Infection rates have risen for some years. It is the first time such a rise has occurred since November 2014 when UHW had to temporarily close to deal with an outbreak of MRSA.

A spokeswoman for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said: "Due to an increasing number of infections on the unit, the admissions schedule has been reduced significantly, with three of the four day units now being closed. With the remaining open unit operating at low capacity, the Health Board is now implementing other measures to manage the service as effectively and safely as possible."

She said there were still many staff who would not be returning to work as the infections continue, adding that "the infections on the unit are not in any way linked to the planned reduction in admissions next month. It is not yet clear if the infections were caused by staff or patient factors and it is not known if any infections are linked to patients returning from day care to the units".
