enta combining in the United States (and, according to data, on Thursday the largest American grain trader is also adding GE corn and soybean seeds to its catalog).

In its latest quarterly letter to shareholders, Monsanto said it is "confident" that GMO corn seeds will not negatively impact the price of feed, grain and oilseeds and that "supplementary safety investigations of GM corn, cotton and cottonseed are underway". It also said there will be no immediate impact to the industry.

The group's sales fell 0.9 percent in Q2, the same as in the prior year's second quarter, and the company still is not selling any GE corn seeds. It's selling only about 0.9 percent of GM soybeans.

A recent government study on the safety of GM corn – a key component of Monsanto's most-promoted products, including Roundup Ready seeds – found that "there were no statistically significant changes in toxicity in test animals between control and engineered corn".

A report published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations last month stated there has been "no conclusive evidence" of any damage to humans or soil.

Monsanto's critics in the US have already started to rally.

Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant said earlier this year: "To me, anything that's not 100 percent safe would be a disaster on all levels."
