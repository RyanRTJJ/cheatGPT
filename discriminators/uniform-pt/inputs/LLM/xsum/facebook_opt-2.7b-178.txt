It was described as a "data protection calamity" by the children’s commissioner, Anne Longfield, and a "potential disaster" for the digital economy in a scathing report into the personal data protection bill.

As soon as the bill is passed, the Information Commissioner’s office will develop guidance for companies and individuals to comply with the law. The government says the ICO will provide further guidance "soon after the bill becomes law".

The legislation also will introduce penalties for companies who do not comply with the law, with the maximum fine of £500,000 and five years in prison. The government’s draft bill also sets out the framework for the watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), to protect public bodies from data misuse and will cover the regulation of commercial organisations as well.

The ICO said the new legislation will help consumers and companies to protect their personal data in the same way as they would with the protection of their own private information and provide greater clarity to businesses on their responsibilities and responsibilities to protect consumers’ data.

The ICO will have much stronger powers to hold companies to account for mistakes, breaches and omissions in their duties to customers and the general public. The ICO does not conduct investigations but works with other law enforcement agencies to pursue data breaches and protect the safety and security of consumers.

The Information Commissioner’s Office will also be able to use the European Economic Area’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework to investigate and prosecute companies which violate data protection laws, as well as provide assistance to regulators in other countries from where companies may act.

Although information given in confidence will be exempt from data protection rights, those provisions also allow for limited exceptions. Information would be exempt in the event of "serious danger",
