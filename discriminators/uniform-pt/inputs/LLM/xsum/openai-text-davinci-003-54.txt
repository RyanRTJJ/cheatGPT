atroopers opened fire on a civil rights march in Londonderry.

The Bloody Sunday Inquiry led by Lord Saville found all those killed and injured were unarmed and none of the victims had posed any threat to British soldiers.

The anniversary march was organised by the families of those killed and wounded in the incident, who are still campaigning for justice and prosecutions following the Inquiry's findings. During the march, the families of the victims laid wreaths of white roses at the graves of the victims, followed by a silent vigil at the City Cemetery. 

The march also called for the full publication of the Inquiry accusations, the publication of all de-classified documents, an end to the culture of impunity for those responsible for the killings and for the government to implement all the relevant recommendations made in the Report. 

At a later event, a march and rally, the families issued a declaration calling for the full implementation of the Saville Inquiry findings. They also demanded an end to the failure to take effective action in response to evidence of state murder and other criminal acts in Londonderry and beyond. 

Speakers at the event included the Mayor of Londonderry, representatives of the British and Irish governments and the families of those killed and injured in the Bloody Sunday incident.

The events of the day were covered by a range of press outlets, who reported on the solemnity of the occasion and the determination of the families to continue their fight for justice.
