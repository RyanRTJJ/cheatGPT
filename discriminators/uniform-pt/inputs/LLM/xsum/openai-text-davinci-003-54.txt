the public to "please come forward" and said he wanted justice for his son.

The Met Police's appeal for information has received a huge amount of support from members of the public and various sources of media, including social media and television. A fundraising page was set up by the charity Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, and has so far raised over Â£30,000 for the investigation into Stephen's murder. The police have also used Crimewatch and reconstruction programmes to help gather information.

The Met Police believe that the publicity generated from Stephen's murder continues to have a positive impact in helping to reduce levels of racism in society, and has encouraged more people to report racist incidents. The hope is that the combination of increased public awareness, the police appeal and the reward will convince those responsible to come forward.
