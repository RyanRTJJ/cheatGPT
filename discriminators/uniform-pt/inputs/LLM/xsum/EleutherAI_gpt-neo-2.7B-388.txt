The protest against Nepal's new constitution is spreading across several parts of the country, with a section of protesters blaming India for blocking fuel supplies to India on the India-Nepal border and thereby aggravating the crisis.

The protestors were protesting peacefully on Saturday against the new law governing the judiciary and parliament.

India has rejected all accusations of blocking the fuel supplies.

Indian officials have informed the protestors that they do have the capacity to transport the fuel, PTI has reported. However, as the protestors had taken shelter in the country's border, the officials had taken the measures to ensure that fuel was carried in due course.

However, the protestors are now demanding fuel supplies on the India-Nepal border, the PTI has reported, quoting sources.

Nepal does not have oil products to be imported, so the fuel should be transported by India," PTI reported quoting sources, as saying on Saturday. However, the protestors have so far blocked fuel supply on the India-Nepal border.

The protesters have claimed that they have been protesting for two weeks that the government has been illegally passing new laws without an approval of the
