 which would bring new jobs to the area. But the project was met with criticism from a local think-tank which claimed it would be ecologically damaging, and that it could "endanger water quality."

A spokesman for Bord Iascaighe said that the hydro-electric works would be "a new and important source of local employment and income".

But the environmental group Friends of the Earth is backing the project. They claim the works would pose an "extreme environmental risk" to the area and should be "the least of the concerns". In particular they said that a "massive reservoir - similar in size and shape to Corgas - would be built next to the River Gala at the head of the Gala Water." The reservoir would hold water equivalent to one large lake.

Friends of the Earth's director of campaigns Tim Smith said: "The site could be a big danger to the River Gala, it could see the water flowing further and making it more polluted. Water quality is already being negatively affected by coal fired power stations and sewage plants."

But it's the plans for the hydro-electric generators that cause controversy on the local and regional scales. Campaign groups on behalf of the villagers worry that the proposed Galashiels Hydro-electric Generation Project could see the area's population boom. The work is being proposed on an estimated area of 3,500 hectares, which would bring new jobs in the rural community.

The Gala Hydro-electric Generation Project would provide electricity for the community.

At present all the Galashiels Water Power scheme includes three hydro-electric generating stations, and a new water storage reservoir across the river.

Galashiels Town Council have rejected the proposed plans claiming it could lead to a "massive and catastrophic impact on the local community" and would have a negative impact on the quality of the river.

Local groups and campaigners have launched a campaign to try and stop the scheme at the local level. But the proposal for the Galashiels Hydro-electric Generation Project still looks set to go ahead, and is to be discussed by the local and regional authorities today.
