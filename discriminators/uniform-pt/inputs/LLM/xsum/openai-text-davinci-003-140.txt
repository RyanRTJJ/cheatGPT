l has already expressed her disappointment. 

Dear Ms. Bell, 

I hope this finds you well. I understand the disappointment you have expressed about your missing cousin and the apology received from the senior Police Scotland officer. I am writing to ask if you are aware of any information that could help locate your missing relative. I understand if this is too painful a subject to discuss, but it would be extremely valuable if you have any knowledge, even if it is a hunch, on the whereabouts of your cousin. 

Thank you very much in advance for your help.

Sincerely, 
[Name]
