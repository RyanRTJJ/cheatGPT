he gang was tracked down and cornered by police. The siege, which saw specialist armed officers fire thousands of rounds at the gang’s hide-out, captured the imagination of the public, who gathered to watch the drama unfold in the streets of Stepney. 

The incident began when officers of the Metropolitan Police Force’s H Division, led by Inspector George Gardstein, responded to reports of an attempted burglary at a jeweller’s shop in Houndsditch. As the officers entered the shop, the suspects opened fire, killing three of them, Sergeant Robert Bentley, Constable Charles Tucker and Constable Walter Choate. Several suspects escaped during the gunfight, and despite the quick response of officers from nearby towns, the perpetrators had fled the scene almost as soon as they had arrived. 

A search was launched to track down the criminals, which led police to a house on Sidney Street in east London. Specialist firearms officers took up positions outside the building, which had been identified as the gang’s hideout, and after a tense stand-off that lasted nine hours, the incident ended with the capture of two of the suspects. The remaining suspects either escaped or were killed during the siege. 

The siege of Sidney Street was one of the most dramatic police operations in British history, and its legacy still resonates today. It established the Metropolitan Police as a national force capable of dealing with serious organised crime, and it demonstrated the value of firearms training for police officers. It also showed the public the necessity of co-operation between police and the military in extreme emergencies.
