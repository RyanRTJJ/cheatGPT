 and Clyde issued a statement saying that the inspection team had found no evidence of patient harm in any of the hospitals examined, but had uncovered "serious management areas for improvement."

It adds that those areas needed to be corrected. The problem was identified by the Healthcare Compliance Department of the College of Nursing and Midwifery.

However, the Scottish Government will not be providing funding to the health boards to improve training across NHS GGC areas. Instead it will be funding the Scottish Nurses' Inspectorate to create a new register of standards set by the college for all healthcare organizations in Scotland.

NHS Trusts

A Department for Health spokesperson said that the health service trusts "are already implementing the new standards". In addition to this, the spokesperson stated that all NHS Trusts in Scotland that do not have a minimum level of standards need to submit to scrutiny before being certified as a trust by their registered NHS board; all other trusts are already compliant according to this newly adopted standard.

There are only about 150 NHS Trusts in Scotland; NHS Chief Executive Paul Anderson said the number is going to increase as local health boards introduce reforms in their local areas of service delivery.

The statement said that "The Scottish Government funding decision was based to ensure that local health boards could implement the standard to enable trusts to continue to work, but it also represents an opportunity for the trust sector to raise standards within their areas of delivery. It enables all trusts to work in compliance with the new standards that will be embedded in all healthcare trusts. The Scottish Government funding decision also means that all NHS Trusts will now be able to access the new standards that the Scottish government has developed and is introducing. The public will be better protected when trusts in different areas undertake the same checks and the same improvements before they can be certified or accredited as a trust. The standards developed are based on both national and local knowledge, including the opinions of nurses and GPs, experts from the NHS Scotland, Healthcare Compliance,
