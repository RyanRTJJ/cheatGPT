 among young people.

But there is a big caveat with the research at the University of Minnesota, where researchers report this month a small but significant rise in reported Lyme disease cases in western Minnesota, as well as in southeastern North America. The study did not report how many of those cases were true cases and how many were unfounded cases.

The Minnesota University researchers used Minnesota Department of Health's state medical registry to record whether someone in Minnesota has been diagnosed with Lyme disease since 1997. They reported only when someone reported having a diagnosis of the disease.

In both the 2000 and 2009 medical records, 13 percent of patients who received the diagnosis of Lyme disease had been diagnosed previously.

This was a substantial increase, from 2.1 percent in 2000 to 5.9 percent in 2009.

The Minnesota research is the first to report that many Lyme disease cases in Minnesota are untreatably. The disease is usually treated with antibiotics, but the medications can cause side effects including nausea, headaches and joint pain. The disease can be fatal if untreated.

Dr. Edward Tromovski, an infectious disease specialist with the Minnesota Department of Health, said that the number of cases of Lyme disease in Minnesota could grow, especially in young and elderly people who are not taking the medications or even have chronic illnesses that can put them at increased risk.

"Our recommendation is to be vigilant and treat those people," Tromovski said. "We're trying to protect everybody. But we're certainly concerned about more cases."

"We've been talking to people, talking to patients, finding that people are going to the doctors who are not getting the care they need," Tromovski said.

Tromovski noted that Minnesota has been at the forefront of the Lyme disease research field and is a national leader in Lyme disease diagnosis.

"So it's more than just somebody having been diagnosed," Tromovski said. "We've found Lyme disease in our patients."

The Minnesota researchers found that the number of reported Lyme disease cases in the state has tripled since the 1950s. These increases could be caused by multiple factors, including an increase in the number of cases not being reported.

Tromovski said they have
