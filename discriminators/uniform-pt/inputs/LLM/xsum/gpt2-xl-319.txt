 have a carer's assistant, and that there is a 'back up plan' for the carer to meet with family and friends if the individual fails to do so.

The report found that while the majority (74%) of care workers did this "satisfactorily", it was "disaster waiting" to happen â€“ 41% of care workers who experienced a fall in carer attendance had taken further action, such as sending the individual to group support to help them, or offering the individual a break. However, NICE advises carers they be patient with care assistants, advising them to do what they can, rather than taking punitive action. Care employers are advised to do what they can to ensure carers can make sure they regularly attend and that the work they do is enjoyable, so they might also be encouraged to give feedback to a carer.

Ofsted found that some employers reported that their care worker policy was too informal (such as a "well done if you see me" approach). NICE says this practice sends out the wrong message, and that employers must consider how employees and organisations should meet on a regular basis.

What's the right approach?

So what's an employer to do instead?

Don't be afraid to offer an incentive

A carer's fee, or 'nanny bonus', could give the employee and the employee's family extra money a day, or even monthly, at no added charge to the employer. Or employers might consider providing free childcare for carers. This would help both worker and employer.

Offer regular training

Make sure the employee knows about work related activities and has had opportunities to take part at a level appropriate to their needs. It might be helpful to offer additional training in a wider range of environments through local voluntary organisations and on the employer's own website.

Offer flexible behaviour

The report recommends employers take a more relaxed attitude to care staff who are struggling with "change or difficulty". This could include having weekly or fortnightly 'call in' days when the person is able to call in to set up appointments and to ask questions of a member of staff or a carer. This would include people who work in nursing and adult children's homes, who may not have
