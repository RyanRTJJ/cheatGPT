 Matt Dawson will appear in the sevens for USA Eagles in Dublin.

England captain Mike Tindall, whose team won the Rugby World Cup for the only time in its history in 2015, told BBC Radio 5 live: "I don't think sevens in general will ever catch on.

"You look at football. People love to watch the football in the summer - you don't see sevens in the summer time.

"It is similar to the rugby sevens - they play a game which you can see, on TV, every weekend. Rugby 7s, I have to be honest with you, the only place that works is at the Commonwealth Games."

Former England and British and Irish Lions back-rower Dawson said: "It's great for England to be the first country to hold a sevens World Cup."

He added: "I am doing a stint on a tour with the USA Eagles and so I won't be part of the World Series, but it's a great opportunity to play for your country where all the eyes are on you.

"You've got to take the opportunity and make the most of it. But I always look at sevens and I think it's a great game to watch."

Nations from the Commonwealth of Nations feature in the six-team, one-day World Series in Scotland, while the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Kenya and Fiji fight it out for the World Series title.

The World Series in Scotland follows two sevens tours: the Hong Kong Sevens with Hong Kong, India, South Africa and Wales, and the Commonwealth Games with the hosts, Scotland, England, Samoa, Fiji and South Africa.

England won both tournaments with the same team: the Lions and England sevens team.

It won the World Cup for the first time as an individual squad, with flanker Tom Wood at fly-half, and for the first time overall after also winning the 2009 and 2011 RBS Churchill Cup (in Glasgow).

England finished fifth last year after losing to South Africa in the semi-finals.
