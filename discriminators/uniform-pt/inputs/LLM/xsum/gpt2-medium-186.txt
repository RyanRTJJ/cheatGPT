 £300,000 a year to make a new film about Russian corruption. But the company behind Cushnyahan, Kaspersky Lab, did not sign the licence papers required for it to be allowed to work on the project. That company has gone bust as a result.

Cushnahan was paid £300,000 in total by Kaspersky Lab on its part-privately funded "Sneakers", a film he was supposed to make based on reports linking his firm to Russia's biggest criminal operation, the Stench campaign against Russia's opposition and human-rights protesters. A UK lawyer who represented Cushnaan, Michael Sholem, last year accused Kaspersky Lab of using "straw-man" sleight-of-hand techniques such as fraud and coercion in an attempt to stop him from making the movie.

However, a Kaspersky Lab spokesman claims that Cushnahan did not make the $300million figure in his paid-up-to-date contract with the firm. "Kaspersky Lab had no role in what happened to this film. It was put into production long ago," Peter Thomsen, head of international news for Kaspersky Lab of Cambridge, told the Daily Telegraph this week. "We are in talks with the British Film Commission, and would like to ask them to help us secure the return of this film for publication."


Kremlin officials did not respond to calls for comment.


Cushnahan, who appeared naked in one of the film's promotional footage in 2013, claims that he did not know anything about the hacking and propaganda campaign he was in charge of. "I don't even really know who ran it. I've no clue who was running it. It's just a film, a film about a very serious matter. How could it be controversial?" The film, which is to be shot in the autumn, makes allegations about a Russian secret police operation known as Stench, which targeted groups such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Amnesty International Sweden.


The film's producers, Samir Kassam, a German who appears in the film as a senior Russian official in charge of Stench, and his father, Al-Kasar,
