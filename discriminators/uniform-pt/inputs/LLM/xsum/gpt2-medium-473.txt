 claimed a "ludicrous claim from Facebook".

The trial of Mr Morton, of South Shields, County Down, ended with a verdict of not guilty.

But the case was described as "utterly extraordinary", with barrister Andrew Stroud QC telling jurors that the mobile phone was a "potential crime scene item" and Mr Morton should be sentenced to life imprisonment if convicted.

Mr Murtagh from Northern Ireland said: "The mobile phone is a crime scene item. The defendant may also be sent to prison for eight years as a result of it."

Mr Sullivan added: "This is not about an alleged terrorist plot but about an alleged terrorist attack but in the context of this case it raises a major issue that warrants being raised with him."

Cases of terrorism involving mobile phones have been "coupons placed on my property" in the past and this week, five mobile phones were stolen at Edinburgh airport. The stolen devices, which were found at Heathrow, had all been in lock-up to contain the batteries.

A member of the public spotted a mobile phone in the security screening area of Stansted Airport on 29 September 2014 where a man was stopped over suspicious mobile traffic.

Police were called but no arrests were made.

The following month an officer handed two men who arrived at Edinburgh Airport with stolen cellphones.

As they had a suspicious mobile phone which turned out to be a real mobile they were detained for ten minutes before they realised they had been in there for a terrorist event and were charged.

Mr Sullivan said this was not just his first mobile phone case. "I have cases going on all the time about the phone. People are now saying "It was the phone which was used last time" on the internet.

"All you have is a real or alleged terrorist weapon in the house, the phone has GPS which could tell where the terrorist attack is coming from; it could also tell where to locate [the phone]."
