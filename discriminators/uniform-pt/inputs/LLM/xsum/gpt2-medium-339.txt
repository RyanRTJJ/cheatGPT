 arrested Asghar over a previous police corruption case at the same jail. According to local media, he has pleaded not guilty to charges related to his case at the court in Adiala.

But when the Pakistani media reported that Asghar and others were among the victims of the raid, which began at around 10.30am last Tuesday, the general public reacted with anger online. It soon began to unfold as a tragedy.

Angered by the violence that led to the death of Asghar, social media users made suggestions, sometimes bizarre, at the Pakistan's leading media outlets. In May, they described how Pakistani journalists had to flee the United States, fearing assassination by US intelligence agents, in a tweet that led to the killing of American journalist James Foley. The idea was to expose how US officials and CIA agents are responsible for these killings, and to urge Pakistani officials to respond. However, the notion died down soon after, when social media went down.

There are many suggestions that Pakistani officials or media were involved in carrying out the police-based raid at around this time.

One of the more persistent is that, somehow, Pakistan's interior ministry, in concert with the army, the ISI and the ISI's intelligence arm, which has reportedly also been carrying out the raids, had to set up checkpoints along the road in order to make it even less likely that any of the people on the road will be arrested. Pakistan's police chief, Gen Asim Zafar, himself denied this on Wednesday.

But this argument, however strange and disturbing it may sound, is no longer a possibility. In many cases, police operations in Pakistan, particularly in Pakistan's north, are a carefully choreographed means to intimidate, intimidate and intimidate people.

The way to get people to cooperate at such checkpoints is with a lot of persuasion, coercion and fear.

It has been suggested that police used these tactics to persuade Asghar to join them in the prison. However, no evidence that this actually happened has yet emerged, and
