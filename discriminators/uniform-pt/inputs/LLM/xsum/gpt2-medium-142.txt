At the time of her loss at the hands of Katusha's Emma Johansson, Watson was leading 4Â½ seconds down with 13.5km to go.

The 35-year-old had taken the lead to the line after a hard-earned victory in the final stage of the Giro Rosa which was won by Liviu Schildbach.

Watson said: "It's definitely my fourth Tour Down Under, so it hasn't quite sunk in after the first month.

"It's only about a month longer, and it's only been going good since coming back now. I'm still confident now because I know my chances haven't gone away."

Watson hopes to bounce back with a good performance on the roads of Australia, where she is set to make her Tour debut this weekend.

But she insists that all of her mental and emotional preparation is taken care of by the riders who helped her to victory in Florence by backing her through the sprinters, who are considered the best in the world.

"It's fantastic that they helped me as much as they could, and I want to thank everyone who has helped me in this Tour down under," she added.

"I just wish I could do more after this Tour down under because it's something I really like. It's a very hard road race and you need to get through it as quickly as possible, but that's what I'm getting through in this Tour Down Under.

"I'm still working hard, and you can't put off the race and just do a few more stages, you can't.

"But I'm just working so hard and trying to get that next bonus, like if ever there's that opportunity for me."

There's a good chance she will return to the winning positions she achieved at this year's Tour de Pologne if she can repeat her form in the upcoming four stage race, which will conclude in Pisa on Tuesday.

The British won't be too keen to fight on with Froome and Bradley Wiggins as their supporting riders.

She would prefer to be chasing a stage win at some stage, but Watson will still have to contend
