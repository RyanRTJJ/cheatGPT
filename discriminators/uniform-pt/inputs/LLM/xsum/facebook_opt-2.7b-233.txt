 as many as 120,000 fewer antibiotic prescriptions being filled a year.

The scheme will be piloted in Gloucestershire, Somerset, Staffordshire, Manchester and Leicester and will be rolled out to more than 800 general practices in England in coming weeks.

“We are taking the unprecedented step of trialling an antibiotic prescribing scheme as a direct response to antibiotic resistance,” Richard Murray, chief executive of NHS England, said. “This will cut the over-use of antibiotics among vulnerable groups and give patients and doctors more time to monitor patients’ conditions.”

The scheme has its roots in the National Antimicrobial Action Plan announced in the autumn to help tackle the rising threat of antibiotic resistance.

An additional £1m in funding has been invested to enhance the national surveillance system of resistance with the aim of improving knowledge and capacity to rapidly detect emerging threats and treat patients appropriately.

Dr Dan Lems, deputy medical director of NHS England, said: “Our goal as a country is not to have a crisis – the best thing for society is to save lives quickly and effectively.”

Dr Lems said the scheme was “an opportunity for clinicians around the country to help get the balance right - to develop good prescribing habits, and to improve access to antibiotics – while balancing patient need for treatment with the need to use antibiotics correctly.”

“There is evidence that this prescription scheme could have huge impact, and the pilot we are rolling out this weekend will help to see if it works,” Dr Lems said. “If successful, we will build upon this success with the full national rollout of the scheme next year.”

According to the government’s Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Network, the number of antibiotic prescriptions rose 7% between 2010 and 2014. In 2014, there were 3.8 million prescribing visits to GPs.

Although the scheme was part of a package of measures announced by the government this year, NHS England wants to take a more targeted approach to tackling antibiotic resistance and to drive up awareness among GPs of how new drugs that are clinically appropriate
