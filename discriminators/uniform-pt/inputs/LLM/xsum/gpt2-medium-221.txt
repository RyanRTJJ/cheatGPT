England will face a host of daunting questions in this weekend's games against Holland and France, but if they don't take the first World Cup Qualifying goal they will be under a cloud from the start.

The Scots' lead at 3-0 puts them within touching distance of the Premier League leaders – and they still have a couple of matches remaining against the bottom two teams.

However the England team will be wary, even in this early challenge – and the results would seem to support that view.

In a game of few chances ahead of this weekend's game Scotland have scored just twice in their last 12 matches against countries outside their own group, although those two games were against Wales and Sweden, and the results looked to be even at the end.

As a result, on their return to England they might find some more confidence, but there is also the question of just how difficult England's squad will be tomorrow – and should they have a game plan where they get England as far as they can before they get caught too deep.

The only game they may be in on their own is against the Welsh, though after that they will have better chance of facing the likes of Croatia and Greece because of the amount of matches they have already
