The US, which considers Somalia a failed state, has been carrying out targeted assassinations in Somalia since at least 2006. A decade later, al-Shabab is fighting some of its most ferocious battles in the long years of a US drone campaign that has left at least 2,500 people dead.

In a lengthy interview with the Guardian, the US's top military commander, Gen Joseph Votel, the head of the US Central Intelligence Agency, confirmed that the US drone campaign had killed "senior al-Shabab leaders" who had plotted attacks on American interests in recent years. But such raids were not aimed at the group's leadership but at its members and anyone they could contact, he said.

He did not reveal further details about the operations, adding that he could only discuss the operation against al-Shabab's "infrastructure".

The US military says the raids have killed hundreds of al-Shabab militants, and many of the group's fighters have been killed in airstrikes by the US drone programme. But the operation has also led to allegations of civilian casualties, with at least 50 suspected civilians reportedly killed in attacks.

"We know that senior leaders who are not on the battlefield are on our kill or capture list. We believe they pose an imminent danger to the US and those American interests," said Votel of the drone operations in a wide-ranging Guardian interview.

Votel said the US believed that, since 2011, there had been between 35 and 100 US-led strikes in Somalia. Of those, between 55 and 60 were aimed at al-Shabab, including three in recent months. However, he said the vast majority of the strikes were intended to target al-Shabab's infrastructure: weapons storage, training camps and "operations that were likely to cause maximum civilian casualties".

The US has launched several major drone strikes against al-Shabab in the past and was also seen as responsible for the deaths of hundreds of civilian civilians in
