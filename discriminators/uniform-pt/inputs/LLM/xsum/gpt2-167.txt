 not been charged with the murder and the cause of the accident is in custody.

Police said they do not know what led the pedestrian to hit the car, or why the driver was so seriously injured.

Witnesses described hearing an explosion as the car passed them.

"The scene was chaotic, so we called 911," said police spokesperson Kelly MacKinnon. "There were three people in the car. One was dead as well as a woman suffering from injuries inside. We have not found the vehicle. The male driver has not been charged."

The driver of the bus was released from hospital on $300,000 bail, police said. Another male driver remained at large and is being treated and released back onto the road.

A spokesperson with the Durham Police Service said at first they weren't sure if the accident was actually an accident or the result of the accident.

"We haven't been able to ascertain for sure but we do believe the driver died and that it wasn't caused by the bus or any kind of explosive device," said Sgt. Scott Agana.

Police will continue to contact residents. If you are in Durham or you need assistance at this time, contact the Durham police mobile phone line at 1-877-461-1220.
