320 hit an electrical equipment box and stopped on takeoff on May 1. It was reported that the plane had experienced severe electrical faults, meaning that it couldn't have continued to fly and that it would have landed in the sea off Egypt or the southern Mediterranean, the board said. According to the report published on May 8, its electrical system failed during landing.

According to the reports, the passenger crew were warned and instructed to change into their emergency suits.

Egyptian news reports say the Airbus H320 arrived at its final stop at Cairo's airport after a long trip to Los Angeles and New York. The flight's destination for the afternoon flight, Dubai, would have been Dubai's first stop after that. All passengers boarded the plane with one checked bag; six of them had the proper baggage tags, while the airline sent the others off-world in their own luggage.

The report by Airbus said that the problem only affected the cabin back and front seats of the plane.

The FAA does not expect the Airbus to receive a final report.

As many as 40 people are dead after a plane crashed on the Red Sea island of Reunion in September 2013 killing all 162 people aboard. The Russian airline Metrojet Flight 9268 crashed on Christmas Day in the Sinai Peninsula in a fiery crash that became the deadliest terrorist incident of the year.
