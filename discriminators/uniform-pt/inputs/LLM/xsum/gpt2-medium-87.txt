 Hauran after taking off for the Hajj. The British journalists reported that the driver approached the plane and stopped at the crossing which they saw people being led by the army towards the air-raid shelter but stopped before they reached it. The journalists heard shouting and heard screams in Arabic at the scene.

When they approached the military shelter they saw that it had been occupied by more than a thousand women and children by their commanders. The woman soldiers brought the others into the tent and women from Hina, who had been standing in queue to leave Hauran, were carried into the tent. The woman soldiers then separated the girls and ordered the women to be taken to the army field hospital. Among the wounded were two pregnant women, one of whom was one of the three female journalists with BBC Hausa covering the incident. The other two pregnant women had suffered serious injuries. Their names have been withheld as the families had requested that their contact details be hidden from their families. The families were allowed immediate burial at a local graveyard.

In its statement on 26 February, the BBC Hausa expressed shock and expressed deep sorrow at the "shocking act of terror".

One of the journalists who witnessed this event described how as the plane was landing at Tanjung Pyaay in Mina, four or five men, armed with a rifle who had opened fire on passengers. The bullets were shot into air in a large crowd gathered by the window.

The other two were arrested as they managed to grab their bags from the landing area, however they were detained by security forces and driven in the back of a pickup truck. They were interrogated for several hours for reasons unknown, but police are said to have released the pair just before the next day's flight with some sort of guarantee that they would not be taken to court. There are reports of their wives having been released at the time of this writing. All four have reportedly received hospital stays as a result of their injuries. One journalist has been discharged and
