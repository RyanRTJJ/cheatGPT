However, he argues that an in-school dentist could be more effective in reaching more pupils and increasing oral health.

He said: "At a time when taking preventive action against bad lifestyles is more important than ever, we should use every opportunity open to us to promote better oral health among young people in schools.

"That's why we want to roll out in-school oral health services to even more NHS hospitals, with the aim of improving access to care and preventing future problems taking root.

"This could allow us to warn young people of the dangers of sugar, ensure they brush properly and spot issues early."

The pilot villages of North West London NHS hospitals, working with dental teams, will look into introducing in-school dentists over the next year.

The idea of having an in-school dentist has been backed by a number of Oral Health England, with the charity's chief executive, Sarah Baverstock, saying: "Oral health is a serious issue and we need to be giving our children the best start possible and give them the tools to look after their oral health into adulthood."

The move is also supported by Public Health England, which has said it is important to make sure children have access to dental care, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
