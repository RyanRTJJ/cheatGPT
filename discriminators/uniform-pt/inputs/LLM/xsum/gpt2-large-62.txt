 young boys were raped and murdered at the school.

The boy's mother, Mardi Dunbar, was an assistant secretary to one of the main Labour party parliamentary groups, and is believed to have spoken at meetings of the Unite union on behalf of the victims' families of the abuse.

The Green Spring Academy website also reveals a number of "educational" activities conducted by the school. For example, students are taught about the "true spirit of a gentleman", the origins of "traditions" and the importance of "learning from one another, not just by words but by deeds".
