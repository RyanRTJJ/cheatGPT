 the polls and beset with a series of leadership challenges, Abbott has turned to a tried and true method in his attempt to shore up his image, attacking his enemies.

He called the Australian Labour leader Bill Shorten "unbelievable, unbelievable," which is a good way of saying he can't believe Shorten is still a contender for the Labor leadership, as the comments indicate he has still not yet come to terms with Shorten's success in the recent federal election.

Abbott made his comment on Wednesday during a speech to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Melbourne, Australia.

Tony Abbott's comments caused a wave of mockery on social media.

A spokeswoman for Abbott said: "These were private remarks made during an open meeting of business leaders and MPs."

"It's clear Bill Shorten won the election... These comments did not reflect the views of the Prime Minister, who regards Mr Shorten as a person of great integrity with a strong record of service to this nation," she said.

Shorten responded to Abbott's remarks in a tweet: "Tony Abbott's comments about me and my character today are just the thin end of the wedge."

But Abbott also went after former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, suggesting she would be better at her job if she weren't pregnant.

"To answer my critics... the Prime Minister could not have handled that pregnancy with the same skill as I could have, she would probably be a bit better off to start with," Abbott said.

He has also compared the Labor Party to the Nazis. "Now if you think that's harsh, you haven't seen it said by the Prime Minister, not once, in this period in the Parliament.

Abbott won't stand as Labor's leader before the next federal election, which is due out sometime in 2016. The Liberal Party will elect a new leader during a weekend partyroom meeting.
