 that, the Welsh people - not even for him.

As this latest report on the Brexit vote from The Local suggests, Davies - who is also the son of a Scottish politician - is the only member of his constituency to back Britain leaving the EU. As a Welshman, he had no choice. Even some of his close friends, who still like him and believe in his views, wouldn't take him on.

"I would, if I could, vote Leave, but I wouldn't," he said on Sky's Good Morning Wales programme Friday evening.

A senior member of the Welsh government, he has already publicly spoken out against Brexit, calling the referendum itself a "disgrace".

But when we asked him whether the EU is a very big threat to Wales' future he responded: "Not really. But yes the EU is a threat in my opinion."

The first question to see at the end of June's EU referendum was when Wales would be the next seat of UK government (it's now the sixth) in the UK. Here he is responding, and we've put a video of the interview along with his answer below, embedded below:

At press time, you can see a photo gallery of some of the prominent people - ex-Labour minister Chris Grayling, former minister David Laws, ex-Tory councillor Nicky Morgan, ex-Welsh Conservative party chairwoman Cara Gill and even a picture of another member of the ex-Wales cabinet who was against Brexit - including ex-Cabinet Minister and ex-Labour MP Mark Harper.

I wonder, then, will he back the EU referendum campaign on the basis that he's not sure he's voting to stay in?

That's a question for another day, but in terms of a UK-EU vote, even if he wants Leave - a vote the Welsh electorate are perfectly happy to take - he has to decide if he's really pro or anti membership.
