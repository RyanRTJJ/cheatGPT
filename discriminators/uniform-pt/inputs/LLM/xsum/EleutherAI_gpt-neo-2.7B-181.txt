As America's biggest media company, Gawker has been a leading contender for $250m of the $550m that will be raised for Gawker Media’s bankruptcy estate via private placement. It would more than repay the government’s $100m in aid to the company, which has been operating for just over a year.

Gawker’s creditors and creditors in other media companies including CBS, Paramount and Viacom, have agreed to settle to the $550m – without interest.

The company owes the government $110m, while it itself is facing a possible $25m charge. It must repay the government in full in December, and must also pay about $600,000 a month to its lawyers who have been sued in the last decade.

An email went out after the story was published, asking for more information on how the company got $150m in fees from the Obama administration. It added: “They will be required to provide documentation of any reimbursements that may be due to this department.”

The email has not been returned.

Gawker’s creditors are not obliged to disclose all of their debts, or where they stand on settlements, but the company has paid the $110m that it owes the government.

Gawker and other media companies have been targeted by the Obama administration, in the last few years, as well. They were called to pay $11.7m in back taxes in a case heard by the judge-alone Supreme Court, in the 2010 Citizens United case. And they were penalised by the IRS with a $550m penalty last March, for their role in the online publication of a government list exposing the deaths of abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, and his “pimp”, Andrew Miller.

But, just yesterday, the President said Gawker was “getting away with murder”, by publishing an article that gave details of the government’s warrantless-wiretap plan.
