 on board, including six Australians.

"The area they are searching is the area shown on the map, about 5,500 kilometres (nearly 3,400 miles) off the west coast of Australia," Mr Angus told reporters on board a Japanese aircraft carrier that was shadowing MH370 in the search zone.

'No reasonable alternative'

Malaysia's chief investigator, Detective-Inspector-General Azhar Bari bin Ajid said his team had been able to confirm a new location of the plane with "a reasonable degree of certainty".

However, the Malaysian transport minister rejected any suggestion that the new location was "absolutely definitive". "I am not going to say that we know exactly where it is," said Liow.

"But we can narrow it down to a particular region of the ocean."

The head of the search operation, the retired air force lieutenant-general Danauh Sugiran, said last year on the same aircraft carrier that it was "highly speculative" to suggest there might be a wreckage at such a large distance from the plane's last location.

"If it turns up nothing... we don't even have any reasonable alternative explanation," he said. "We've just come to one conclusion. The plane has probably crashed in the southern Indian Ocean."

Boeing has so far provided more than 50,000 hours of search plane assistance since the plane disappeared in March.

But there have been claims that Boeing and the Australians have been slow to share data on possible MH370 debris on the ocean floor, some of which may be crucial to a long-time puzzle over the plane's disappearance.

In the media conference, Australia's chief-of-national-security-defence, Angus Houston, did not address the criticism from the Boeing and Malaysian authorities, saying the plane's disappearance remained "a tragic and complex mystery".

The search for the missing flight, which was being coordinated by the US-based Boeing, had been scaled back to focus on the southern Indian Ocean.

But he said: "While in the vast open ocean, at this point, sadly, we do not have any credible new information, other than one possible signal, that could be MH370".
