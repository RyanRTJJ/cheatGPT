 believes in targeting problems not the individuals.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: "We provide an active frontline policing service to help address criminal and antisocial behaviour, but we recognise that there is room for improvement. Our focus is on improving behaviour by using a range of resources, including the police, community partners, community groups and offenders services. Efforts will shift to this through the development of new tools, techniques and training within local communities."

The Home Office, which took over the work from the Police Services Board in June 2015, has also said its approach would be different to the current model.

It said in December police would:

- Ensure that antisocial behaviour is identified and dealt with effectively.

- Work with local communities, working with faith groups and other key stakeholders to ensure people realise that 'this is wrong'.

A Home Office spokesman said: "In the first half of this year we have already made good progress in tackling antisocial behaviour, working with local communities and police colleagues to create a sense of cohesion to tackle this. We will continue to work closely with communities and partners on how best to work together as we approach 2016. "We will continue to ensure we develop new tools and information to help offenders tackle these issues effectively."

The Metropolitan Police Federation also criticised the force for not making tougher anti-spam laws, arguing that such regulations had the potential to be applied to an increasingly complex and "ambiguous" internet data environment.

The MPS said: "Although the police and police partners all have a role to play in the implementation of anti-abuse and anti-spam legislation, the impact of these decisions can only be assessed through live enforcement actions from individual officers. The Home Office has recently asked for further guidance which would ensure that there is no impact to victims or the wider community and that only sensitive matters are dealt with by law."

The Association of Chief Police Officers welcomed the Home Office's "important role". Police figures in its annual conference in London said the number of antisocial behaviour alerts was falling rapidly despite strong performance by some units.
