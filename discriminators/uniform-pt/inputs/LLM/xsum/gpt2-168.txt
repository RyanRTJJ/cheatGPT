 ensure he becomes the man his country need rather than being turned away. A statement from Fifa says, "(Jurist) Pinto believes there was no clear evidence for a link between the European qualifying and their visit." Fifa will announce the latest news when it comes to the possible inclusion of the Portuguese forward in the 2016 Euro 2016 squad.

The news comes as FIFA president Sepp Blatter's government has set up a committee to investigate the allegations raised with former FIFA executive Michel Platini. There are plans to invite Fifa's ethics committee to investigate the matter and to meet with the former Fifa president himself. Blatter's predecessor, Sepp Blatter, would then have seen fit to make a public statement condemning the allegations. Although none of the allegations have been proven concretely, Fifa would need at least a dozen people to look into the matter.

On Tuesday morning, Blatter himself told a press conference that he was sorry that Platini had been dismissed. "This was certainly an inappropriate decision in an official capacity," Blatter announced. "It would have been better if I told a similar story."

Tottenham's Pochettino has already spoken privately over the matter of Blatter's resignation. At this point, Blatter is understood to be well aware that the US Soccer Federation has rejected suggestions that his name was used to represent one of the top US men.

Spurs have also been in touch with the Spanish government, which says it is "very concerned by the statement of the President" and wants him to come to Washington to meet with Blatter personally.

Blatter said, "I am happy and proud to have been part of the team that has been important, particularly this year when my representatives are all very keen to bring more players to Tottenham". That remark was followed on Monday by an early statement from Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy to reporters from Fifa's executive committee
