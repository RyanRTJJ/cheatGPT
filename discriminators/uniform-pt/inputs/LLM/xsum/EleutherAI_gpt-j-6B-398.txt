“This is part of a package of measures being taken by Tata to increase their contribution to the local economy following the announcement of a further reduction in plant production from 2015 onwards,” said a company spokesman. “It is in line with our overall strategy to be in a best-in-class position in this sector to maximise the profitability of the business.”

Tata’s announcement included a £70m investment in its North Lincolnshire site and the creation of 600 apprenticeships in engineering, technology and management, and up to 400 jobs to be created. The jobs will pay at least the equivalent of the current UK Living Wage, with any overtime also paying the Living Wage.

The company says the move is an essential part of its new global steel-making strategy, launched in September, which has involved the closure of several of its plants in the US. That includes facilities in Coronet, California, and Lone Eagle, Iowa.

Tata, which has a workforce of about 13,500 in the UK, has also announced an investment of just over £8m to create more than 500 new engineering and management apprenticeships.

However, a consultation on the move from those with the Community Links union earlier this month, was described by a Tata spokeswoman as “largely unsuccessful”. She added that “there have been a number of occasions where the potential workforce have requested extra time to respond to the consultation, and unfortunately the only option is to proceed with an orderly closure plan”.

Tata’s decision to shed 900 jobs will see 1,200 workers face redundancy in the coming months.

Middlesbrough council leader Keith Wakefield described the cuts as “deeply regrettable and hard to accept”. But he defended the council’s economic strategy amid talk of a £100m raid on the city’s coffers.

According to a report on the Evening Gazette website, Mr Wakefield made the comments at an emergency meeting of councillors to address the council’s “financial crisis”. Earlier in the day, Mr
