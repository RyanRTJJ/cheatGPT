, the deputy mayor of Glasgow which was heavily hit by the 2010 floods, plans to hold a press conference at 10am.

The annual festival takes place over three days in May.

Festival director George Kirkby says: "Glasgow's Hogmanay has gone on for almost 150 years and we've enjoyed a unique and unique relationship with its people. It represents a day when we all celebrate the spirit rather than the weather."

Sally Cocks, from Glasgow City Council, said: "We are delighted that the Government has agreed to open the ground floor for this year's Edinburgh Hogmanay. To our great chagrin, only four of the 42 buildings around us on the grounds currently remain closed."

But Glasgow City Council deputy chair, Neil Smith said: "I am deeply disappointed with the failure to provide for the needs of the public. They should have been assured that this year's event will be free and open to the public, and we've been given no reassurance over that."

Mr Smith also criticised the delay of making the ground floor open to the public, saying: "It's shocking that a Government that is committed to helping this great city take control of its own future should feel the need to delay this very important event for nearly 150 years until after the Brexit process has concluded.

"The delay isn't about protecting businesses that are competing in the new global economy. It's about the city's future at risk.

"I would say that this Government is going to be judged in this by the country's future, but it may be our future that comes first. We've been promised the best event in Glasgow – and it cannot happen if the event is just not run to what is best for the citizens."

It follows other recent events across the UK – notably at St Andrew's Park in Glasgow – that were held by Glasgow's own people and allowed events and individuals to decide which buildings were suitable
