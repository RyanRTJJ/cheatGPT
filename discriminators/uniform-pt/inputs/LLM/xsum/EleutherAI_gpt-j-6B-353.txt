 said he was not sure about the principle behind the idea.

"I don't know about the principle itself - it depends on how long it takes, obviously," he said. "I was told when I was in the opposition that salaries should stop after a certain amount of time so people should have to take a cut in their own standards. I think there will have to be some kind of deal - if not this deal then the next."

Mr Adams is due to meet the DUP leader, Peter Robinson, at noon today to try to reach a deal.

Mr Paterson, who is expected to step down as NI secretary, said he did not believe a compromise on Mr Adams' terms could be achieved.

"If it's a big enough disagreement, it isn't going to be resolved, but if it's a relatively minor disagreement, in which people in politics can't resolve it in private, they have to be resolved in public," he said.

"I wouldn't expect a resolution of that disagreement in the next couple of hours today - I would be very surprised if a resolution was reached.

"There are only so many hours in the working day, and obviously there's other things that have to get done."

Earlier, DUP leader Peter Robinson insisted he was still focused on the agreement process.

"I don't think it should influence at the moment my relationship with the SDLP," he said. "The talks aren't over - we have been engaged with Sinn Fein's team and they are continuing to respond to our responses."

The DUP leader added: "In the interests of the people of Northern Ireland, we must ensure those negotiations go ahead. The DUP has made significant changes at Stormont and we need to consider that."

However at Stormont, there are said to be a number of opposition parties who will boycott a key meeting of the Executive on Tuesday evening as the process has appeared to be "stalled".

SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell said he expects to be excluded
