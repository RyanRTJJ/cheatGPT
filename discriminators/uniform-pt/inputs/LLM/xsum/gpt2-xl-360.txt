A forensic examination of a drive found a series of numbers in a short message. There are 12 of those numbers repeated in the text of the message. Some of those numbers are not only repeated but are also written in a certain order.

The messages were all found on Stephen Bell's computer at the time the child abuse images had been found.

One of those messages was found in the image of a computer disk labeled "2b." The drive contained several images of children being abused.

After Stephen Bell was charged with making and distributing child pornography, detectives from the computer crime group conducted further investigations.

Through a process known as back-up analysis, they were able to reconstruct what those numbers were doing on Bell's computer.

The detective then spoke to Bell directly about the messages they had found in his hard drive. The messages were used as proof that Bell had committed a crime.

Criminal lawyer Julian Edwards told his client that they were "a damning piece of evidence."

"You cannot just leave those messages behind. You cannot simply make a statement and say, 'No I did not do that." said Edwards, who is no relation to the defendant.

In sentencing Stephen Bell, Judge Thomas Auld said it should be "careful that somebody else doesn't find them and make the same mistakes he has made."

In a separate case, Ross County Sheriff's Deputies made an arrest in connection with a child sex tourism operation.

In that case, a deputy was monitoring a Skype session that the suspects in that case were having, and saw two men talking together. The two men were from England and they were discussing how to travel to the United States to purchase children.

That deputy had received a tip that an underage girl was being taken around the country by the men and sold as a sex slave.

Detectives from that unit arrested 20-year-old Ryan David Lister on the street on January
