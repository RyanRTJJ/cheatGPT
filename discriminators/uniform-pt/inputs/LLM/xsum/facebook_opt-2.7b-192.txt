 could be taken back to Australia.

About 1,200 people are thought to have been aboard the boat when it set out from Indonesia on Tuesday but Indonesian police put the estimate at 890.

"Police are still combing through the bodies of the victims and conducting DNA tests to identify them," said national police spokesman Argo Yuwono.

Police were alerted about a boat on Lake Toba at the tip of Sumatra, about a 1,200-kilometre drive from West Timor.

"We found the boat carrying about 100 people floating in the water on Lake Toba," said regional deputy national police chief Gatot Eddy. He added that the boat had sunk.

"We're still combing through the bodies of the victims in order to identify them. There were a few who were young men and we're trying to find their families," Gatot told AFP.

Indonesia's immigration and asylum ministry has not commented on the number of passengers or crew, but there have been previous boat accidents in the region.

Earlier this month, about 140 passengers including babies, women and children were rescued from a rubber boat after it capsized near the island of Bangka.

The boat was carrying about 250 people when it left from Tanjung Lesung village and sank 20 minutes after leaving town.

The boat capsized when most passengers and crew had already crossed the Timor Sea.

More than 30 people survived after being picked up by a passing fishing boat. Police said those rescued had no documents and may have been smugglers taking asylum seekers to Australia.

Indonesia's Immigration and Asylum Board spokesman said Australia's offer of assistance would be reviewed "on the basis that the vessel and the survivors' identity and nationality" could be confirmed.

Australia currently holds about 450 asylum seekers who arrived by boat on Christmas Island, off Western Australia in late December. The boat disaster is Australia's first major refugee disaster since the refugee resettlement program began 12 years ago.
