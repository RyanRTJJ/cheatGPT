As it turns out, the break was anything but permanent.

In its statement on Thursday, DF Concerts thanked patrons and festival staff for their support this year.

"We are thrilled to announce that the 2017 edition of the DF Concerts Festival will mark its 10th anniversary," it said.

"The festival is a celebration of the great live music that Auckland has to offer, and an opportunity for the city to experience the breadth, depth and diversity of the global electronic music community."

The lineup for 2017 will be unveiled next week.

DF Concerts also announced a new partnership with international electronic music label, Ministry of Sound, which it says will "support electronic musicians to reach as wide an audience as possible."

The announcement was also accompanied by a teaser featuring the first tracks from Ministry of Sound's "Summer Music Series" for this year, which consists mainly of electro music and is set to take place at the Auckland Town Hall venue in November.

"We're constantly monitoring the world of electronic music to find new artists to promote in New Zealand, and we're delighted to partner with Ministry of Sound to bring electronic music to Auckland Town Hall this Autumn," says Matthew Coad, co-founder of DF Concerts.

"MF DOOM, SADO & THE OX, and DIMETROPES will showcase their talent at MTOS Town Hall across the two-night series and we're sure New Zealanders will be in for some stunning electronic music."

DF Concerts is based in the Spark Arena - the city's brand new indoor event space which opened in September amid high expectations from festival goers. The organisation's other flagship venue, the ASB Dome, has been sold to the Auckland Council for use as a theatre.

The "Summer Music Series" is available for pre-sale, with tickets going on sale to the general public from October 20. For more information, download the latest issue of Aotearoa Electronic Music Report, available from online news outlets (https://www.eargirlz.co.nz/2018/07/04/online-
