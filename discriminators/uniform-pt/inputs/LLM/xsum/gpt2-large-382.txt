 the two permanent seats there used for the General Assembly. Since then, the EU has been using the UN for diplomacy, trade and the promotion of its international organisation. When the UK leaves, it will lose access to this body and the many other international organisations where the EU plays a significant role. But what other options does the UK have of doing business overseas when there are significant disadvantages to doing business? The UK no longer has a veto over all issues that come before the UN Security Council or the European council – or at an EU-level. It may choose to engage in bilateral deals, with the EU or with countries that do not have veto, but there are much more direct avenues for Britain than in the past.

The EU talks of a "re-united Europe" that is the only one that actually exists. Yet a majority of member states are far from being united on many issues. They are divided on matters like the Common Agricultural Policy, which affects Europe's agriculture export markets; EU accession, which affects the continent's agricultural product supply; the single market, which controls trade and investment; and membership of the Schengen Area and Euro-Atlantic organisations (the body of 28 countries that share responsibility for law enforcement around the globe), which together bring together borders and regulations, legal systems and law enforcement practices.
