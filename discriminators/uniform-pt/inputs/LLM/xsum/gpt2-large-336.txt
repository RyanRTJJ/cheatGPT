 target of a 50 percent decline in the number of under-fives in the next 20 years.

"It's more or less a wash," said the report's author, Dr. Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician who is president of the World Health Organization's research programme on under-fives' health.

Over half of the deaths are children under 13, with an estimated 16 million of them dying every year. The research was based on mortality data collected for every year from 1980 to 2011.

The analysis does not include data on preventable deaths such as infection, heart disease or child mortality, which is not recognized by the UN.

"Most experts doubt that reducing under-fives to the number of children and young adults in 1990 can be achieved," Landrigan said.

The under-fives report has long been regarded as the most authoritative measure of childhood mortality statistics to emerge from the UN health agency.

It has raised questions about the accuracy of previous government death certificates, particularly those for the very young, because they lack sufficient safeguards to safeguard children who are still growing during the years of their death.

But critics were quick to question its findings, calling it a "sham" and a "smear campaign."

Raghu Kale, a paediatrician with the Centre for Reproductive health and Development and a visiting fellow at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California said the WHO report "has shown that although the number of deaths among under-fives has declined, their contribution will go up. And that should be alarming. This is going to impact families, communities, education."

The WHO research is controversial, Kale said: "If we are going to stop under-fiftys dying, we should be looking for other ways, and there is a new approach here."

The study looked at 12 countries to compare the relative decrease between 1990 and 2015 with a global picture.

In Mexico, for example, the number of under-fives declined from 3.5 million to 2.5 million between 1990 and 2015, but deaths in Mexico's cities dropped by a smaller amount, from 1.6 million to 1.4 million, the report showed. In contrast, total deaths in
