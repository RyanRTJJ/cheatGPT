Hardman was said to have spent time in jail after being sent to prison in 2011. In 2012 his publicist said he had turned his life around and could now stand up for the right reasons for a criminal record.

Hardman was found dead inside the flat of a man he was living with when he died. The Metropolitan Police officer investigating the death is being kept under close surveillance in the wake of the murder.

Hardman lived in Camberwell, South London, with a young lady of about the same age. He liked reading and making up stories for his younger companions.

His family are understood to have been aware of his problems with drugs.

Police said they had spoken to a 16-year-old male, who had been at the party, before they sent a homicide investigator to the flat and spoke to a friend of the man shortly after the body was discovered. The detective, who said he was not in uniform at the time, said he left the flat, having walked on a path to get there, before the death was confirmed.

A Met police spokeswoman confirmed that a detective had been sent to the flat along with a constable. A postmortem examination would be conducted on Thursday.

Hardman lived in one of four addresses in Ealing, which was home to a large number of children in
