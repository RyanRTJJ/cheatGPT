 already won the first trophy of the Louis van Gaal tenure, the inaugural Community Shield.

Manchester United's Louis van Gaal has been linked to a return to Barcelona.

The Dutchman left the La Liga giants in 2014 after nearly four years in charge.

He was linked to the post at Bayern Munich, but failed to be given the time at the Bundesliga club that he wanted.

Van Gaal's last senior assignment has been United, who have managed to win the Community Shield on penalties.

United were 2-1 winners following a penalty shoot-out after the match ended 0-0 in a hard-fought encounter in a soggy Wembley.

Juan Mata levelled for Arsene Wenger's side after just five minutes of normal time, but substitute Jesse Lingard's equaliser just three minutes before half-time left the game goalless after extra time.

Arsenal suffered from a slow start and they had to rely on two players, Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil, to prevent the game going to penalties early in extra time.

Lingard sealed it for the visitors with a stunning solo goal at the end of the second half of normal and it came to nothing after Sanchez and Ozil both hit the post with shoot-out efforts, only for the former to convert the winning spot-kick.

Van Gaal was handed his first trophy as United manager after former boss Jose Mourinho, whom he guided to a Champions League victory with Bayern in 2013, departed Old Trafford for the Tottenham Hotspur hotseat on 19 July.

He is contracted to the club until the end of 2017, but has an option for an additional year.

Speaking after the match, when asked about the speculation linking him with Barcelona's vacant managerial vacancy, Van Gaal said: "What is speculation?

"What is speculation to me is how to perform the next job."

The United boss also spoke of his desire to extend his contract with the Red Devils, adding: "In football it is important to have a contract and not to have a contract."
