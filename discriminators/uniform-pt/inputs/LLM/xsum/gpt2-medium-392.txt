 of this continent... we recognise that when we put our trust in others, and not in ourselves..."

He talked about how he helped to change the country's attitudes towards climate change because he wanted to help the poor as he did with the military.

"For my own part, I try to be as active in the world as possible and this has been something that the prime minister has done that's really exciting and good for New Zealand... I have been very committed to helping the poorest in the world," he said.

There have been calls for New Zealanders to do things differently from previous decades.

In September 2014, Prime Minister John Key said one of his most famous quotes in front of the world was: "If you think you can do it, don't worry about it; if you think you can't, start."

He was speaking to thousands of participants as part of a global climate summit in Davos, Switzerland, at the time.

The then-Prime Minister promised that the biggest change he could make was the way the Australian federal government was managing its resources.

He said: "The Australian federal government, as part of this massive change we want... I've looked very seriously at the idea of taking back the resources... We haven't even got back down to making back the budget."

Key has come under increasing pressure from climate activists since then after he announced the scrapping of a carbon tax due to roll out in New Zealand in 2020.

Earlier this month, Opposition Leader Bill English said the Australian government could "turn itself into a banana republic just like New Zealand had been".

Key has said the world was better off with low-income and globalisation rather than having low-paid workers on low wages.

But he also said the current government needed to find money to tackle poverty.

New Zealand has less than 2% of New Zealand's GDP but its economy is one of the fastest-growing in the world and it has been one of the world's top growth leaders
