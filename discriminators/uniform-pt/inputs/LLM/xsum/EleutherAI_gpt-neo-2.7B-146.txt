 drivers’ standings

The 2014 Formula 1 season has seen a number of new additions to the Formula One world championship grid at different points of 2016. Mercedes have made their first move, to take Valtteri Bottas out of the Red Bull team as a part of a fresh driver programme. Red Bull have replaced Daniil Kvyat with Max Verstappen, but Red Bull are still on terms with two different Mercedes drivers, with Daniel Ricciardo and Nico Rosberg competing in the drivers’ and team-mates drivers’ championships. They will, of course, fight, however.

The last driver the Red Bull teams acquired with their 2015 F1 title came just before the first race of 2016 and was Kevin Magnussen, of whom Verstappen is not entirely unfamiliar, after he took over the Renault outfit the previous year. Magnussen replaced Sergio Perez, whose move to Renault in 2014 also coincided with Red Bull’s first move to Mercedes.

Rosberg and Hamilton’s rivalry

After Rosberg won the World Championship last year, Hamilton became the Mercedes driver to lead the WDC in 2015 while Rosberg trailed him to the front. When Mercedes came back into F1 two years ago, Hamilton’s title was almost over, but Rosberg finished ahead of him again, with Hamilton finishing third and Rosberg fourth.

This year, though, the story has changed. Hamilton is fighting Rosberg to the death. Rosberg has been struggling as he tries to improve. With his title challenge faltering as it is, he could be in line for an improved season.

Rosberg was the first man out of the Mercedes team, making a new, young team-mate his team-mate. Hamilton, having already won the Drivers’ title, would not have become the first man out of the Mercedes team had he not won the World Championship. He is therefore on course for a title fight with Rosberg that, in my view, could finish the year in the points. Given the fact that Renault had just ended its previous season with the biggest year-on-year growth in the performance of their new car, the title battles they will have to fight this year
