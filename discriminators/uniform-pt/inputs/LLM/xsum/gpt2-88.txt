 continues to bring in enough money for Welsh language instruction.

It does not specify which of the two services in question were already available to Welsh speakers.

A spokesperson for the service said: "There is evidence that Scottish language instruction can be significantly more effective in achieving Scottish language recognition and learning. The aim of S4 is to ensure the access to Welsh language training continues so that Welsh-speaking Scots can gain full participation throughout the educational system."

The report also called on ministers to "get back at the SNP and focus on promoting the needs of Welsh learners."

The Scottish Department said in response to the report: "The Scottish Government is committed to increasing access to Welsh language service provision and to ensuring that Wales-speaking participants benefit from the services that they receive.

"We are encouraging them to get back at the SNP and focus on promoting the needs of Welsh learners."

A spokesman for the SNP said: "Following a review by UK Secretary of State for Scotland Theresa May, Scotland's largest and most respected Welsh language programme, S4 has been fully funded and in place since 2004.

"S4 has been a good partner, supporting and improving the implementation of S4 services across Scotland and in areas including education and culture and language learning."

The Welsh Minister for Education, Michelle Radbourn, said the committee report shows the Government wants to "do something positive for Welsh learners".

Scotland's first minister said her Government will "support S4 by devoting Â£150m more".

Conservative leader Ruth Davidson accused S4 of "trying to hide the truth from people in the UK who care about their Welsh children".

She said: "A report released today by the Culture, Welsh Language and Communications Committee suggests that some funds for S4 have been misappropriated or diverted because the Scottish Government wants to maintain funding."

The Scotland First leader added: "I'm going to hold the Scottish Government accountable for taking this money and using it improperly.
