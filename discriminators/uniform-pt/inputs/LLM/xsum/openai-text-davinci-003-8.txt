 Life Aberdeen, will have about £660bn of assets under administration, making it one of the biggest investment companies in Europe.

The merger brings together two of Scotland’s largest investment companies: Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life plc. The combination of the two companies will result in a larger, more diversified business with a larger asset base, global presence and access to capital.

The combined business will provide customers with leading investment capabilities, advice and technology solutions to help meet their long-term investment needs and objectives.

The new company will benefit from the strengths of both organisations, such as Aberdeen’s deep active asset management capabilities and Standard Life’s experience in helping customers achieve their retirement goals.

The merged business has planned to simplify costs, freeing up capital, which can be reinvested in innovation. This should provide a more scalable, customer focused platform while delivering a strong return on investment.

As part of the merger, Standard Life shareholders will receive 0.757 shares in the combined entity for every existing share in Standard Life, while Aberdeen shareholders will receive 0.7496 shares in the combined entity for each Aberdeen share.

The combined company has set out three key pillars to its strategy: people, customers and returns. It will focus on developing digital tools and technology to serve customers better, and delivering strong returns for shareholders.

The newly created business will target customers who are looking for sound investments, combined with a tailored approach to advice. A key objective of the combined business will be to drive customer satisfaction, while also providing a positive experience for customers when dealing with the Group’s products and services.
