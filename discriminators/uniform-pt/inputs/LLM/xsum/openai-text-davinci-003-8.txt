irmingham have more than twice the national average number of deaths.

This latest revelation is part of a continuing effort by hospitals in Birmingham to make data more publicly available. The idea behind this effort is that increased transparency will help ensure standards of care are maintained, and will encourage continued innovation in surgery.

The initiative is part of a wider programme, known as the Quality Improvement Analytics Hub (QIAH), which was launched in 2016 by Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust. The aim of this hub is to take advantage of big data to identify areas of improvement in the quality of patient care.

The data released by Birmingham's hospitals includes information on a range of outcomes, such as readmission rates, infection rates, wait times, and length of stay. This kind of information is helping hospital consultants identify areas where improvements can be made, as well as areas where they need to focus their efforts to reduce deaths related to surgery.

In addition to publishing this data, the QIAH is also working to collect and analyse patient feedback. This allows hospitals to target areas for improvement and provides a valuable tool for evaluating the performance of their surgeons.

As hospitals in Birmingham continue to focus on data-driven quality improvement, patients across the city benefit. By empowering patients with more information, they are able to make more informed decisions about their care. This in turn, will lead to better health outcomes, reduced complications, and fewer preventable deaths.
