 one third between 2015 and the autumn.

An analysis from consultancy firm Euromonitor earlier this week showed it would have to cut its tariffs to 10 per cent if the new approach to electricity delivery became law, a threat that may be difficult to avoid.

"The government's approach is one that's being seen at three to five per cent cut," said Paul Lewis, the chief executive of EMW, a firm on energy policy, energy and business policy. "It is quite clear that the Liberal Democrats now in power are going to be very aggressive when it comes to that sort of thing.

"We will be on the wrong side. If they stop us selling at 11.50 per cent or 12.25, they're going to push us out of business and you'll see this effect not only in the energy sector but in the other part of the economy."

The move will see EMW's wholesale cost rise by almost 6 per cent, following its 2011 move to sell on to another energy market unit, Vattenfall.

But the government's approach was seen by some analysts as a "deeper" cut in its support for energy delivery than the previous government.

Energy Minister Malcolm Turnbull said "that's not a policy that should come from a government that wants to be opposed to renewables".

Other energy ministers have also sought to improve the efficiency of the grid, and there are concerns about the viability of solar panels that cost up to seven times as much and which have been installed outside the UK as conventional ones.

Asked for more details on what is known as "the black hole effect" from the Liberal Democrats in office, Finance Minister Stephen Conroy said: "With regard to the black hole effect: there's been work undertaken on our policy to create incentives in the energy sector to deliver on their objectives of providing more affordable energy and avoiding higher costs so that, instead of having to use renewables a long, expensive green subsidy is the most viable.

"In Scotland there's a black hole effect, and we're doing what we can to ensure we bring it into that sphere."

Citing work on solar panels in Glasgow and the Northern Lothian region, the government said: "We will be
