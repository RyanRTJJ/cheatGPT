Mrs Turner, a former pupil at nearby Chidleigh Park Primary School, had not been well for some time, but her family was told she had been suffering with a blood clot - a deep vein thrombosis.

A member of the public called 999 and she was airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary.

'Very upset'

A statement on the family's website said Mrs Turner's husband and his sister-in-law were unable to visit her for another couple of weeks.

"They would like to thank all those who have sent messages of condolence and to wish her our very best.

"She was very upset and has been withdrawn and unwilling to make herself available for visitors for several days now. Some may feel that a further stay at Leeds is inevitable and this is regrettable.

"We are doing everything we can to ensure that she can have the rest she needs."

Ms Turner had two daughters and one son before moving to London two years ago and working for the Queen's Household Division for the Army before being made a Dame Commander.

A British Army spokesman said: "We are extremely sad to hear of the death of Mrs Louise Turner. She has served her country for the last 20 years proudly, but today is a very sad day for all of us."

He said the Army would be making a statement in due course.

The Queen has offered to stand in for the Duchess while she is on a goodwill tour of Afghanistan and Scotland in early May.

In April, the Duchess of Cornwall, the daughter of Prince Charles and aunt to the Queen, died aged 86.

In April, William said: "One of the greatest burdens that our royal families must bear is that of a father's love for a daughter. I will be eternally grateful if your kind attention can so easily enable her mother to experience a few months' peace, and of course you will all carry her in
