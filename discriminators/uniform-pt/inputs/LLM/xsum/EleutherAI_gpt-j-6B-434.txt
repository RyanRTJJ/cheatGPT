 made the search for the pair and the rest of the British team difficult.

The other athletes have now returned to the city, where the women’s team manager, Liz Boulton, hopes they might have been spotted.

Two British athletes on the first women’s ski race in the history of the Paralympic Games could still be missing, authorities have announced. The men’s and women’s downhill races take place from Tuesday to Thursday.

The 27-year-old and 24-year-old, who represented Britain in Sochi two years ago, failed to return from a ski outing on Friday of last week.

"We don't know their whereabouts or how to contact them. They were last seen on Wednesday afternoon," said Benoit Trochu, an international committee member.

An avalanche could be the cause. Bad weather and risk of avalanches have hampered search efforts.

"The mountain is closed at the moment because of the danger of avalanche," he added.

The men's and women's teams are made up of athletes who use wheelchairs, due to conditions like rickets.

The athletes, from Bradford in northernEngland, finished fifth and 17th at the Sochi Games last year. Both had taken part in trials ahead of the Sochi Games.

One, a woman who competes using a ski in her legs, was injured in training and could not compete.

Team GB won 10 medals, finishing fourth in the event, which was the same number they won in Sochi.

The other British athlete who competes in this year's Games has already flown home, after her brother and mother died just hours apart on a flight from the US.

Sitting on a train in Tokyo with her family, Chloe Campbell said her brother Nick, her mother Mary and her uncle had died in a plane crash on Saturday. "They died peacefully and that's what made it the most peaceful, especially for Chloe."

The 15-year-old's grieving family have returned home and she is travelling to the Paralympics in the Japanese capital.

It is the first time a Paralympic Games has happened in Asia.

Chloe is competing in two events this year
