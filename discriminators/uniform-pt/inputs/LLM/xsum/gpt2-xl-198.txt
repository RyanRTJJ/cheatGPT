We believe Iran must be able to prove its right and its need for those talks, otherwise I won't allow it to continue as an ally in the region."

US and European officials say this mechanism, called the Joint Commission, could allow any country to report suspicious activity and demand Iran produce evidence that it was not in breach of the
