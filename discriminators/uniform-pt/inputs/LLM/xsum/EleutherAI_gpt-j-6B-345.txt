 been reported in New Mexico.

The FBI offered a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to the arrest of "the subject or subjects capable of perpetrating the horrible act," said FBI agent Jason Packer.

The prison in question is in the northern part of the state in Lincoln County, near the Utah border.

A few hours after his escape, the inmate, 29-year-old Richard Elwood Corbett Jr., was caught by officers in a nearby town, the US Bureau of Prisons told AFP.

The escape marked the third in Nebraska since 2010, and the seventh since 1996, according to figures cited by the Associated Press.

As a result of the escape, Nebraska's maximum security prison is closed for review.

An official at the Nebraska Department of Corrections told AFP that "the inmate is not likely to attempt to re-enter the community."

According to officials, the convict was locked in his cell for recreation on the evening of the escape.

The inmate was last checked on his security level system at 6:20 am CDT (21:20 GMT), with his next scheduled check at 8 am CDT (23:00 GMT), according to the department's website.

It was not immediately known whether Corbett escaped through a cell window or crawled through an air vent, AP reports.

According to officials, "the inmate is not likely to attempt to re-enter the community," and the department said it was working to ensure that any future escapes were prevented.

Nebraska, one of two states that incarcerate death row inmates, has an overall prisoner population of about 10,000.

Most escape attempts in the state result in injury or death for the fugitives and inmates who try to make their getaways.

Nebraska corrections officials have not yet commented on the case.
