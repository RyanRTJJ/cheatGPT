The Turkish presidency said Mr Davutoglu told the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, and the Foreign Affairs directorate chairman, Fikri Isik, they should resign and hand over to him.

Mr Cavusoglu and Mr Isik resigned in protest at the attempted coup - which has killed over 240 people, many shot in the head or neck.

Mr Erdogan has since said those who helped put down the attempted coup will be "stared down and purged".

However, some of those who have worked closely with the president in the fight against Fethullah Gulen and the coup plotters said they would be honoured to get his "thank you" letter.

They include Osman Nuri Gundes, who was Mr Gulen's bodyguard at the time, and is now ambassador to Russia.

"Mr Erdogan personally gave us a clear order, he said, 'Osman, thank you for your commitment and loyalty to us'," said an ambassador with knowledge of the situation.

Mr Erdogan has faced a firestorm of criticism from opponents over the number of people rounded up in the post-coup crackdown.

It is believed there have been at least 7,000 arrests in the crackdown, with more than a third being police or army officers who were involved in the overthrow.

Mr Gulen denies any link to the coup and his followers in Turkey are accused of using their religious influence to manipulate the system.

Mr Isik is a former ally in the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and a former head of military intelligence.

Mr Cavusoglu is a conservative politician with strong ties to the party.

There have been rumours for weeks that he would step in to take charge at the foreign ministry, which has been embroiled in a crisis with Russia after Moscow imposed sanctions against Turkish gold and copper mining companies.

This claim has now been confirmed.

But the Turkish foreign minister told news agency AFP: "No one has submitted their resignation, no one has been dismissed."

Turkish opposition leaders have warned that
