 of the object and determine whether it was the wreck of the Titanic, the largest ocean liner in history that went down during its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912. The pictures the unmanned submarine captured are a bit hard to make out, but here are some interesting details.

First, a bit about the Titanic: the Titanic was one of the largest ocean liners in the world. It could accommodate between a third and half of all passengers in the world by capacity. The Titanic's maiden voyage cost $2.4 million and was a test run for how ocean liners would operate in the post-WWII era. Unfortunately, the Titanic was struck by a iceberg and sunk in one minute, at the start of its maiden voyage, while trying to cross from Newfoundland to Newfoundland's west coast.

And here is some preliminary data, courtesy of CNN: the Titanic was 2,225 feet (688 meters) long, and it is believed that it was constructed of solid iron, steel and concrete; the Titanic was constructed by White Star Line, and it measured about 1,500 feet (459 meters) at its widest point. The Titanic's keel was laid in 1905 in Sunderland, England, and the ship was launched in April 1911, shortly before its maiden voyage. When the Titanic departed Southampton, England and sailed to New York on April 10, 1912, there were more than 1,500 passengers and crew aboard and 14 lifeboats.

The Titanic was considered to be classed as an ocean liner; it sailed on such routes as New York - Liverpool, Manchester - Liverpool, Chicago - Southampton, New York to New York, New York to Southampton, and Paris - Southampton and Glasgow. Unfortunately, the Titanic had not been seaworthy, and a warning light was installed as a warning that something was wrong with the vessel. Apparently, the warning light was not set to operate when the Titanic was actually in danger of sinking, and this allowed the Titanic's engineer who was asleep that night, Jack Dickson, to climb into the lifeboat and go to sleep instead.

The Titanic was carrying 2,223 lives (one might infer from this that the ship would have a very large capacity). The survivors were saved by
