 a rise of 4pc on the previous record breaking day of June, when over 1.2m records were sold.

Record stores now have a bigger presence across Britain than ever before.

Over the July 1st weekend, sales in all music formats were up 9pc on last year, meaning the vinyl sector accounted for a higher proportion of all sales than any other form of music.

In total, there were more than 2.8 million people with a vinyl record and the number of new releases on vinyl are up nearly 10pc, ERA said.

But while vinyl is gaining ground, it is still not replacing CDs as the most popular format. "The record industry should be focused on what's happening with downloads and CDs rather than vinyl," said music publisher L'Argent.

"For every new download, there are five more albums with no physical purchase," said L'Argent's music licensing editor James Lewis. "This trend may be short term but, frankly, it's unsustainable for the music industry we need to be playing catch-up."

However, the RAI's chief executive, Richard Caringey, said: "From the beginning, vinyl has set the industry on a new and profitable path, with the sector selling more than 1.5m records on the first week. A new record is now an important part of our Christmas shopping season."

The RAI said it plans to "deliver a clear message to the industry" that sales of records need to be viewed more holistically, with both physical CDs and downloads taking a major part of the total.

"To continue to have the number of people buying records growing at 20pc per year is the right strategy for the music industry, it means a growing number of people have never had their music on a record player," ERA chief executive John Felice told The World at One. "It is important that sales take centre stage."

Felice said digital downloads were proving to be a "disruptive" force, with a third of consumers having downloaded music and 45pc saying they would prefer to download a physical CD
