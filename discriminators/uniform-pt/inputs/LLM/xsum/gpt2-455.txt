 money, the council could "nearly always go to state level instead of local level," said an expert in the area.

The new proposals to invest over the next two years are aimed at pushing the spending debate away from local and local council control.

In the interim council finances could be reduced by 1.3pc, it said. The plan to reduce council tax will give the authority more time for planning and funding, it added.

The Chancellor's Office said it was also raising tax on £400m worth of property that currently belongs to private investors.

Bills with the following proposals will be added to the public bill:

£1,000 council tax on all residential property.

£5,000 council tax on all new housebuilding properties.

£10,000 council tax on newly constructed estates.

£20,000 council tax on new industrial properties.

£50,000 council tax on a first home and a small business.

£100,000 council tax on new single, married and assisted property.

The bill also includes new council tax rises for council-owned land and on property to be built at the current rate of 1.9pc.

The plans do not outline what these rises will be.

The Chancellor's Office did not respond to questions.

Mr Hodge made the budget in 2009 and has said that the plans are "not new ideas."

As part of his first budget, Mr Hodge last year said: "What a good day for us is to now hear the story and to put the new measures on the table as well as work to set the plans for 2012.

"In my time I've found that it is far easier to write new measures when planning is underway."

If Labour wins power, this will fall on the same date as the party's European elections in December, but it will not have enough momentum to be a vote of confidence for May.
