 Henry Chen, four years' probation and an order not to participate in any business-related disputes with Chinese pharmaceutical companies for five years.

GSK was also ordered to pay $500,000 to two individuals suffering from severe mental illnesses in connection to the case.

In a statement released Sunday, the U.S. Justice Department said the settlement was the largest ever enforcement action taken against a U.S. pharmaceutical company.

"These resolutions send a strong message to companies everywhere that cheating the system in this way will not be tolerated," said John Sullivan, the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the antitrust division.

The drug executives allegedly paid doctors and health care industry representatives for their promotional activities including prescribing doctors for their drug for off-label uses, helping to promote drugs to colleagues, and promoting these drugs. In addition to the government penalties, the two individuals agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.

Investigators began looking into the allegations in 2011. At the height of the investigation, GSK executives met with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in Hong Kong and pleaded guilty in 2013 to charges including accepting bribes and concealing bribes.

While it's legal drug companies do sometimes pay for patients to attend conferences, this was a specific case involving a specific organization.

"This is the highest-level drug company and it was doing something that was illegal," said Joseph Guzm√°n, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.

As part of the deal, Chen agreed not to participate in the affairs of GSK and any other company involved in the matter during the sentence of the two individuals who agreed to plead guilty.
