 called up from the reserves to play in the Championship battle final.

Hockey has said the move is motivated by a desire to get back from "a tough-to-reach stage where some key fixtures are out of reach".

Injury reports have linked manager Nigel Pearson with an indefinite stay on his contract and he said he had no plans to play again because of a hamstring injury.

But his side are hoping their victory over Bournemouth on Thursday will put a stop to their recent concerns from the bench, while Hearts are aware it is being taken out of the equation.

Pearson, in charge of British football since 2001, was appointed after the end of 2004 to run Hearts back through to the semi-finals.

The club's three-time league title winner has been sent off four times in seven season's two biggest campaigns since.

The club is hoping to start the season with a point against Ipswich at home after beating Brighton over the weekend at the weekend.

A statement released from the club said: "Hitting the bar at home against Ipswich (home) last weekend will mean we have got to do better than we've done at home at the weekend and in a battle against relegation, it isn't fair to say we're out of this fight."

Hops and Arrows coach David Wagner will manage Hearts on the fly on Saturday and he spoke during his post-match press conference.

"I know Hearts will have another challenge," he added.

"We played some great matches the last couple of days, so there is time to go out and prove ourselves again.

"Our goals have been to improve us, and we have just got to start scoring.

"We have some great players coming into the game and we will play better game and hopefully give them more success.

"In the end, it's not something we are focused on. I have to think what works. I will keep calm and focus on the game at all times
