 secure centre for all those affected by mental health and drug issues.


HMP Exeter, now the Metropolitan Police force's prisons service, said the council had made necessary changes to its procedures which allowed for all staff to be trained to perform the roles.


The prison service has already made a £100,000 reduction in staff costs with those currently receiving an electronic monitoring badge saving an average £7,000, thanks to changes to the council's contract for that. The cuts also mean a further £300,000 is expected to be saved over the coming two years if any staff are affected.


The council's latest review of the situation found: "The level of capacity will decline further if staffing levels are not maintained."


"In response to the recommendations, we have undertaken specific action to achieve the best use of their training resources. These are now being implemented rapidly."


The new arrangements for prison services are set to be rolled out in 2016.


Rotherham council added: "The number of young women who take their own lives is down by more than 25,000 children in the last five years. This does not include the thousands of children at risk as result of child abuse, sexual exploitation and grooming.


"We are working with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), and other forces, to implement the changes as well as helping us develop the plans to improve services for women and their children in Rotherham. In the next 12 months we also plan to work with our borough and our local partners."


Last year police were forced to disclose the extent to which they had failed to investigate child sexual abuse cases in Rotherham against the council despite the vast numbers of rape and trafficking cases going unreported.
