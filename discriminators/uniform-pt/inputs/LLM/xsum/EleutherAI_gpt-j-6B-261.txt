Toshiba's American business had warned on Friday of the impact from the continuing scandal and delays in its reactor project.

Last month the firm said it was cancelling a new 1.55 gigawatt reactor in Turkey - the first of more than 5,000 it had planned in Europe and Asia.

It was also seeking support to build the US$22bn (Â£15bn; 19.5bn) Hamaoka project in Japan, which is to use a Russian design licensed by Toshiba.

The collapse in Toshiba's share price on Thursday wiped a quarter of its market capitalisation - it was the worst single day drop in the stock's history.

Its bonds and the yen have been hit this week. The Nikkei fell for a 16th consecutive session to close down 6.7% at 12,105 down to its lowest since mid-January.

In the US on Friday, where Toshiba has a US$4.2bn share in the nuclear power firm Westinghouse, the shares fell nearly 10% amid reports of falling US government support.

Mr Kataoka said on Thursday that Toshiba has also asked the government to extend for six months the tax holiday for foreign-based companies that it was granted last year.

The tax holiday allows some companies to repatriate profits earned offshore at a lower rate than Japanese companies. This means that their profits in Japan cannot be taxed at 40% like local-based firms.

In May the government extended this for three years through March 2015.

The company said it would try to raise $4bn from overseas through bond sales to pay off foreign loans and settle debts by March, and increase the company's cash reserves to almost $1.5bn on top of existing $1.2bn.

Toshiba has also agreed to increase the collateral of foreign creditors to $15bn and said it was hoping to sell more shares in March and early April, raising nearly $3.5bn.

Analysts say that the company may need to sell a larger stake than originally planned to reduce its overseas debt.

On Thursday the US utility firm Brookfield Asset Management said it had acquired 24.83%
