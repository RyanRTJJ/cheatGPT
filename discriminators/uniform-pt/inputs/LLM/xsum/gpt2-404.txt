 6,500 pounds into a sea of foam. Within seconds, three people were detained and the remaining two men were arrested.

A spokeswoman for the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the world's largest maritime trade body, says the group was aware of the order but refused to comment.

But a message was sent to the IMO's global partners, saying it had issued the order while taking "concrete steps". The order was issued through the IMO's Maritime Control Centre "at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)'s request", she said.

'It's very difficult to do something like this', she said in a statement: "The IMO is concerned about the safety of our members and can assist them as best they can and they are encouraged by the actions of all governments and other parties concerned."

A senior IMO official described the order as "shocking".

'No more violence'

A top IMO spokesman insisted the move was not justified and the order was being reviewed. They added that the issue was not about one group, but many countries across the international community.

International Maritime Organization Secretary-General Luba Akbari has warned that the new action is "too much, too fast and without any consideration of how to deal with the consequences of action".

"This latest order is wrong and we are now taking all necessary measures to mitigate the threat and to ensure the security of our members," Akbari said during a visit to Malaysia on Friday.

"We are concerned by the move, which we are taking in order to take the risks we have at the local level to bring about a better outcome.

"We will continue to provide our support when needed to ensure we can mitigate the dangers of action. We can only do that with the guidance of national and regional, regional, international, inter-governmental and international agencies."

IMO spokesman Tom Scully said the actions would strengthen the global approach to maritime security, "including by ensuring that all countries and stakeholders support each other and the principles and guidelines of international law".
