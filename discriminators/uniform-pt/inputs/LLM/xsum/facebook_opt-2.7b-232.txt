 make Swansea successful and the Spaniard confirmed that he is in no rush to get the new manager in place.

"It is always important to enjoy the process. It's not something new to me because I have been very successful as a manager in many clubs," he told BBC Sport.

"I want to create a successful period in the team; to see that we can move forward. We must not forget we're still in the Championship - we must be patient and go step by step."

Swansea have also expressed their reluctance to sell key players with Jordan Ayew, Joe Allen and Ki Sung-yueng under contract for 2014/15.

Guidolin believes the Swans will not be hindered by their transfer window restrictions, particularly with manager Mike Phelan set to join the club.

Mauricio Pochettino has been touted as the ideal candidate to succeed Guidolin but it has been suggested that the Argentine may be unwilling to leave the French Football Federation, something that Guidolin admits is the toughest problem he faces at this stage in the season.

He said: "The manager of Tottenham is a football legend. He has a very interesting profile. I have a fantastic relationship with Huw and he knows that his job is very important.

"He is making decisions without any problem and he does not want to make mistakes. My advice to him will be to manage the club in the best possible way, and to do as best as possible to win the games we are going to play in the next few months."

Swansea secured a 1-0 victory against Brighton in their last Premier League outing but Guidolin says his side still need to improve.

"It was the second time we played Brighton and we must take care of our game. I think we can become a better team and we were not bad," he explained.

Swansea host Fulham on Sunday before facing Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park next Saturday.

"The first game will be important and we must take advantage of playing at home because it is a good opportunity," Guidolin concluded.
