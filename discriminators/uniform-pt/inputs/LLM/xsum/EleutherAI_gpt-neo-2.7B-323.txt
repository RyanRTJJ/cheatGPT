 in 2016 amid worsening security and economic problems in Libya, which is now being used by traffickers to bring migrants to Europe through Europe's busiest sea route. The EU will begin debating possible restrictions on the free travel of Libya's citizens to Europe in September.

"Over the course of 2016 it was very worrying, not only the numbers, but also the security. And that's why it took us until a certain date to really start getting to know what was happening," Mr Alkabbas said.

A new EU border agency, Frontex, launched in August 2018 has said one of its main tasks is reducing the human and financial costs associated with the crisis.

Mr Alkabbas said a key factor in the drop in migrants in 2019 had been the growing solidarity of Europe's countries on the Mediterranean.

"We are starting to talk to different countries, we're talking directly with other European leaders, and even countries that don't have any links with the EU. And that's really changing the mood here," he said.

"This year we're seeing more solidarity than in the past â€” and we're starting to see countries like the UK, which has never been able to talk to Libya ever since its foundation, we're seeing them now beginning to talk to Libyans, and to see for example a Libyan air transport officer arrive at their doors. They're actually starting to say 'we're here, we could use your money' and 'we're willing to help you'. So we're seeing a very different mood and a change of attitude."

Mr Alkabbas said the EU was still on track to reach its goal of making sure no more than 1.5 million migrants, refugees or economic migrants would attempt the crossing from Libya to Europe and that the crisis would be sorted.

Mr Alkabbas said the EU needed to be seen as a force for good and should stop being seen as an "institution that's out to get money for itself".
