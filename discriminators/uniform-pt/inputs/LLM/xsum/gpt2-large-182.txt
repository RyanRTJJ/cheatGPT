 Jonathan Sexton and New Zealand's Andy Ellis played in the tournament after being chosen by Sexton's New Zealand Sevens team.

In 2016-17 Ireland will also play a test match to determine who will represent Scotland in the Women's Sevens Championship starting in March 2019.

The RFU says this year's tournament will feature the best 10 nations competing for the right to represent Scotland in the 2019 World Rugby Women's Sevens Series but admits the qualification process is still being finalised.

However, the RFU says the tournament could be expanded to include teams from Ireland.

It says Ireland currently play only one team from outside the country with the RFU having been aware of the potential interest from the U.K and Wales.

England captain John Hardie and Scotland's Chris Cusiter were named as finalists for the men's sevens title last year while Ireland's Jonny Wilkinson, Peter Sorensen, Stephen Moore and John Muldoon were also in contention.

Ireland's men's women's championship went down to the final stage in 2014 where Germany was the only team outside Ireland to beat them to qualify for the tournament but they were the only team to lose out to Northern Ireland and Wales as the rest of the nations advanced.

As part of the Six Nations tournament Scotland is hoping to qualify following the success of their Women's Sevens Championship and will continue to test Scotland's strength.

The RFU says any attempt to field a team from Ireland will need to be considered by senior management to avoid further complicating this process.

Speaking to The42, Stuart Hogg, the RFU's head of competitive rugby, said:

"We need to assess the interest of all involved and if it is a legitimate idea, if it is the right fit then the RFU will look at it but to put that to the RFU board of governors, I don't think there was a vote of confidence this week at some level.

"The RFU will have to be comfortable with all parties involved before we can do anything."
