 to the US and Canada; a recent US ban on laptops on planes to the EU followed last year from the same EU countries.

Mr Laborde said: "This ban is unjustified given that it is impossible to carry a laptop on board a plane.

"For months now, we have been discussing this matter with several other countries, particularly those that have refused to sign onto the agreement."

Airlines have said they were not sure how long the ban would last, but had already made plans to avoid flying to the US, including flying to different destinations.

European airports and bus companies have complained that the threat of a travel ban was causing them to cut services.

Airlines said that it was not possible to know yet what impact the threat of a EU ban would have on its operating costs.

Travellers will be able to buy and take on board a "smart-boarding card" that allows them to bypass security checks.

On average two million people travel to the US each year.

In his keynote address at this year's ICA, Ms Sarkozy said she planned to close some EU countries' "borders".

They include Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg.

But she did not give a specific date.

At the same event in September, Ms Sarkozy said: "The EU wants to bring its borders closer together, to avoid the situation of a country having to decide to close its borders and then finding itself obliged to open them again.

"The common position, approved by a unanimous vote in the European Parliament, makes it perfectly clear that France does not want to close its borders again.

"When we open these borders we will be opening them for business, for tourism, for the citizens of France. But if we have to close our borders we should close them for the sake of security."
