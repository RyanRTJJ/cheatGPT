 they weren't extremists and that radicalisation wasn't their driving motivation because they were bored at home.

Ms Cooper told them: "I do not think this was an attempt to turn the United Kingdom into an Islamic state. They have been led by people who do not belong to the Ummah (community), who have in some cases even used extreme religious propaganda to get you to join.

Judge Peter Davies, who sentenced the trio said he was "horrified" by their actions. "They deliberately took the lives of two young men. This was for financial gain, not because of religious reasons," he said. "It was greed that drove them to this act."

All three defendants were jailed in August for a total of 25 years.

The trio, who were jailed at Liverpool Crown Court, will lose their citizenship. The government said they would also be stripped of their British passports and prevented from entering the UK.

The boys, who all belonged to families of Pakistani heritage, were originally sentenced to at least 14 years for their part in the killing of 18-year-old Lee Rigby outside a Woolwich military barracks in southeast London in May 2013.

They and four other men from the same family travelled to Syria together shortly after that, having been radicalised online.

The fifth, Mohammed Aqib Rafiq, 25, admitted in a statement that he had been a member of Isis.

They told a court they wanted to "kill, chop heads off and fight".

As well as the men who were convicted at Kingston Crown Court, four other people - Ahmed Hassan, Khobaib Hussain, Mohammed Karrar and Mustafa G - have been charged with inciting the boys to acts of terrorism and are due to appear in court in January.
