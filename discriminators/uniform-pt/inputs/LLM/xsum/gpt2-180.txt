"Lam is a high-level employee of the printing house or an associate of publishing house China News International, the publisher of a few books. He was in China visiting friends this week because this was the last straw for our work," China Business Daily quoted his lawyer as saying.

In a statement, the office of Hong Kong chief prosecutor Hong Lei said "there is no criminal case" and his office could not confirm reports of his arrest.

"This information is very good and that there is no criminal case. In my opinion the police have failed, since they have not arrested anyone. But all that has been heard is that the operation was carried out for a personal benefit of our country," he said.

The Hong Kong Daily newspaper cited three sources as saying "local sources said that they observed Lam having spent the evening at a hotel on the city's busiest street, where he said he would be getting drunk in a hurry to the police station to give evidence" before going missing.

Lam's wife and three-year-old daughter had left the apartment in their Hong Kong hotel at 11:50 p.m. last Thursday and were being helped by family members. They did not seek shelter in the apartment and fled.
