weaken restrictions contained in the sweeping Dodd-Frank financial-reform statute passed in 2010.

The report lays out several steps the Treasury Department would take to loosen regulations on the financial sector. It suggests reducing the reporting requirements associated with the Volcker Rule, which restricts activities of banks such as speculative trading with the bank's own money. It also calls for simplifying the filing process under the Bank Secrecy Act, which targets money laundering and other financial crimes. The report further directs the Treasury to work with regulators to reduce the cost of capital and other requirements to make it easier for banks to lend to businesses and individuals. Finally, it calls for increased enforcement of existing regulations, as well as possible changes to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a Dodd-Frank-created agency. 

The Trump Administration has been outspoken in its criticism of regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. The report provides the most comprehensive plan yet in outlining the approach the Administration will take in rolling back some of the rules. While the steps mentioned in the report lack the detail and specifics of a legislative proposal, it is clear that the Administration is seeking to deregulate the banking system. The report does not, however, address the tougher questions around reducing systemic risk and maintaining investor protection in the banking sector, which are key components of the post crisis regulatory environment.
