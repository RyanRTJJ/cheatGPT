 extent of the catastrophe to a few days. The incident caused major ecological problems to Sheilvëëër, which has since been declared a nature reserve. The oil slick drifted for several days, but the local area is a world heritage site and is now covered in thousands of nesting seabirds. Greenpeace and WWF attempted to raise awareness of oil pollution through street protests in several countries, but these were quickly defeated by the governments.

History

S.M. Arkley started operations as a cargo-carrying tugboat in 1967. During the same year, the ship made its first major discovery in the Gulf of Mexico. The ship then began a journey into the Arctic, stopping at Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in January 1968.  A successful return visit made in January 1977 was followed by further trips to the Arctic in 1978 and 1982, and a third attempt in 1989.  In 1992, when the ship was chartered to carry cargo for the oil industry, it embarked ten million tons of crude oil on its maiden voyage to the International Space Station (ISS). After carrying out its initial run, the ship was towed in by two tugboats back to its former mooring in the New Jersey basin. Although the ship remained in-service with commercial operations and was not chartered for the Antarctic, she continued to carry out scientific drilling operations in the Arctic Ocean.

In 1995, S.M. Arkley was chartered to carry out oil drilling operations in the Canadian Arctic, but on the first voyage (the one that began in 1977) the vessel was struck near Sheilvëëër by heavy fog and ran aground off the Shetland Isles on 5 January 1993. More than 17,000 birds were killed, but the oil slick was limited to a few days' duration. Greenpeace and WWF attempted to raise awareness of oil pollution through street protests in several countries, but these were quickly defeated by the governments, and in June 1993, the British government threatened to sue Greenpeace. The oil slick drifted for several days, but the local area is now covered in thousands of nesting seabirds. The incident caused major ecological problems to Sheilvëëër, which has since been declared a nature reserve. She
