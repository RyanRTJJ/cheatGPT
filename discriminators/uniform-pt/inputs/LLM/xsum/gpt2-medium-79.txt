A spokesman for UK Cycling said, "We offer our condolences to Alan's family. He is a great rider of all forms who touched so many people. There was no doubt he had a very important role to play in our sport." One of Mr Chard's friends, Matthew Allen, wrote on Facebook: "He was just a brilliant, wonderful man who enjoyed life. RIP Alan. No one really talks and it is still so moving to hear he is gone. I hope we see each other again soon. We love all of you, we loved them all." "When he died the team's thoughts went out to his family... We are truly devastated at his sudden death," said a spokesman for the British Cycling Federation. "This is a terrible time for Britain's cycling in the aftermath of this weekend's tragedy." A statement posted on Mr Chard's website, added: "We can all remember how Alan turned to me and said: 'I need your help'. You have done so much for cycling, you've been brilliant, but most of all you have touched so many more lives. "I have always loved cycling, for a while before I ran the race I thought it was nothing more than work for me and not for my dad.
