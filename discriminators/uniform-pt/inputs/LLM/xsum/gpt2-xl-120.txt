 elected Labour councillors.

The loss of support has been most noticeable among the Labour-run councils with a large number of councillors left in non-legislative roles or lost after voting for the Tories in the last local government elections â€“ as in Southend.

One of this council's lone Labour councillors, Stephen Jones, said he had not been able to take time off from his job. "Now I can only do that if I take a full-time position at a firm," he said.
