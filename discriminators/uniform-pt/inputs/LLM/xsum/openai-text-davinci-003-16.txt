 storage on land with the help of the US Navy and other local environmental organizations. 

Once in international waters, the naval vessel will use a specialized process to safely dispose of the hazardous materials. This involves using high-powered detonators to break down the chemicals into microscopic particles, which will then sink to the ocean floor and evaporate over a period of time. 

The vessel is also utilising safety measures to protect the crew and surrounding environment. Strict protocols are in place to ensure the operation is conducted in a manner that prevents any inadvertent release of the hazardous materials into the atmosphere.

The vessel crew have also been trained in the handling and management of the materials to minimise any risk to themselves and the environment. Additionally, the vessel is fitted with specialised equipment to neutralize any dangerous gases that may be released. 

By safely disposing of the hazardous materials used in the making of mustard gas, VX, and sarin in international waters, this helps to reduce the risk of these weapons falling into the hands of terrorists or other non-state actors who may use them in terrorist or other criminal activities. This is of great importance for the security of the global community.
