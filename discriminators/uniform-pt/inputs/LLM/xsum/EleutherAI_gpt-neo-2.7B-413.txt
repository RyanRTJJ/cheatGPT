 wrongdoing in relation to the case and says his arrest in 2002 was a result of police harassment. Mr Bailey says he was not informed that he had been arrested until later. Mr Bailey says the officers broke the law and did not have any grounds for making the arrest. The claims, made in court today, are the latest turn in a bizarre long-running saga over how the Irish state deals with people it believes are involved in "terrorism".

He says his arrest was illegal, unlawful and malicious for which he should be compensated.
