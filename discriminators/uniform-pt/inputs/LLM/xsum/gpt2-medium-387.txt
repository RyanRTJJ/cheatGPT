On Monday night, MPs from across his parties met to discuss the implications of Prime Minister Theresa May's triggering Article 50 but the Conservative MP Mark Rees-Mogg said he did not consider it the right time to take action.

Speaking to BBC London politics editor Matthew d'Ancona outside Number 10, Mr Rees-Mogg said, "If I'm a party MP, I think the timing of the Article 50 trigger will give me pause.

"I think if they are going to give her the opportunity to trigger Article 50 it needs to be in a week, not in a month. In terms of a commitment on terms and conditions that the UK will get out of the European Union before then it needs to be made in a year."

However, Labour's Andrew Gwynne backed the move, saying it was "incredibly important it happens in time for the next London Marathon, when thousands of people would be running on these streets".
