 Idlib Province.

More than half a million civilians have fled their homes since the offensive began in December, the UN has said, including hundreds that have died from starvation or exposure since the fighting started in the winter of 2018.

A spokesman for Syria’s state news agency SANA said Syrian soldiers killed and captured “terrorists” in the south of the province at 11:00 local time on Monday, citing a statement by the army.

It said the soldiers were responding to fire from al-Qaida affiliated Hayat Tahrir al-Sham on government positions in the area at the time. Government-controlled media does not describe rebels as “terrorists”.

The attack in the village of Maaret al-Numan is the deadliest for months and the latest in a series of major losses suffered by Turkey-backed Syrian opposition fighters as the Syrian government, aided by Moscow and Tehran, has intensified its offensive against them.

“The Syrian Arab Army has today seized control of the village of Maaret al-Numan and parts of the village of Sahl Basha,” the army said. Idlib province was the last major rebel stronghold in Syria.

‘Savage massacre’

The Observatory said that in recent days more than 1,100 people have been displaced and that dozens of civilians and rebels have been killed.

“We confirm that these reports are true,” said Observatory Director Rami Abdel Rahman. “But more than 25 people have died because of the attacks.”

A medical relief team reached the hospital in Maaret al-Numan overnight, he said. “There were a lot of dead and wounded, and a lot of them are suffering from blood loss after fighting and from exposure.”

Witnesses in other parts of Idlib province said the death toll mounted as the night wore on.

The town of Kafranbel was bombed, killing several civilians, while in the village of Saraqeb, where the government said it gained control of al-Qaida-linked fighters, the dead included women and children, according to the Syrian Civil Defense, a volunteer rescue service.

The Observatory also said that government warplanes struck Marea,
