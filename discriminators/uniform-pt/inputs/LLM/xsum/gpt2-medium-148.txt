 and publicly, untrue".

The document alleges that, earlier in the election campaign, Ms Sturgeon had warned her cabinet colleagues that Mr Blair's comments about Gordon Brown had only encouraged the Labour leader's supporters. She also told colleagues the former prime minister was no longer "PM material".

A source with deep knowledge of the memo said: "If that is true it tells one thing, Nicola Sturgeon cannot win this election – even if Jeremy Corbyn did not want to be.

"She has to look at the fact that some cabinet ministers knew – well before the election – what he was saying."

That claim from the document, which first came to our attention on Thursday, has been repeated by an unnamed source close to the SNP party.

Tory candidates have repeatedly described Labour's poll lead at the last election as "unprecedented" – which they claim vindicated their message that "we need a Labour government before we can call a general election".

The SNP has suggested it is going to attack Labour over the memo and the Labour leader personally. The Labour campaign said yesterday Labour will make "an absolute hell of a lot of money" if the party wins independence.

Ed Miliband was invited to the Labour conference in Liverpool last week on a personal visit. His son, the shadow chancellor, insisted in the party conference: "The Lib Dems want a Scotland - what we promised people in 2007 - let's build up the economy and let's bring the NHS back into our communities."
