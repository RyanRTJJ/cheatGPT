The organisation has also launched a new campaign urging people to turn left and drive with caution.

“In the law this means a car driver turns as a matter of personal choice. But in reality, most drivers are law abiding pedestrians and drivers who give way when they have a right to do so.

“This new campaign is designed to encourage individuals and organisations to take a personal stand, whether that’s saying you’re going to turn and expect those you pass to give way, or encouraging the business you work for to make changes to their procedures."
