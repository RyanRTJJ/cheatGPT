 This time, a robot submarine took the pictures and reported back with a story.

The device was a 1.2-tonne robot in the shape of a small submarine, with a long, flat nose and six vertical propellers in a “V” formation. It was almost a complete robot: A propulsion unit and camera system were mounted on a deck on each side, with a tank in the middle. The tank contained a mix of chemicals and was heated to create a strong ultrasonic signal and make it detectable many kilometres away.

The robot’s job was to “detect, follow and photograph” what it was searching for in the Atlantic, according to the team’s reports. It took its first picture on 8 December off the coast of Portugal, where it reported that it was looking for a floating, cylindrical vessel with radar-like properties.

As it moved further down the ocean, it saw something much bigger – about 100 metres long and 20 metres wide – with what looked like propeller arms rising from each corner of the hull. This is where it spotted a sonar anomaly.

With the robot at last passing up the anomaly, the team decided to send it down again in search of other targets. It arrived off the coast of France on 10 December as it began its second survey of the Atlantic. It saw something that looked like another cylinder, and passed along a third report to its manager in charge of the project, Prof. David Mearns of the University of Warwick.

In the picture and a video published by the researchers, the vessel with the mysterious sonar-looking structure seems to rise to the surface. Scientists believe it’s a floating oil tanker but aren’t completely sure because of distance.

The mystery has now been solved. It’s a drill platform. This massive drilling rig, once the world’s largest, has been sitting on the sea floor in what the Japanese called an islet for years. Now the mystery has been solved, the drilling rigs (which appear to be drifting) have been found to be about 20 miles offshore – or 40 miles down from the rig, according to the International Association of Drilling Rig Owners (IADRO).
