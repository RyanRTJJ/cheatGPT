"This means we have to let around 550 migrants pass us," Frontex spokesman Simon Brodkin said.

A further 1,290 have been intercepted and "will continue on or on the Greek side of the territorial borders", with 2,440 on the way back either to Greece or Italy, he added.

They head up to Hungary in large groups of around 700, with those in the largest groups usually making it across, but others are stranded in the country because of police checks.
