 company to lose a senior executive than that person taking control of a rival.

Now, Guotai may have reason to ask itself just what they are doing here.

Yim Fung's predecessor as company chairman, Lee Ming-cheh, is the head of Guotai's Hong Kong affiliate and the board of directors has recently voted to add Wong to the board. The announcement came amidst a growing scandal in Shenzhen over Guotai's control of a major steelmaker and its subsidiary Zhejiang Kexin Steel and Power.

The decision to add Wong to the board of directors was made by Yim just a few days before the scandal came to light.

What's the real meaning behind the board of Guotai Securities' decision to add Wong to the board in order to avoid having the two executives on opposite sides of the same fence?

According to Bloomberg, Wong was instrumental in negotiating a contract between Guotai and an electricity-generating unit that the former was acquiring. The deal would see Guotai's investment worth more than $1 billion and its profits worth a further $300 million. During these negotiations, Wong allegedly had discussions with the unit and a decision was made to set up a joint venture in order to protect Yim's interests.

Although Wong was listed as a non-executive member of the executive committee, the main thing that appears to have swayed Yim to the decision was that Wong himself was involved in the decision making process.

Whether a decision has been taken to remove Wong is still not fully understood. Guotai is likely to question him about his involvement in the steel deal and also ask him whether he knows of other deals that are not public.

According to Guotai Vice Chairman Li Yuxian, Wong left before the deal was completed and has since left the company.

We will hopefully know more about Guotai's response to the ongoing scandal shortly.
