It was a hard day for the 29-year-old Frenchman as he crossed the line from the circuit to the race finish line at the finish line. He was on a fast lap in the 100km, and started out a bit short, but with the help of his back-up, he was able to climb out of a hole and hit the backstretch of his bike. The crash led to him and his family being taken to hospital and there are no further injuries, he said.

"He and his family are very happy," continued Estevez. "We would like to thank all the riders and friends who helped with his recovery. We wanted to give him the best possible training of time, but he was a fast rider, so we can't take any revenge.
