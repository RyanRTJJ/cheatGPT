 sharply in the third quarter of 2017.

"The QEUH figures show that the performance of acute departmental care services at QEUH in 2017 was below the levels predicted."

"This means that the overall performance in the performance of the QEUH A&E Department has been significantly below the targets set out by the NHS, leading to this inefficiencies affecting many patients.

"The NHS should consider the implications for patient recovery and accept the fact that such a significant number of patients have been left waiting longer for treatment and for carers in particular."

Dr James Hird, the chief executive of the QEUH, blamed changes to the NHS to staff morale and staff changes last year.

"We are pleased the Government will continue to work to improve our efficiency and are confident that the hospital will deliver on our commitment to deliver an excellent reputation for quality quality and customer service. At QeuH we understand the pressures that are driving some of these pressures and we are working to address them."

Hospital said last week that it had managed to keep its overall performance "within budget and within target" and the cost it was saving on treating the same numbers of patients was "below target".

In total it had cut 10,000 beds and 10,000 hours of treatment in a year, although this was only because of efficiencies in the hospital.

NHS England, having come under pressure to cut its deficit by $10bn, slashed the target of £40bn by £9bn and the total spending required to achieve this cut.

The NHS said it would make further decisions on costs next month and it will take the situation into account in planning its spending.
