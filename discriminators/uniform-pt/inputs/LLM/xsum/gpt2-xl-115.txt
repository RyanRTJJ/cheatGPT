 time he said he had to take the drugs to boost his confidence, but his actions have caused his young family to live in fear, said his sister, Sara, 24.

Khalaf, 25, was jailed for life yesterday for the murder of Mr Medina, aged 14, and for wounding his mother and sister-in-law, aged 38 and 18.

At Manchester crown court, the court was told that Khalaf, the son of the local imam, had repeatedly beat Mr Medina after he became angry at his 'nookie-eating' friends in Blackley, Greater Manchester.

The teenager denied the murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility, and of possessing extreme violence toward his mother and sister-in-law.

But a jury took just nine minutes to convict him of murder.

Khalaf was jailed earlier this month for three and a half years for throwing his father into a wood chipper because he had been drinking. The killing followed another alleged attack by Khalaf on his mother in April 2015, when he told her to "shut the f--- up" and pushed her down the stairs, causing bruising to her ribs.

Following the attack, mother Fatima, 40, a care assistant, said she was now living under police guard, fearful for her life.

Following the murder of Mr Medina, the teenager was found hiding in a garden behind a rubbish bin close to the Speakers' Corner.

As he fled, a neighbour, David Thomas, found Khalaf, then just 15, had kicked the corpse.

After the attack, Mr Thomas told jurors Khalaf repeatedly asked the teenager why he had caused Mr Medina to die by 'pooing' or urinating on him.

The teenager had appeared calm and composed at the time, said the prosecutor, who described as a 'champagne-swigging teenager' Khalaf as he stood there with blood on his head.

But Mr Thomas said Khalaf became increasingly agitated and he admitted to the neighbour he was the murderer.

The judge described Khalaf's murder as'shocking' and said he had "turned his anger around on the victim".
