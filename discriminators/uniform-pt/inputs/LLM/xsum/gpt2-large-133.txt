's behaviour; for example, the carmaker kept its customers' information confidential.

A spokesman for GM apologised for the problems, which he said would not affect business.

GM and Ford had made some changes to their networks which had brought them closer to the original timetable, the committee members said.

But the problems with the carmaker also showed it could not keep up with changes in the market, said the committee.

In recent months, BMW, Volkswagen and Renault have failed to deliver vehicles on schedule.

But "there has not been a comparable case", the committee members, including committee chairman Margaret Hodge, wrote in a letter read to MPs.

"We are unaware of the experiences of any other carmaker as to whether or not its executives have acted responsibly," they said.

This suggests "the need to establish a clear corporate culture of accountability and accountability for what is happening across all key UK car-makers at the moment," they said.

The committee wants companies to publish more financial data, such as profit, costs and sales, and to do more to encourage staff to report flaws to management.

'Significant delays'

Last week, GM said that the backlog of UK orders was 10% higher than it expected, bringing its total to some 13.6m vehicles in the UK.

"These delays should not have occurred as we have made significant progress to address the issues we face and have a plan in place to deal with these issues to keep the UK car industry competitive," a spokesman said.
