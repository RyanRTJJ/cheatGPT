 are electronic storage devices that were allegedly tampered with and then sent out to its clients.

In all, a total of 15 banknotes that were manufactured in 2012, 2013 and 2014 may have been targeted through a series of allegedly faulty machines over 13 months, the Financial Crimes Task Force (FCTF) said. Four of the banknotes were issued between June 2014 and late January 2016, after which the FCTF said it became aware of five other alleged breaches which remained unresolved at the time of the investigation.

"A group of approximately five banknotes had been manufactured by Commonwealth Bank in the period between February 2014 and last week," the task force said in a statement on Thursday.

The FCTF said it was unable to provide a detailed breakdown of the names of clients, but it also said the number of cases being investigated exceeded 60,000.

It has also begun investigation into whether any accounts linked to the alleged misconduct may also have been sold.

"It appears that the money was distributed directly between those who engaged in the wrongdoing and those whose accounts were affected, while at the same time it was transferred through a third party account. The third party's identity was not disclosed to the bank at the time the transfer occurred, and the amount of money involved can only have resulted from the improper distribution of funds," the FCTF said.

According to the task force, many of the accounts at Commonwealth Bank contained fraudulent or "ghost" money to disguise the underlying account, the report was not able to elaborate further.

In a statement on Wednesday, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said "Australian consumers know that no one should ever make a mistake."

The actions against Commonwealth Bank will not result in any prosecutions. The bank says there is no evidence Commonwealth Bank has or would have created any bank machines that were misused or compromised, and claims that they have already fixed its IDMs, however, it is now conducting an ongoing review of the bank's supply chain.
