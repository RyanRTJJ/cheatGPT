In April the BBC's The World at One opened in London with 16,000 people crammed into the stage a little over half an hour after that. Since then, the show has been filmed at two other venues - Glasgow's Ballymena Stadium and Sheffield Hallam's Wembley Stadium.

The first of those events was Saturday's match between Arsenal FC and Liverpool FC at Manchester City, which featured a dramatic performance of "We Are Champions".

In April 2010, after the show's premiere, David Moyes announced an 18 minute broadcast of Radio Times. The show has been picked up by multiple channels which are currently owned by BT and Sky stations in the United States.

The BBC and BBC2 also have hit the headlines for allegedly being "politically correct" as viewers watched "The Voice" from different platforms.

On Thursday, ITV's current programme The World Tonight started on Sky after being replaced by "Hollywood Life".

It also is reported on Friday that ITV has decided to stop going on its current programmes. As a result, many of those who tuned out that Saturday's show are now paying the BBC £100 (£40) per minute for that show.

'Dumb idea'

It is reported by the BBC that the change of heart has put the broadcaster behind this week's final BBC show "The World At One", which concluded at 14:10 GMT.

It is also reported that The Voice UK is "deeply disappointed" by what they saw on Friday night when they watched Mr Moyes' show on 4chan.

The voice of "Hollywood Life" has already been replaced by "Hollywood Life", which will be broadcast at 12:45 BST on 21 June.
