 said it "will take disciplinary action where officers have acted unlawfully".

Officers are also liaising with the Independent Police Complaints Commission to determine whether there's any "potential criminality".

A spokesman for Cheshire Police said: "Cheshire Constabulary takes the issue of child sexual exploitation very seriously. Our officers will never tolerate this behaviour from anyone."

'Over 18s paying for under-18s'

The BBC has spoken to a number of parents who want to remain anonymous, and has seen a number of Facebook groups and websites where men are advertising child sexual exploitation on dating sites.
