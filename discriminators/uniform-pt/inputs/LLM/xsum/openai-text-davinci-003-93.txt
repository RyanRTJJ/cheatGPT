 improve the journey times.

Rail Fair's campaign is calling for funding to upgrade train routes between Lincoln and Nottingham. This would involve infrastructure and timetable improvements which would reduce the journey time between the cities by an estimated 15-20 minutes. The upgrades would create a faster and more efficient railway route, which would benefit both those commuters, tourists, and those travelling for business. Rail Fair is campaigning for this upgrade in the hope that it would have a positive impact on the economies of both cities, by reducing journey times and making their respective regions more attractive to businesses, investors and tourists alike.
