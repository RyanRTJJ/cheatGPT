e discovered he had been using the franking machine to buy and sell stamps, claiming they were worth more than they actually were.

Mr. McGuire was charged with breach of trust and three counts of fraud. He pleaded guilty to all four charges and was sentenced to three years and nine months in prison.

The court heard that Mr. McGuire had used the franking machine on 93 occasions over a nine-month period and had made a total of £43,918.80 in profits. He would then purchase the stamps, but list them as higher value on eBay.

The fraud was uncovered when National Museum of Scotland staff noticed that more postage stamps were purchased from their franking machine than what had been indicated in the monthly accounts. The police were alerted and the subsequent investigations revealed that the stamps had been purchased via eBay with Mr. McGuire’s accounts.

Mr. McGuire was subject to confiscation proceedings and was compelled to pay a proceeds of crime order of £28,052.81. He was also sentenced to 230 hours of unpaid work and was ordered to pay the museum losses of £11,161.95.
 
Scottish justice secretary Michael Matheson said:"Fraudulent activity of this type damages public trust and undermines the hard work of charities such as the National Museum of Scotland. I would urge any charity or business that sees something that appears suspicious to contact the police immediately.”
