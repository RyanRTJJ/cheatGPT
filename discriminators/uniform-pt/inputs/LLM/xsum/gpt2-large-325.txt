 a letter from their employer in recent months.

They include small manufacturers, companies with 10 or fewer staff but which include some businesses, according to the campaign group for the union Unison.

The number of workers receiving anonymous letters has increased significantly. It has doubled from 5,000 to 11,000 since the beginning of 2014, according to the Campaign for an Independent Arbitration (CA).

The CA had calculated that the number of anonymous letters was rising by an average of one a week.

'Laws that are not enforced'

The Campaign for Fair Pay & Conditions, which was formed to push for laws and penalties which would apply in the workplace, has been calling for the law to be strengthened.

Unison says there are currently more than 100,000 unfair dismissal cases where companies are failing to meet the strict requirements set by the law.

"The public are not getting the right message," said Unison general secretary Frances O'Grady.

"There has been a steady increase of workers who are now receiving anonymous letters as it goes through the system.

"This is undermining the ability of the workplace to protect these workers from discrimination.

"The government needs to make it clear that they have no interest in supporting the right of workers to stand up to bad employers, but rather are pursuing laws that are not enforced."

A senior government spokesman said the government had already made progress in increasing the number of workers receiving anonymous letters.

He said: "Employing more people means we need better protections for employees against discrimination - that is where we have been focused this Parliament, and where we will continue making progress once the new Industrial Relations Regulations come into force in 2017."

Families' minister Anna Soubry told the BBC: "Companies should be taking this seriously".

She added that the coalition government has introduced legislation in three successive parliaments to ensure "employee rights are enforced".
