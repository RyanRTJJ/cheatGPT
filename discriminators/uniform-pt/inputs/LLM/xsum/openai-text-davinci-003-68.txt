 from some politicians, notably the Lib Dems, for the Assembly to be allowed to rise to 80 or even 90 members.

The Commission established a review group, led by former Lib Dem AM Peter Black, to consider the case. The group reported in June of this year.

The group noted the rise in constituency populations since the 2007-8 controversy over whether constituencies already had too many voters in them.

It acknowledged research from the Electoral Reform Society which suggested allowing some six extra Assembly constituencies would improve the accuracy of Welsh representation in the UK Parliament.

And it also suggested there could be a case for additional Regional Members to provide greater balance between the geographical constituency members, and those elected on a list system.

Today, the Commision has formally accepted all seven key recommendations made by the review group.

The Assembly's Presiding Officer Elin Jones declared that Wales "deserves nothing less than the most effective legislature possible", adding that a larger Assembly would be better equipped to provide "meaningful oversight of Welsh Government and Parliamentary scrutiny of the UK Government".

The Commission has:

* Agreed to ask the Boundary Commission for Wales to look into the case for six additional constituency seats, which it will report back by Spring 2020.

* Agreed to ask the Boundary Commission for Wales for an interim review by Summer 2019 to assess the case for establishing two additional top-up regions in South and Mid Wales with two or three new seats in each.

* Explored further the various electoral options with regard to the geographical balance of members

* Agreed to explore options for the participation of members who are not elected - for example, through advisory bodies such as the Assemblyâ€™s Standing Committee on Environment and Sustain
