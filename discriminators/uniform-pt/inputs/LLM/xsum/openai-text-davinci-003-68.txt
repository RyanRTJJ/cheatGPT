r sentences for those convicted of terror offences.

The memo said: "We are anxious to ensure that sentences are structured so that potential for use of [TLR] is as fully as possible in the interests of managing risk."

It said the scheme - which had been used since 2008 - could help "enable sentences to be served in the least expensive way, while managing the risk posed".

The Ministry of Justice said it was "proud" of the scheme and said it "annually assesses" the risk posed by offenders.

In an emailed response, it said: "Only those assessed as posing a low risk are eligible to participate and they must adhere strictly to the supervision and other requirements of the order".

The memo was sent to Justice Secretary David Gauke in March. He had asked for advice on how to ensure sentences were structured to "maximise the use" of Tethering and Location Restriction (TLR) orders.

The orders allow offenders to remain in the same area - subject to curfew and regular check-ins - rather than be sent to prison.

In 2016, 131 people were released from prison under the scheme - including 30 convicted of terror-related offences - compared with 111 in the previous year.

The Ministry of Justice said the scheme is an important part of managing risk and providing effective rehabilitation of offenders.

The statement added: "Those convicted of terrorism offences vary widely in terms of their behaviour and attitudes, and the level of risk and danger they pose. Each case is separately assessed against exacting criteria and TLRs are only considered where they are in the best interests of both the offender, and the public."
