 said it was fair to assume the review will “have an impact on the amount of money that Stormont will get from Westminster or, more specifically, the size of the block grant”.

The review, scheduled to begin in early 2021 and to be completed by the end of the summer, aims to ensure that the block grant and other public funds are being used efficiently, effectively, and cost effectively. The review will also consider whether funds could be used more effectively and consider any potential changes that might be needed for Stormont’s approach to public sector funding.

The review will be conducted by an independent panel comprised of relevant experts, who will examine the operations of different government departments and local government to ensure resources are being used in the most efficient and effective ways possible.

The review will also look at the potential for collaboration across government departments, local government and other public bodies to improve effectiveness and efficiency. It could potentially recommend the establishment of centralised strategic partners, such as a joint-Integrated Care Board, that oversee collaboration between organisations and promote best-practice.

The outcomes of the review will be presented to ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive. If ministers accept the recommendations, they will then need to work out how to implement them in terms of budgeting and drawing up detailed implementation plans.

A key element of the review is likely to be a realignment of public finance. This means that there could be significant shift in where funds are allocated and how they are divided across Stormont departments and local government. It’s likely that any changes resulting from the review will take time to fully implement, and their individual impacts on departmental budgets will only become clear in the medium to long term.
