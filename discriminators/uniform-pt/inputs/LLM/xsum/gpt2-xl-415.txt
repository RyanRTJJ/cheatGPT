, had been making custom skis for clients since 1992.

However, the $50,000 cost of the replacement keel had been set aside as part of a settlement agreement with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.

Mr Innes didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from the Sunday Herald.

Stormforce co-owner David Moulton told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) that the company started to think about cancelling the skis last year after having considered hiring an engineer who was experienced in building large sections of ice.

"In the end we were pretty adamant that we weren't going to take that risk and we would be better off keeping the keel where it is," Mr Moulton said. "And our belief was the keel would be safer."

However, it's been four months since the ice incident, and Stormforce has been trying to sell the skis only sporadically.

"It's still something we are concerned about," Mr Moulton acknowledged.

Another company, C-K, which sells custom poles has had more success with selling its skis.

The skis, which include a retractable hook on each end, are made from carbon-fibre, a Kevlar-like plastic material.

Mr Innes told CBC News last year that the company only makes one other "giant" pole in the world, the $200,000 Kaleo.

The company had received hundreds of orders but was slow to produce the big poles.

But it's not just the big poles that are having trouble.

The company is now offering a $200 discount if customers email.

The company also has made a run of some more affordable models, including the $100,000 Cheeki. According to the CBC, this model has already drawn enough interest to make it available to customers in Quebec

The firm is already making plans to increase production, Mr Moulton told CBC News.

However, the firm said it hasn't yet seen any demand from interested buyers.

The Cheeki-Rafiki was one of three large ice fishing boats that made the 300-mile journey to Newfoundland, on the north-east
