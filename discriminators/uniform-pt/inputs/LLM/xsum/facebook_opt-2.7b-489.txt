 season.

"He's in his pre-season with us so we'll get him straight across as soon as we can," said Wakefield head coach Chris Chester.

"We won't rush it, we'll make sure he's OK. He had an operation just before the end of the season, but we think there'll be another operation.

"We won't know for sure until the end of January at this stage, but it's likely he will play next year."

Suliasi Vunivalu scored a vital try in Wakefield's 18-10 defeat in his first game at the Super League season opener, but Chester is without his regular starting half-back partner and says Jamie Jones-Buchanan has a chance of breaking into the international scene.

Jones-Buchanan was in outstanding form in the opening-round win over Hull KR, with the Wakefield head coach backing the 22-year-old to break into the British and Irish Lions pack.

"Jamie has been a big part of us since he was a kid and worked extremely hard to get back here, so he's shown his potential and he's going to be a big part of this year for us," added Chester.

"I think he could get a place in the (British and Irish Lions) squad.

"He showed last year how valuable he is, he was very strong, he was hard to run through.

"It's just a matter of getting the game-time to get better."

Wakefield kick off their Super League campaign at home against Widnes Vikings on Sunday.
