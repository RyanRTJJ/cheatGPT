 Romans, pirates and even the Spanish and Portuguese.

In the modern era, the site of the medieval town centre stands at a height of 10ft above sea level - much higher than modern skyscrapers of similar length. According to the UNESCO World Heritage site, the city became the largest in ancient Europe when the town centre was built over a lake in the 6th century BC on the banks of the Meek. The lake today holds vast deposits of Roman and Greek pottery.

The project has attracted the interest of archaeologists as they strive to uncover the earliest known settlement on the island and one of the oldest in North Africa.

Although no archeological evidence exists to support the notion of modern town planning in the time of the Phoenicians, archaeologists believe that Rome's control over the site continued for many centuries, with its development being closely tracked by the Phoenicians and ultimately in turn by the Venetians and Romans.

The site has long been considered to contain a 'hidden' town that had existed within the lake for its entirety and that was known for its beauty and history.

However, the discovery of a 'fairy tale' town centre in the lake has led to concerns about the true story of this ancient town.

While the discovery of a 'fairy tale' town centre in the lake has led to fears about the true picture of the ancient town, experts are hoping that one could not only confirm the existence of this ancient settlement, but also to add to its archaeological legacy.

The ancient riverine town began life during the period when the island of Plis and its neighbours lay beyond the city of Etruria (today in Turkey) on the Black Sea coast.

The Greeks (c. 1st century BC) founded a Greek town in the area, where the main town centre is known as Plium.

Pli was the centre of the first Greek culture, the most famous of which included Alexander of Macedon, whose journey from Sparta to the island of Rhodes took him south through modern-day Turkey.
