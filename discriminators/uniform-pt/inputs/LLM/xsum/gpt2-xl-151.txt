 to consult people before carrying out any major reorganisation across whole populations, the body said.

But Dr Philippa Roe, a GP and chair of the RCGP Scotland GP committee, said it was time to go back to the NHS's "golden age" of "one-stop-shop" access rather than a model based on the private sector.

A spokesperson for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said that local healthcare systems "deliver an excellent level of care" to their patients.

"In recent times, Scottish Government and others have introduced greater co-ordinated NHS care to many parts of our community, with over £10bn of additional funding for local NHS spending – bringing the total budget for NHS services for Scotland to around £12bn," the spokesperson said.

"This investment in local NHS services also allows us to deliver services to those in need who would otherwise receive care from hospitals and social services."

The RCGP Scotland committee agreed that "all types of treatment have their place". But there is a danger of adding "unnecessary layers", a spokesman for the group added.

Catherine Mordaunt MSP, chair of the Scottish Labour shadow health committee, said: "If the Government is serious it should reverse its decisions to merge hospitals and GP practices."

In its consultation on changing the constitution (Scotland) Bill, the Scottish Government outlined plans to transfer responsibility for GP regulation to the Scottish NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).

But the NHS's general practitioner committee has warned that GP changes and "injuries inflicted" on patients by increased numbers of patients can also make patients wait longer. They have called for a "robust and effective commissioning arrangements" to ensure patients do not "undermine" the NHS.

Dr Roe said that the proposed commissioning arrangements would impose "major costs" by setting out "very specific timetables for commissioning and commissioning activity" and added that a proposed national GP service in Scotland would "almost certainly be a financial disaster".

"I think these changes are totally unnecessary, will lead to unnecessary pressures on GP services, will put pressure on GP practices, will lead to patients waiting longer and the possibility of unnecessary and injurious injuries being inflicted on them," she said.
