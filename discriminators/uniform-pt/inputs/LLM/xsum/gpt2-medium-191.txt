 Salaried Staffs Association (STSA), representing all railway workers in Lancashire and Cumbria from 6 October, will go on strike.

On Thursday morning, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) announced that it had decided that more than 200 striking rail staff, including train stewards, would work from midnight to 8am on a six-day strike.

The rail strike comes after the announcement on March 21 that the railway strike committee for Greater Manchester, which includes the UK Transport Authority (UKTA), has agreed that train crew will be offered a pay package of £10 each day to enable them to train, do maintenance and to carry out their duties.


However, the TUC is not backing the deal – the current offer is £9.80 and the TUC said there would be a pay freeze on maintenance staff, who are responsible for cleaning and maintaining some rail services and delivering them to stations. (For full details on the RMT dispute, see 'Rail strike action' below.)

The TUC and Trades Union Congress are calling for a 40-day industrial action, or lockout, should the rail strike committee accept the government's new offer.


But the Government refused a request to allow the government to call a second industrial action. Trades unions believe that if the strike committee makes these changes in their first bid to reach agreement, the strikes could break out further before the next General Secretary of the RMT resigns in the weekend.

As part of the TUC action plans, rail strike committees are expected to take one additional vote on next Friday, the day of the industrial action. In this case, the Government would have a two-thirds majority over the strike committees to pass any amendments to the strike committee's proposals.

But a Tufa spokeswoman said the Government was seeking to force a vote on this motion before the next General Secretary quit on Saturday with or without the support of the TUAs.
