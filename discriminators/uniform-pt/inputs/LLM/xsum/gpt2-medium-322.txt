 adding, "She told no lies, no untruths. â€¦We felt awful."

Marchbank had previously given the family several options. "Our options were probably 'you just shut me down.'" Asking in detail, Marchbank said that in an attempt to make it rain on our feet.

The final option was to go to courts to ask for a "disappointed customer resolution" form which would have included the charge. The case was initially set for trial in December 2009 with one side representing Marchbank and the other representing Marchbank's mother, Miles. A court date was set for June 2010.

When it was finally determined that no charges would be possible, Marchbank told the court in court, she left the case without answering questions. "I should've said something. I should've said that [I] don't agree with your decision but that my legal team would work through this," she said.

In June 2010 the court ruled on a motion to dismiss the complaint.

Miles denied giving Marchbank the money she was told her mother wasn't rich enough to pay. In court, a doctor from a national private health insurance network testified there was "not much" Miles had in the bank account. The bank has since been fined $75,000, fined for "unreasonable or fraudulent conduct."

The money issue has been a litmus test for lawyers all day who are trying a series of complex cases in the Bay Area. For Miles, it's been something of a nightmare, and it's only recently found its way into her life again.

I asked Marchbank about the two-dozen forms she says she had in her hands on Friday that she said were given to her by her mother, who had been diagnosed and then died in
