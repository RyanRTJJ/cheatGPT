Three other blood bags have since been identified: those of Lance Armstrong, Floyd Landis and Brian Dixon, which were sent to Dr Sánchez and stored until 2009.

"The operation that happened 10 years ago has given us this evidence," said Detective Superintendent Pablo Mijares, of the Puerto de la Paz Police Force, in a press release.

He added that one member of the Dr Sánchez-based doping gang has died in prison as a result of cancer, but he provided no information.

But he added that a lot more is already known about the Puerto de la Paz blood scandal, including who was sent to prison for drug dealing there.

"It's a very long, long story, but I can tell you that there was only one player who got caught," he added.

Puerto de la Paz was also the site of a large-scale drug-dealing and money-laundering operation known as "El Pueblo," which according to former President Barack Obama's National Drug Control Strategy report was responsible for half of all cocaine seized in Mexico in 2013.

In 2013, the DEA moved about 60 kilograms of cocaine from Puerto de la Paz to Houston, Texas, in one of the most sophisticated drug smuggling operations ever pulled off.
