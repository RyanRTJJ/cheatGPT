 showed holidaymakers saved £32 when buying in a resort rather than a city, where prices are often double or more.

Other findings highlight the value of a good bargain. Those who did their research and booked flights at a competitive price cut costs by £18.98. The paper also found that those travellers who chose the cheapest hotel room cost £1,500 more than the most expensive option.

Mr Mandy said: "I have found in my research many cheap airline flights or hotels for a fraction of the cost advertised. So it pays to do your own research. Remember to check that what is advertised is actually available before opting for it."

Travel expert Mike Bevan, who owns Travel and Holidays in Bude said: "We all know holidays are just one of the cost of travelling and not the only cost. However, the real costs of a holiday still lie in the hidden costs that aren't even seen by the consumer, such as fuel, accommodation, car hire and travel insurance. However, not only do airline companies set the price of flights and hotels by advertising the lowest for each type of flight and hotel we know, but these are only a small part of what most consumers experience during their holiday.

"Our customers often tell us they are surprised about the cost of air travel because other websites such as TripAdvisor and Google show air fares can vary a great deal and it has proved difficult for many to negotiate a deal from the best airlines and hotels."
