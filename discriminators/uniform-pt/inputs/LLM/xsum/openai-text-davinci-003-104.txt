It's an admission that will no doubt come as a surprise and dismay to many families who have been gutted by the devastating mosquito-borne virus.

"This virus re-emerged at the end of the 1970s and we have been playing catch-up ever since," Dr Chan said.

"We dropped the ball. We missed the opportunity to get ahead of the curve."

Mosquitoes in the Zika virus family is believed to be the vector for the virus

Dr Chan said the WHO was working to ensure health systems had the capacity to "respond appropriately" to the disease, and was working with researchers to develop vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments.

"The Zika virus story is far from over," she said.

"Let this be an historic moment and a call to action: let us make sure that never again are we caught unprepared."

The WHO director-general said the agency's response had been hampered by a lack of resources and the need to prioritise other diseases.

"Let us be frank, the impact of Zika has been amplified by past failures to invest in the health systems and capacities that can prevent, detect and respond to outbreaks," she said.

"Too many countries, particularly in the tropics, lack the resources, structures, and policies needed to sustain essential public health functions."

While the number of new Zika cases has been declining, Dr Chan warned that the virus remained a threat.

"We must remain vigilant," she said.

"The mosquito that transmits Zika is present in many other parts of the world and if the virus were to be introduced, it could spread rapidly and widely."
