“The council is the only viable choice if an agreement is to be reached,” the rebel source cited by al-Hayat said, adding that representatives of the Houthis would go to the Yemeni capital Sanaa to agree a deal with the government forces on Saturday.

Saudi-led Arab troops launched a major offensive on Yemen in 2015 to roll back the Houthis, who seized control of Sanaa in 2014 and then captured swathes of the country, including the capital last year.

The war has since killed more than 10,000 people, the vast majority civilians, according to the UN, and the Saudi-led coalition has come under intense criticism for its bombardments of residential areas.

The rebels on Wednesday formed the governing council aimed at restoring the government of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who resigned months after the start of the war to protest against the Houthis’ takeover.

Yemen’s President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi left the capital last month, citing security reasons, having held talks with rebels to try to end the war.

Saudi Arabia and its allies announced a ceasefire on Wednesday in a major diplomatic breakthrough, after a war that has killed 10,000 people since 2015.

The Saudi-led coalition supporting President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi on Thursday signed a ceasefire agreement in a rebel-held city, in a major step towards resuming talks to end the conflict.

The ceasefire on the port city of Hodeida would be a “first step towards achieving a lasting peace” in the war-scarred country, said a Saudi-led coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Maliki.

The UN peace envoy for Yemen said on Wednesday that he was hopeful a truce would hold next week for key ports and a key highway to the Red Sea from which key imports are shipped.

Martin Griffiths’ comments came after the UN said it has received an official request from Hadi’s Saudi-backed government pledging to support any talks.

Griffiths said he hoped talks would happen next week in Sweden, where UN envoy Martin Griffiths has been meeting in recent days with the Yemeni government and the Iranian-backed Houthis.
