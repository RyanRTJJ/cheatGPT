 decision to allow the unconventional gas to be developed on land held by the local community.

The company plans to use a fracking technique to break gas atoms open - a technology not approved by the European Union - and then drill into the rock for the gas.

The technique, known as high pressure water injection - known as HPSI - involves blasting water and chemicals deep underground - the first time shale gas has been used on any scale for shale gas extraction.

The company hopes to have its wells up and running in around a year's time. It has already begun the process of pumping water into the wells, and says it expects it to be 'fully operational' by the end of this year.

This week North Yorkshire Council confirmed it had agreed to grant Planning permission to extract shale gas on the Kirby Misperton site but rejected a petition which had been lodged with the council following the company's successful application.

A spokesman for Friends of the Earth said: 'We welcome today's news that a consent has been granted to Kirby Misperton, and hope this marks a turning-point in the campaign for shale gas in east Yorkshire.

'But we are continuing to call on landowners to take strong action to prevent this huge new shale gas development happening here.

'The majority of this country remains unconvinced by fracking. At the moment shale gas is being built on top of ground filled with toxic coal ash dust from new abandoned coal mines in our area. That is no way to produce a new energy source if it is not at the heart of a true sustainable economy.

'It would be impossible to extract shale gas by using HPSI without blasting coal ash deep underground, as well as producing a lot of energy and pollution. It would be an unsustainable and environmentally unnecessary system if we did not see this gas extraction approved.'

North Yorkshire's environment spokesman Martin Horwood said: 'Friends of the Earth will use this opportunity to call on the Secretary of State to take this threat to our environment very seriously.

'For the future of our environment, and people's health, we need government to keep on top of this fracking campaign so that fracking comes
