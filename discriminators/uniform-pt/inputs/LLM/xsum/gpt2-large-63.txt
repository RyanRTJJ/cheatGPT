 the Irish Times when he made a comparison between the SNP and the Labour Party, which had the support of an astonishing 50% of the population in the 1930s: "We have moved with one hand tied behind our backs. That's a very scary position to be in," he said, adding that he feared for the rest of the UK and the EU, but that it was "not possible" to ignore the UK. The Independent and Telegraph have both reported on his comments.

He said that he thought that when the SNP was set up in 1969, it was not true that they thought it would be a power-sharing government with the Labour government. He said many in the Scottish Labour movement in the 1960s had thought that they should become "the social base to put one or two radical Scottish Tories forward", but that did not quite work; instead Labour lost about 40 seats.

One of the biggest changes to the SNP, he said, was one with which he was very aware. "The Scottish Labour establishment has never been more or more in thrall than it is to an English and English-speaking bourgeoisie, but of course their idea of a socialist state is a state in which they are on top of a global market economy, the state of a capitalist capitalist state." He dismissed the notion of independence as a mere political construct:

I am not going to take a position on a constitutional convention. In the end it's an academic exercise and I don't care as a socialist about it. But it is very curious to me that Scottish Labour, like the English and English-speaking people in their party, has been reduced to this obsession that independence is something that's going to have some sort of impact on the economic life of Scottish society, that it will have an impact on the welfare state, and everything else is an afterthought. That is a serious danger for Labour in Scotland and
