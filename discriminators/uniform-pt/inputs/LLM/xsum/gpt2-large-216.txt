 looked after. She had not thought Ms Reid was in danger.

"She has never left my door and she has never come home," Ms Reid told the Sunday Telegraph. "I don't think I would have done anything differently."

Ms Reid's parents are being reunited with her within the next six days.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said a visa had been issued for Ms Reid and an asylum claim had been "accepted by a competent tribunal".

Twitter accounts allegedly belonging to her and her sister Sarah have more than 7,500 followers each.

According to her family, the accounts were created on 4th December, but did not get as many likes as they had hoped. They said the accounts were deleted within a few days.

A Foreign Office spokesperson said: "This is very serious and has now been reported to the police. We don't believe it is a joke. We will be meeting these girls in the UK to help with their asylum claims."

Ms Reid's father said he was not surprised her account was shut down.

"We all know they're doing it [making fake accounts]," he said.

"She's never taken this seriously. She's one of our own. They think it's funny to target her."

His daughter's family have not been in contact.

"I don't know what's going to happen now.

"Obviously I'm not going to say anything, because obviously she won't tell me.

"I'm probably going to go back to work and deal with this."

Ms Reid became "inseparable" after her parents separated.

They have no idea what is happening to her at this point, in the weeks from 11 December into this week.
