 reform package that aims to reduce tax receipts and stimulate public and private investment through a variety of measures.

According to the Finance Ministry, the package is designed to stimulate the economy in response to a series of negative economic indicators including falling industrial and energy production and a trade gap that grew from $21.7bn during the end of last year to $27.7bn. The IMF estimates total public debt for South Korea will surpass 120 per cent of GDP this year, the highest in the OECD.

The government also hopes its spending package will improve consumer confidence and spur consumer spending by lifting the current minimum wage, which South Korea's finance minister Chung Mong-keun argues at $6.20 per hour as well as the purchasing power of low-income earners and the elderly.

Mr Chung has vowed to reduce Korea's trade surplus by cutting corporate tax rates, raising the country's foreign investment limit and implementing a value-added tax that will apply to all products except for food from this autumn.

The last stimulus package approved in August 2011 aimed at securing a further 2.6% rise in public lending. The $10.7bn package will increase the public debt to around 92% of GDP next year, from about 91% this year.

South Korean President Park Geun Hye plans on signing it on Friday, but a special summit session on Friday will be dedicated to the package, rather than a parliamentary vote, to avoid it clashing with the May 9 general elections.

Mr Chung is a member of the Saenuri Party, which Park Geun Hye belongs to and the package is largely a reflection of party policy. The opposition is calling for a vote on it after Friday's special session, saying it violates the constitutional principle of separation of powers. Some analysts predict the vote against the package can be close, as the government retains a majority in parliament.

The government's moves also come at a time of heightened tension on the North Korean peninsula. The first summit between US President
