 been reported to security.

The alleged plotters could allegedly be led by an inmate named "The Warden" who had been recently released, prosecutors said in a statement made ahead of the raids. Warden is said to have acted as both a driver and the security chief of the prison which is in the town of Maasvlakte, in central the Dutch province of Zeeland.

The suspects allegedly ordered an underground bunker-style home to be built around the prison, and would allow the inmates to live in it as they did during the night, when they spent no time in the outhouse.

According to the US federal government, more than 200 inmates at the prison had escaped in the previous two decades, prompting the US State Department to issue an alert to US citizens to steer clear of the area.

The authorities have said that they have arrested the alleged suspects and that a joint American and German task force is searching for the underground bunker.

During the raids on 14 September, the US National Security Agency (NSA) reportedly caught a glimpse in a webcam of two men who have taken part in the escape, according to local media. A spokesman for German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere did not confirm the arrest was made but said that the man was "a German of Algerian origin".

Although the exact nature of the escape remains unknown, reports in Dutch media claimed at least seven inmates were involved, according to the BBC. There was speculation that security staff had managed to alert the inmates by using the same alarm system.

Dutch prosecutors said that the alleged plot was part of a broader movement to smuggle weapons through the Netherlands – which has been known to contain "terrorist cells" in order to prevent them from moving to places where they face increasing persecution – and smuggle money back to Yemen, in the form of counterfeit cash in the form of CDs, according to the Express newspaper.
