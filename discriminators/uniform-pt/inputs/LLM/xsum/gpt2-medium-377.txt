 Washington Post suggest Seattle isn't alone in banning bottled water, and is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country with more than 4 million people.

An analysis of statistics by the Seattle Times shows the growth since 2006 has outstripped overall growth in the nation. Seattle's average population jumped from 6.6 in 2006 to 11.3 now. By 2036, Seattle could have 10 times more people than it does now.

Water sales are booming

A Washington Post analysis of data shows that for many years there was some water left behind in the pipes during the Seattle storm in 2006, and that has grown.

There was nearly enough water left in a typical household within a few months of the Seattle storm to fill 1,000 U.S. Olympic-size swimming pools. And the Washington State Department of Geography notes that by that time, 1.3 million gallons had been collected during a typical rainstorm.

In contrast, the city's water is now a few inches lower than it was, according to city estimates, and people using it to flush toilets or flush their plumbing are flushing out or washing up when the water is less than two and a half feet deep.

Water conservation is also a priority. The city has a 100-megawatt desalination plant on site, generating enough water to meet the city's needs six days a week for more than 100 weeks.

The problem is public perception is that Seattle is flush with water. Its citizens' attitudes have started to change, with new measures being put in place from last year, after a series of deaths related to illness linked to Seattle's waters.

"We're really looking forward to trying something new," said Mark Liggo, executive director of the Washington Department of Health, who has been a critic of the city's policies. "We recognize that this is a really big problem."

On the campaign trail this fall, Gov. Jay Inslee (D) was skeptical of water conservation efforts, telling the Seattlepi that they were about the use
