 internet security was at the heart of China's recent Olympic bid and protests over a new policy that allows the family members of national heroes to be buried in the country's national cemeteries.

The two sites were linked since 2009 when authorities moved to disrupt the accounts. In recent months, the authorities have tightened control of internet activity, blocking websites, and in some cases arrests have resulted in convictions, including the case of an official in Guiyang province, according to state media.

Officials in Shenzhen and Yiwu have expressed anger over a local government's crackdown on the two sites. Chen Qingxun, the director of local government at Guiyang, said: "We were not informed of the ban on Sina and Tencent before the decision was announced. If our citizens get online before the ban and are guilty of cyber crime, they can expect to be investigated and be prosecuted."

Zhang Hongjiang at the Center for Internet Safety, a Beijing-based non-profit organisation, said: "If you go on to the website of the sites [Sina and Tencent], you can see the banner which says Chinese government internet security is in force."

An officer with the Yiwu police department said the police had been asked to "monitor social media to ensure such sites stay in good order". "We would like everyone in the Chinese village to cooperate," the officer said. "The Yiwu government has made a good approach, and we want everyone to do the same."

While the authorities have said that they are conducting regular checks on internet use, they have not explained just why these sites had taken the ban in their stride, given the sensitivity of the issue.

There have been concerns that these sites may be used to illegally access the most sensitive information, such as that held in the National Assembly and other cabinet meetings.

Internet use in China has increased dramatically as the population has grown and the amount of information available online has grown in number.
