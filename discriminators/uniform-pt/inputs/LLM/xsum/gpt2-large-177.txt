Teachers' average paid leave in 2013 averaged 33.7 hours, but the EIS found the average length of teachers' official leave fell by 24 hours to 11.5 hours. At the same time, teachers' average full-time jobs decreased by 21.9 hours a year, from 4,092 hours in 2011/12 to 4,056 hours in 2012/13.

A spokesperson for the Scottish Executive, which runs the Scottish education system, said: "Teachers, like other staff, work extremely long hours and are paid significantly less than other workers," adding: "The EIS report shows that this has led to a significant decline in teacher workload. Teachers are working longer, on average, than ever before but are still earning less than their peers. We believe this means there is still a long way to go to meet the educational needs of our young people."

The EIS estimates that teaching jobs across Scottish government are in a "critical' state. More than half of all primary teacher posts have yet to be filled, and all of which are set to be vacant for a long time. There is a growing shortage of teacher and support assistants; schools are cutting staff and staff of specialist jobs.

It concludes that: "The EIS believes that public sector teachers should be paid £8,000 per year, which will give them average annual full-time earnings of £24,000 a year. This will see the average Scottish teaching job earning the highest amount ever for a Scottish public sector teacher by the end of the century."

On the day when the EIS issued its report, a spokesperson for the Scottish Government insisted that teachers should be paid enough to live in modern classrooms.

He said: "We will ensure everyone with a degree from university works full time and enjoys decent pay. And we will also continue to work with the employers to ensure they put in place appropriate pay and conditions for their staff.

"We have identified a funding formula, which will provide a pay rise for teachers of between £7,000 and £7,500 a year,
