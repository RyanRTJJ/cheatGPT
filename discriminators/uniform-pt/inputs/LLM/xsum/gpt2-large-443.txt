", as many are calling it, had their name on the "List A" of businesses whose products should be subject to the new VAT laws.

It is the latest episode in a trend of growing support for what the government calls its "fairer" tax system over that which they say has been unfair. The government says that as soon as firms start selling goods without paying tax, any excess profits are liable to be deducted from a company's taxable profits, in effect handing a big windfall to the owners of these firms. The move has come under fire from Conservative ministers claiming that such tax avoidance is "evil" and is putting jobs at risk.

"For us, the tax experiment is very much a test of a political system which is about to be tested," said Lord Stevenson, a former senior adviser to the Cabinet Office, but who supports the reforms. "People need to understand that many of us are not just taking our money. We are taking tax."

The Government insists that the tax reforms will help companies reduce tax burdens, which are currently a major drag on businesses. In principle, firms can claim a flat rate of tax on their VAT sales before the additional charge is added for the government's new tax system, with the added burden borne by the consumer.

However, companies may be reluctant to pay any tax until they are sure they are not subject to the new levy, which applies to all goods and services purchased from companies doing business in the UK or its territories. Before that happens, the levy is likely to run to 6%. In addition, for many businesses selling beyond the UK's borders, the amount of VAT their purchases represent will be dependent on whether they are in Europe, meaning some of these profits will be subject to the new tax.

As well as being reluctant to pay tax until it is sure it is not liable to the new levy, firms are also likely to be reluctant to spend the time and effort it would take to register and claim the tax relief that goes with it.
