"The way I figured it," Mr Buffett said on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos, "is, I'm making a lot more money now than when I was in school and I was doing this thing.

"So, I think, at the end of the day, I'll pay some taxes just to be fair because I've worked hard my whole life to be successful, and I can't let her do that."

Mr Stephanopoulos said there was nothing wrong with a taxpayer who paid more tax in one year than the previous year when he was making more money. "I don't disagree with that," he said.

Mr Buffett has said he will not run for office after he was forced to forgo $1billion in annual profits from his company, Berkshire Hathaway.

Mr Buffett made the admission despite being paid roughly $60m (£47m) by the government to run the school system, the second most popular US public school in the country.

President Barack Obama has said repeatedly that millionaires, as well as the working and middle classes, take advantage of the tax system.

He accused Republican opponents of "biggest tax scam in 50 years" and Mr Buffett of "giving the Republicans an outcropping of a major point".

"This is a really complicated subject," Mr Buffett said. "I think it's going to take a long time before the people realise how important it is.

"The idea is just to make it easier for the people to understand things like that."

The "secret tax file"

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.

Mr Buffett said he did not feel threatened by an attempt by President Obama to shut down his company – or indeed, any attempt to punish him for his tax payments.

"There's one tax for the middle class and another for the super rich," Mr Buffett said. "That is the way it should be."

"It should be simple – you pay your fair share."
