 songs, albums, and radio stations and sharing via Twitter or Facebook. The service is in full launch mode but it's expected to gain additional features over the coming months and years, just as the free version did.

With the free trial, music lovers can listen to a sample playlist of tunes. When they purchase the subscription, they can listen to unlimited songs for two years and download a portion of those tunes. The tunes are also available for streaming on other devices, including Amazon's Fire TV and Fire TV Stick 4K. There's no catch with the free trial; it's available whether you're on iOS, Android, Amazon's Fire TV, and the Web. The subscription service will come out only on the Web, the company is promising, and will work both in the U.S. and on non-U.S. devices for most music genres, including pop and soul.

The announcement marks the second new release this year for Rhapsody, which also released a beta for Roku. The move shows that the company is focused on developing new services, not simply launching existing ones like Spotify and Apple Music. We have reached out to Rhapsody and will include any responses when we see them. We're now awaiting comment with the company's response about the service.
