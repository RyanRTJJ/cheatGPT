 that he and his wife were the only gay men among the hundreds of other boys who grew up there.

In the letter, he wrote: “When we were small, I remember a child on the playground, and it was impossible as we were so young for any of us to know or give the slightest intimation that he was homosexual and in the beginning, we only recognised his being different by his sexual orientation.”

He continued: “When we were older, he would look at me or speak to me and look puzzled as to where I came from or if I was from where. We often talked about our feelings, as we would look at each other and he would tell me how I looked. He said I was very nice. At one point, when I was about 15, he took me on his lap and we kissed. I remember I wasn’t wearing make-up at that time.”

Later in the letter, the man said he was “forced” to stop having sex with boys.

“I stopped having sex with anyone, even my husband who has been married for about 25 years and who has come out and told me he is homosexual. At the same time, I did everything I could to stop it, for fear of breaking the covenant with God and not being accepted by him,” he wrote.
He added: “It was the only way I could survive. I did all the tests I could to survive and we worked at it, we kept our faith as we moved closer to God.

“It hurt to know that we were in the minority but we accepted it.”

The man said that after he began to read about the gay rights movement and realised gay people existed, he said he felt “a little sad” but he went on to say “it changed after we left the home”.
