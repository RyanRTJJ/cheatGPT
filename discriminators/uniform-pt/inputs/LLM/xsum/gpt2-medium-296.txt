 spokesman for the deputy Liberal leader Richard Alston said Mr Andrews was concerned that Labour did not hold to their "common-sense compromise" with the Greens and was urging the parties to "re-examine how to get that agreement into law". Liberal Democrat trade spokesman Andrew Stephenson said the bill gave "extra clout and influence to the Labour party and to that side of politics" - something that was not acceptable on a number of issues. "This bill is not going to address the concerns of the Liberal Democrats and we will insist that it continues to be debated in parliament." Labour said the bill was wrong and damaging to the negotiations and said the government must move to guarantee a better deal for workers in future trade agreements.

Mr Andrews said: "The Government needs to give the Labor Party a chance. "They are right to oppose it with the support of the Greens and the Liberal Democrats because they should be offering the best possible deal to working families across Britain." The bill's passage follows a "good start" for the Government and the trade unions in negotiations with the European Commission. Under the current proposals, a minimum 50pc strike rate is needed and a third of staff must be unionised by 2020. Under the legislation, any employer who raises the price of its goods, including on pay and working conditions, when not supported by a contract will be required to pay compulsory arbitration, including a strike clause, in a dispute.

Mr Alston said it was a "big step forward" for workers to move their dispute to tribunals, meaning that the strike on 1 December would not be in breach of employment law and employers could challenge the rules if their contract was breached. Speaking today, Mr Andrews said he understood the unions that were backing the Coalition were not convinced by the bill of Labour's agreement on trade union rights. He said he had instructed ministers "to work with the unions" to push for the vote. He said the bill would offer protection
