 Stapleton is now facing a number of criminal charges over the company and also three charges related to the last year's losses on its mortgage portfolio. He could be sentenced to up to 4 months in jail under a scheme initiated by Mr Stapleton earlier this year, according to an affidavit last month by the Crown Prosecution Service.

He is said to be planning to re-enter the business following three years of rehabilitation, including the purchase during the time he spent in jail. The former CEO had been living in London where he had a business address on the south bank of the Thames in the years before the sale. The company says he and several others were a team player in the real estate market.

It also alleges that Mr Stapleton's partner is a former employee of British Airways, and that this relationship began in 1999 when Mr Stapleton bought the company from him for £20m. The money, it alleges, was passed along to Mr Stapleton's widow, Sophie, from some of her husband's relatives. It continues to allege that Ms Stapleton allegedly helped Mr Stapleton pay off two loans to finance his move to London on his own. Her money, which was allegedly used to buy a house for her wife, did not disappear into his personal pockets.

Mr Stapleton is charged with two offences and faces a total of seven years in jail. The company also accuses him of "disrupting investment through fraudulent or dishonesty of trade and asset transfers, failing to pay taxes or avoid tax, and failing to pay his taxes."

The government has charged a total of £1.1bn to compensate victims of Britain's worst banking crisis. The government has also made the case to the International Financial Fairness Commission that it should not provide money to victims.

The Government said the actions of Mr Stapleton and two other men should raise doubts in an appeal to the court of appeal that has been launched on behalf of the
