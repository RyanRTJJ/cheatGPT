ighshire, an English student at University of Leeds, was found dead in a field near the University's North West campus.

This second inquest follows a previous hearing held in September, at which time coroner Alan Walsh recorded that Pte James had been unlawfully killed due to the negligence of University personnel. He also said that it was not possible to give an inquest jury a true picture of what had happened on that fateful evening.

The University says they expect to be in court before February for a fresh inquest. According to the University's director of public affairs, Chris Poynor, it is "very likely that the inquest, when it eventually happens, will be more thorough than the September hearing. The University will also consider a referral to the Police to consider appropriate charging decisions."

In the wake of the suicide of PTE John Mackey in September, the University's new CEO, Richard Arnold, vowed to review the safety and security procedures in place across the wider University.

In a statement issued on 7 March, Arnold wrote: "While the police report does not suggest that John Mackey was the victim of an organised suicide attack or assault, we will review the security measures on our campuses – ensuring the safety and security of all our students and staff."

At the beginning of January, the Director General of the Council for Psychotherapy (CPG), Dr Jonathan Meiklejohn, wrote to Arnold, asking him to make this a top priority. CPG represents some of the country's largest psychiatrists, psychologists and hypnotherapists.

Meiklejohn, along with Dr Michael Dore, a leading psychotherapist and member of the advisory council of CPG, wrote to Arnold and the University's board outlining their concerns: "The CPG is extremely concerned that there is a gap between an official government review into suicide prevention, announced in November 2010, and the University's review in partnership with the University of Derby and North West University. There is also no official government guidance – a gap that the University appears to be seeking to exploit."
