Earlier, a Turkish foreign ministry spokesman said all migrants on board would face repatriation, which he said could bring them into the country in under a week.

However, the ministry denied that would happen, and confirmed that there would be no amnesty.

A huge influx of migrants heading for Europe has alarmed the EU.

More were expected to stream into Greece from the shores of northern Turkey.

Meanwhile, Germany opened its doors to hundreds of thousands of people yesterday - after the country also imposed tough measures to stop asylum seekers from making the journey.

Police in the southern city of Hamburg used dogs to search several hundred individuals who were reported to have broken into a mosque while inside.

A 17-year-old Somali boy was arrested in connection with the incident but he later left the country via another channel known for its porous borders that he had tried to use while escaping.

The asylum seekers were later allowed to leave the city and continue their journey in southern Germany.

The authorities said one suspected member of a gang of Somali youths who burst into a mosque in the east of the western city of Hanover was reportedly a 15-year-old.

It was not immediately clear why police had been searching for him.

German police are also investigating the theft of bicycles and other valuables from a migrant shelter in the eastern port city of Hamburg hours earlier, following the theft of 15 bikes by ten individuals who were later arrested.

Police said all of the stolen assets had been recovered, though police later said the total value of the damage had been far less than originally assumed.

Germany's interior minister also said that Berlin is in touch with the EU Commission to help devise a new legal framework to take back migrants who are not legal residents there.

"Germany is in touch with the European Commission today with the hope that this initiative becomes possible," Thomas de Maiziere said in Berlin.
