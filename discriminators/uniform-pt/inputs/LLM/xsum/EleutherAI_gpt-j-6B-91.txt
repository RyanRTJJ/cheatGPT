 below the national standard of 90 per cent.

NHS figures showed 90.9 per cent of people were seen within four hours – slightly above the national standard of 90 per cent. There were 5,823 A&E attendances and 1,067 patients were admitted.

A spokesman said: "While last week we set out a record number of new A&E referrals (43,543) and the second highest A&E annual attendance total achieved at QEUH, we are very disappointed that the performance has not improved from this historically high level.

"The 90.9 per cent A&E attendance rate, while in the top 70 per cent, is a significant drop and below the four-hour standard. This reflects a combination of too many patients – 4,000 extra patients at QEUH A&E compared to last year, along with a higher admission rate. We will work even harder to meet the four-hour standard in the coming year."

He added: "The NHS has a very large and complex organisation and performance can fluctuate from year to year due to a range of factors, including changing patient demand for healthcare services.

"On top of this, there is a lag between how a hospital performs over the course of a week and how it performs in an individual quarter, the impact of a very successful intervention, and how the performance of that activity is sustained over a longer term.

"As is often the case, our most recent performance figures for QEUH are an example of how NHS performance can fluctuate from month-to-month."

An urgent review is now planned within NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to look into how the hospital is performing.

In the first nine months of this year Glasgow had 5,809 new A&E patients and 3,188 were admitted, which was a similar proportion to 2014/15.
