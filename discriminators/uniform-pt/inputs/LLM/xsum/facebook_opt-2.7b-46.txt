It is important to me to be on court for the first time, to compete on behalf of the German Fed Cup team," said Gauff, who turned 15 on Saturday.

"I am looking forward to getting started with my career as a professional. I have grown up in Stuttgart and this is my favourite city. Stuttgart will always be my home. I am so excited about going back for the first time in my career so soon."

The former junior world number one will compete as an 18-year-old in the doubles alongside former world number one and doubles specialist Melanie Oudin.

"I am extremely proud of my German roots, especially after what I have come through over the past couple of years," said Gauff, who was coached by Michael Chang from 2006 until 2008. "Everyone in Germany knows how important tennis is to me and I am sure everyone in Stuttgart will be supporting me on Sunday afternoon."

Gauff, who broke into the world's top 30 rankings last year following her French Open qualification, will be playing her first-round tie with the help of her former coach Michael Chang and his son, Alex.

"It will not be easy to switch off from training for two days and concentrate on competing in the Fed Cup," said the teenager. "But if I get the chance to play on Sunday, I will be ready."

The US star will be supported on Sunday by the support of her parents, Candace and Corey; her trainer, Jim Morris; and her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou.

"The time has come for me to step up," said Gauff's coach, Mouratoglou, a six-time Grand Slam champion with his own French Open and Wimbledon titles among more than 300 wins on the ATP tour. "Emi has a huge future ahead of her and I am looking forward to seeing her progress and grow over the next couple of years."
