15m on tourist attractions, mostly the Caribbean and The Bahamas.

As the number of visitors to Scotland and England grew in both places, those travelling north of that border in the 2015-16 holiday season, according to figures provided by the Office for National Statistics, rose by almost 7% as a decline in visitor numbers, or 975,534, compared to a decrease of 636,534 in 2014-15, according to figures provided by the Office for National Statistics and published by The Guardian.

In total, an average of 4.2m visitors to Scotland went overseas, representing an average of 2.4m visitors per day and an average of 1.4m visitor per day in the whole of the last three months of 2015, the analysis said.

The number of people travelling in the three leading ways, including car, plane, plane-on-land, car-on-road and vehicle-on-land, grew 7.2% compared to the year to March, while the number travelling to The Bahamas increased by 6.6% - a 12.9% rise.

The most common source of travel expenses for all visitors to Scotland and England in 2015-16 was vehicle-on-land and the biggest decrease on last year was for the majority of car trips.

On top of the increase in travel expenses by car, many tourists would have liked to take a small walk or two on tour in Scotland, while people who used car or jet travel were still the most likely to be in the country. And, in the third quarter of 2015-16, an average of 17 per cent of the day's travel expenses could have left the country, compared to 19 per cent of the day's cost.

It was also the first time since 2008 that the first overseas visitor to Scotland for either of two years was ever counted as someone who got to England from there or Scotland from either of the two countries by crossing the Channel.

The number of overseas visits by visitors to Scotland in the year to March to 2015 were 7.2m and more than 13m, respectively. Of those 3m, 4.2m were from Spain, 6.0m from England, and 3.3m from Norway.
