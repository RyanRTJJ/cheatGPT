 in England in particular, it's more an issue of keeping the money involved rather than a case of high profile crime.

Police, though, will spend a greater share of their budget on fighting crimes. It's a key way the National Crime Agency (NCA) uses evidence to investigate suspected high-crime crime. When a case such as the "jail break-up" in Luton became public, NCA co-ordinator David O'Connell was told there were "two main issues that must be worked on, but one that must be worked on and solved". The second part of that would involve securing more evidence from the police. "If we've been held back to investigate it, that's that," O'Connell told In This Time We Trust. The idea was to tackle the problem through partnerships, and the NCA received one response: an anonymous letter informing them that their local police station had now been robbed.

A similar problem in the southern UK is the issue of keeping criminals out. Some people blame the police and what they see is a problem in "the media". However, there is a strong sense within the police that the government is behind the problems happening in their area, despite their efforts and money spent.

Some people feel a more cautious approach would be to spend more of the money on improving crime victims.

That may not be what the NCA is proposing, as the agency spends an estimated £2.5 billion a year on making crime stop. It says that will mean less than half of this money will be spent on crime prevention. However, it says that it is being
