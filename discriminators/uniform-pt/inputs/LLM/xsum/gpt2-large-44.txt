The company is already taking design samples from potential customers from BMW i, which is a brand new group of drivers, and that will be reflected in future models.

Another way BMW is going to make a difference is through innovation within its product range itself. This is what BMW is pioneering with a range of innovative battery technology, which is currently being optimised. In addition the company is making battery solutions available through battery suppliers that is offering BMW cars with a long warranty.
