The International Air Transport Association says many customers will need to return earlier than earlier planned or in more affected areas.

Airports around the country also experienced cancellations, with many canceled after 4 p.m.

The airports affected most by the cancellations are at Heathrow, Heathrow-Stanford (HGS), Gatwick-Chester (GCS), Halifax-St.John's (HHG) and Halifax-Guadalcanal (HHC).

All other affected airports are all south of the border, but the airlines have offered affected passengers alternative travel options.

In recent years, about 6,000 flights have gone over capacity at international airports. This morning, about 1,000 flights were on hold, due to cancellations, with 590 flights cancelled due to "inconsistencies in aircraft schedule," according to a statement sent out by British Airways.

Airbus of France is also working with carriers around the world to avoid these days long lines at its Montreal hub.

British Airways says this morning and evening, a surge of flights is possible.
