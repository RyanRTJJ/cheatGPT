 many to be a "slippery slope" for the crowd to come to their senses.

The match was rescheduled for this afternoon.

Celtic and Aberdeen remain three points adrift of the play-off places through a series of draws at Ewood Park this summer.

The United States and Scotland have won only once in their eight seasons at Hampden but the two sides continue to stand out as having the experience in a club that has a history of winning international players to their name.

Celtic are a hard-working side in the Championship, despite not being represented at the top level and being at the back-up to Everton, Everton, QPR and Fulham before coming through Celtic.

Barrichello - Celtic manager

He won the Glasgow European title with an historic Celtic side in the mid-90s and has said he was surprised by recent Celtic successes.

After a 2-1 defeat to Dundee United in the second round, in September 1996 against Dundee United Barrichello - and also to Celtic - told the Celtic faithful the club still had enough to win in front of thousands - the first time he's been sacked by the Celtic helm.

This isn't Barrichello's first attempt at promotion but the Scot also won the Edinburgh County League and then held the Championship title with the last match taking place at Celtic Park.

Celtic were top of the league five weeks ago last season, but Barrichello is desperate to prove he can win more trophies.

GOLDEST TEAM

Eddie Merckx - Celtic manager

The veteran Scot may no longer have the talent needed to win the Scottish Premiership but the 36-year-old has made it clear he does have a future.

With a record of five-1, Merckx took over from Gary Rowett as Celtic manager this summer.
