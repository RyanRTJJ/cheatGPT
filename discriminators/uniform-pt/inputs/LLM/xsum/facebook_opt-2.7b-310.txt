 not require any minimum spend.

However, Sainsbury's said that it had decided to cap the number of deliveries it was willing to send for free due to "uncertainty" among customers about whether they would be allowed to keep the savings they made with the service.

Customers in London and the south-east of England had also been able to request free delivery.

Sainsbury's said in a statement: "We have decided to reduce the number of free delivery S@D orders available to customers in the South East.

"We've found that some customers are unclear over whether our free delivery order option is an offer of free delivery for orders above a certain threshold.

"We believe that it would be unfair to ask customers to continue paying for an offer they don't understand.

"As such, all Sainsbury's orders over £20 will require a minimum spend from Friday, March 22, 2019."

Customers who are unhappy about the new approach can visit the Sainsbury's website to see if their local store still offers free delivery options.

Sainsbury's does offer free delivery to some customers in London and the south-east of England, although there are limits on when those customers can get the facility.

Customers in Scotland will also still be able to get free delivery, although Sainsbury's has stopped making the facility available to customers in central London.

How will free deliveries work now?

There are currently around two million items that deliver at least £20 worth of goods for free to customers in some postcodes for free delivery.

Customers in London and the south-east of England were asked to spend £20 or more at the time of signing up to the service, so that they could use the free delivery offer.

The minimum spend requirement is due to change on Friday, meaning the cost of an order could go up and customers may lose the free delivery option.

Customers who have been getting a free delivery service should be able to claim the savings on their account after Friday, once the spend requirement has been lifted.

There will still be a number of products that qualify for free delivery, including most alcohol,
