 policy, and asked for an up-or-down vote on whether to allow shale gas to be drilled and drilled in North Yorkshire within the county.

In a letter to the Scottish National Party, which backed Mr Murray, Friends of the Earth said: "The Scottish government's policy to limit the drilling by UK shale gas and to allow shale gas to be brought to the surface should be regarded as an important, but politically limited part of Scotland's development. This is particularly true in the wake of the announcement that the company will build an exploratory (non-fracking) pipeline to the UK from the Bakken well in Scottish waters at the border with England and the Isle of Man.

"This decision is likely to adversely impact community resilience to natural gas expansion, particularly after the launch of the E10 in 2013 as a key contributor to the Scottish economy and the Scottish independence movement. The Scottish government should not allow these developments to go ahead.

"In order to ensure the economic benefits of hydraulic fracturing are recognised, the Scottish government should not allow the production of shale gas from this well as this method cannot provide benefits for the community."

The SNP said it was "sad and heartless" to see North Yorkshire County Council block the proposal.

"The people of North Yorkshire are ready for action, while others need clarity on the long-term issues that are at stake," it said.

Dr Peter Sillars, the Scottish Natural Resources Minister, said: "As much as any minister or politician should not sit back and allow the development of these energy resources at the border of England and our continental shelf, the Scottish government is calling for calm, responsible action.

"If the Scottish government decides that fracking will be available for the rest of our country — and it's an area where there is no strong opposition — then North Yorkshire's natural resources should start to come under more scrutiny – even if it's not from fracking. This is the policy at stake in our region and it's time for all of us to stand up and oppose this plan until we get clear on why.

"We will ensure no one gets a pipeline which can't be used for a short amount of time.
