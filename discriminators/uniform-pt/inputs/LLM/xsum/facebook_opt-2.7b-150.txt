"Those who are attacking me have become cowards because they don't want to be held accountable," she said in a statement. "They know what I am capable of."

Mr Maduro's government has accused Mr Maduro's opponents of orchestrating a failed coup in which three people lost their lives. It also said the recent wave of violence was part of a plot to remove Mr Maduro, a socialist who has overseen a prolonged economic crisis.

Mr Maduro said a plan to "throw the opposition to the lions" had been foiled.

"They think that in their arrogance they will hide behind a woman... but the power of the people will never allow this," he said on state television.

The two dozen men charged on Thursday were all members of political party Popular Will, an umbrella group made up of four rival factions.

One of the men charged, Mr Julio Borges, said the charge was part of a deliberate strategy to destabilise the country.

"It is obvious that it is designed for people to break down and to become more vulnerable," Mr Borges said on television. "We are going to continue with a firm political stance and we are going to continue to work to overcome the economic crisis."

The opposition says the government is using the judicial system to crush dissent. It has long accused top members of Popular Will's leadership of being involved in human rights abuses, especially against activists and members of the opposition.

In early January, the government banned the political movement, and a number of Popular Will activists have been jailed.

Human Rights Watch called on President Trump and other international leaders to "use their influence to press the Maduro regime to stop persecuting political opponents".

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, has also said Venezuela was going through a "judicial crisis".

Mr Maduro said on Thursday he did not believe Mr Trump was part of a plot to oust him.

"He is a political person who has always been part of a plan against Venezuela," he said.
