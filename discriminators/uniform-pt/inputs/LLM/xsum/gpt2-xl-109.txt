Nassau director John Bicknell said: "There is significant improvement in the overall performance of HMP Exeter Prison and its associated housing projects, including significant reductions in inmate assaults and other serious assaults.

As a result the prison staff and management team are fully aware of the prison's security situation and have a comprehensive, well-coordinated crime prevention and protection programme in place to improve security.

HMP Exeter can hold up to 2,500 women and has more than 2,400 men.
