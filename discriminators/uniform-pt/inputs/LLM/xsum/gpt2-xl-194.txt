 the largest construction project in Birmingham's history - to have the complete planning process completed over the summer. The initial stage is a new single storey tower, with the rest of the new building - its ground floor - opening in phases.

The building is designed to combine flexible functions, with high quality materials and a 'clean slate' aesthetic. It is the first project by the new joint venture, which also houses the city's largest retailer, Poundstretcher. It will make the building more inviting to the general public, with more direct access to the river, a wide open lawn area and retail on the lower floor for the visitor.

St Nicholas House is the centrepiece of Birmingham's regeneration opportunities and is central to the Government's new strategy for the West Midlands.

The scheme's development has been led by TfL; together with its local partner, Oxford Street Group, and its developer Muse Developments, the project is a partnership between TfL, Oxford Street Group and Muse Developments. The architect is Foster + Partners with the construction managed by Balfour Beatty.
