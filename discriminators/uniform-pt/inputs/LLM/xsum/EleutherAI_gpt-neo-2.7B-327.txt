 Dr. Peter Loughlin, a four-year jail sentence over the case on Tuesday (Feb. 19).

Loughlin pleaded guilty to criminal charges in February, admitting he received $1 million in cash bribes for the promotion of GSK's diabetes drugs, Avandia and Diamla and its cholesterol drug Evoloc.

"While I am aware of the high standards and ethics that are expected of me, I also accept full responsibility for the improper behaviors and activities which have been identified by our independent forensic audit," Loughlin said, according to Reuters.

"I regret that I am atypical of the character of any person I have ever encountered and I offer my sincere apologies to anyone who has had to bear the burden of the loss of their confidence in me."

A total of $5.1 million was paid out to GSK over the course of the year, the company stated in a regulatory filing during the sentencing. $3.8 million was paid out directly by GSK to Loughlin and company employees for his drug promotion, while $1.7 million was paid out for travel expenses, and $600,000 was paid for GSK executives to participate in a drug promotion event that took place in New York City.

Loughlin was the head of GSK’s Chinese operations between 2003 and 2008 and oversaw more than 1,000 people.

Loughlin will serve as senior adviser to the company’s chairman, Richard D. Armitage.

Shares of GSK were down 0.8 percent in afternoon trading in London.

The company is the second major drug company to face allegations of bribery after GlaxoSmithKline agreed this year to pay nearly $400 million in fines to regulators over similar charges.

The UK's Department of Health is investigating the case, said a spokesperson in a statement to CNBC: "The Department of Health is investigating allegations concerning bribery allegations. As part of our investigations, the Department has launched a statutory inquiry and is seeking to interview witnesses."

CNBC's Kym Anderson was the first to report the bribery charges as well as the company's payment. She added: “We also expect GSK will soon issue an apology
