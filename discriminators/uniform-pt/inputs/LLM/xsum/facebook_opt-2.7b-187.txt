ler Higgs made his mark on the county game for Hampshire from 1999-03, winning the One Day trophies in 2002 before also representing England and England Women. He went on to make two years as the county captain but ended his playing career in 2004 after a knee injury sustained at Lord's. Higgs had recently been appointed a cricket coach and had already begun developing a new spin-bowling discipline, the "reverse-swing leg-break", which he said he would share with English batsmen. "It was a very tough few weeks on the cricket field, but I still felt I had a lot to give to the sport, and that I still had a lot to offer," the 45-year-old said in a statement which he posted on his website. "I felt I could still make the difference. I will be deeply disappointed in myself if I was part of the reason why this game became too important for me. "There's a lot of speculation over what the real cause of death may have been, but I've come to the realisation that it was because I knew I would leave too soon." Higgs is the third professional athlete to die prematurely over the past week. He follows the deaths of American sprinter Florence Griffith-Joyner and the American wrestler Pat Simmons, both in their 50s. The British athlete Stephen Twell, a former Paralympic basketball player, died in hospital last week after collapsing in a training session.
