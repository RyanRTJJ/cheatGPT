 switch diets for one week.

The same research is now underway, according to a statement from UNRWA.

One of the research's co-founders, Dr Martin J. Stuckmann, said: "This is important evidence that it's possible to decrease the risk to people with type 2 diabetes, which currently represents one of the biggest challenges in our quest."

His team, which is based in Johannesburg, was the first to show that a change in diet was associated with reduced mortality in African patients. One of the co-authors, Dr David J. Van Os, from the University of East Anglia, told The Independent: "Many people with type 2 diabetes need to eat more than 80 per cent less. It might not go unnoticed - it's a problem that's more common with low-fat diets and it might be more visible or it may not be completely clear which diet has the best chance of working. The results are the first of their kind so you should want to change your diet in the right way."

Dr Stuckmann described the study as a triumph for the scientific community "because it gives people a better understanding of what may be causing Type 2 diabetes".

"We're excited about this research and there are hundreds of international research organisations working to understand the causes of diabetes in their laboratories. The fact that the data from this study is out in the open will surely encourage more research in its field," he said.

In response to the scientific community's findings, a UNRWA spokesperson said: "We welcome and encourage the results of this new research and are pleased to know that it is gaining momentum and has helped to put this study front and center at the World Health Assembly. We've supported research into type 2 diabetes in developing countries across Africa and will continue to support efforts to make this disease even better by ensuring that the most recent study is carried out in a timely and relevant context."
