 details to deliver on all aspects, but we're working on it". One of the two proposed stations could be used as a new central airport terminal with a runway, while the other would be located between the city centre and A1A road.

The council said it was still seeking "further funding in partnership with other organisations to deliver this ambitious vision for Birmingham".

The two projects would be delivered over the next 20-years, with the council pledging a £150m in funding for its 20-year plan. "A new airport terminal could be opened by 2027 and the development could be delivered over 20 years with significant public sector investment," the council said in its announcement. "The rest of the investment will happen later."

The 20-year Birmingham Connected Rail project covers all of the city centre and aims to re-open some of the lines, including the line to Solihull and the Midland line from the city centre to Sparkbrook, which closed in 1990. It also proposes an extension of the route between Sparkbrook and the city centre along Bournville Road, as well as re-opening the route from Birmingham to Sparkbrook and the route from Sparkbrook to the city centre.

The council said it was also considering a future city centre development, with a new business district to be constructed behind the railway station, and a proposed £15m of public investment.



The council is now looking for the public to sign up to its plan for the city centre. To do this, it says that people must sign a public document, and that "if enough people don't take part, we can't deliver".
