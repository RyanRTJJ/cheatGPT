Catholics are excluded.

In addition the school’s staff provide the Catholic teaching to all students who attend. A representative sample of the pupils from all walks of life are targeted to ensure that all the pupils are exposed to the faith.

Other pupils benefit from a Christian education as well. Non-Christian pupils, however, benefit from a “positive Christian education” and the school has a “Christ is the Way” programme which teaches about Christianity and issues of a Christian lifestyle.

All children leaving school at the end of Year 7 are required to read and study a particular set of books. These include The Bible, History of the Church, Creation Science, The Rise of Christianity and a History of the Monarchy & the British Royal Family.

St Richard Gwyn provides three afternoons a week for each year 7, 8 and 9 pupil to attend an alternative programme in religious education. This is done without the use of a single Christian book. Instead the subjects are taught from the point of view of the history and beliefs of Muslims, Hindus, Jews and Bahais so that those pupils receiving a good education in other areas of the curriculum are well prepared to live in this secular society. There is an annual religious festival and Easter egg hunt.

Policies

A key policy is for all pupils to be involved in sport. At the middle and senior school, these are two half hours a week and one full hour at the end of each year.

There are three full days a week on which sports may take place. All schools are required to be affiliated to the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI) a Christian, non-government organisation which exists to support, enhance and promote Christian schools and to maintain the Christian character of all schools across the UK. It has membership from a wide range of Christian churches and represents all types of church and denominational schools in the UK.[5].

Religious education at GCSE, A level and Foundation Stage level is not compulsory. However the school encourages and promotes it. This is done through the religious festivals and
