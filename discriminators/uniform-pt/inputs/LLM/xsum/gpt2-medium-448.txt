 cross the Mediterranean to Italy.

The EU's humanitarian guidelines state it is possible some deaths could have been avoided if migrants who fail to arrive at ports on the way to Italy were held up by authorities who had been instructed by the Italian coast guard not to pick them up.

The guidelines also make it clear that an agreement is required before being able to repatriate lost and injured migrants, where there is no longer a legal agreement to the contrary.

The rules on repatriation of migrants arriving in Italy have not yet been formally updated to deal with refugees arriving on Europe, however an Australian official confirmed Australia would receive a referral to the European Commission if it became apparent any migrants were likely to die on the way to the EU.

The Guardian understands a referral would be made to the European Commission's internal market unit in Brussels, which is examining how Australia could help more effectively resolve the situation, in what is likely to be the first time the EU has taken such a step.

Australia is the largest contributor to helping refugees on the ground in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. But there have been concerns that Australia will not be able to provide logistical or other support to any country that takes in or is taking in refugees from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and Sudanese citizens seeking asylum in Italy.

Australian migration minister Scott Morrison last week said a failure to accept refugees who arrive at Italian ports would be seen as an embarrassment to Australia. "Australia has a particular responsibility of helping Syrian refugees find refugee homes in Australia, but of course that is not something we are going to do any of the time â€¦ We have a particular responsibility not to see people die."

The new EU guidelines have raised the prospect of more deaths from arriving migrants on the Mediterranean, where the majority come from conflicts in the Middle East, Africa and Asia
