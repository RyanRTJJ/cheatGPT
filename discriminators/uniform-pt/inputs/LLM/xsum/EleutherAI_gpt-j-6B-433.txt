hill, Adelaide. Just days later, her boyfriend, Thomas Leech, was committed to stand trial for her murder. He was found to have a history of domestic violence. She was the first woman killed during a period when women were legally entitled to an Order for Protection on being abused, even if no complaint was made to police.

Disclosures could be made to DV services on the DVDS website, by contacting the DV services directly, through a police station, or by contacting the local court or magistrate. Information in the DVDS was collected anonymously.

The following points are important to know about the process of disclosures:

A DVDS disclosure is valid regardless of whether a person was charged with a criminal offence.

The DVDS is the only means by which people can make contact with a DV service. The disclosure process does not give or provide legal assistance to the person making the disclosure, it is just a way to alert someone to a past history of domestic violence.

A person making a new DVDS disclosure must not be a police officer or a lawyer (but an officer may make a disclosure to a lawyer).

No-one made disclosures against any of the perpetrators listed on the DVDS for murders they committed. If you made a disclosure, and it resulted in a prosecution, then the outcome will be determined on the basis of the police investigation of the case, which is independent of information from the DVDS.

In June 2007, the first two persons were arrested for the murder of Margaret Quigley. Thomas Leech (the first person taken into custody in a police investigation) had two DVDS disclosures recorded against him â€“ both within weeks. He was charged with murder, and charged was committed for trial.

No-one who has made a disclosure is able to contact police or the DVDS service to have the disclosure removed or change the information that is recorded
