 has become little more than a slogan for the Conservatives, as MPs in the upper chamber have voted against triggering Article 50.

With a month to go before the vote, her official status remains unclear, particularly to May.

The prime minister has tried to spin her Brexit, and her attempts to sell it, to justify a move towards a hard border, a hard Brexit and tough immigration curbs. Such proposals would only appeal to an even wider and more reactionary section of the working class, she has insisted.

Her speech in Florence yesterday was notable for her unusual tone. "I have spoken with millions of Britons," she said, "and I have to say they think we're just going in the wrong direction today." She offered no plan on immigration. "We may be going in the wrong direction," she said. "We're not going to get that outcome because we don't know where it will take us."

She then said that, despite a desire to achieve independence for Scotland and Wales, her government had to be careful about that too. "We cannot be on this journey when, on matters of foreign policy and public safety, the UK is not fully sure about what is best for Britain."


This is her best public performance since launching her leadership bid last year; many of the people who spoke to her, it appeared, seemed to have seen through her carefully crafted PR. She has been much stronger in private than she has been in public in expressing her vision.

It is hard to know how hardbound her stance might have become if she had been running the government. Her Brexit team, it seems, have no interest in the consequences of the vote for their constituents, and instead are worried about the economic benefits from the departure of the pound; the economic pain it would cause if tariffs were lifted, and the effect on the housing market that could arise from the collapse of sterling.

She will be forced to confront many of these difficult issues if she is to remain in the White House. But it has been the voters who have told her that she has to find the courage to change direction, and they would hardly choose
