 eyes of the world, Australia is losing its way in dealing with the Syrian refugee issue. The Government could have given us a bit of a break and given a chance for a little respite.

The problem is what's happened so far. The refugees have been held for some time in the facility at the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). I know for a fact that there have been many, many delays. But they've been held, for a long time. What happens in a few days or a week goes very quickly. The refugees are now being moved to another facility.

That facility is now being used by a coalition of Australian and international aid workers, and the Australian Government. The refugees in fact are being placed before the courts. Australian court systems are not a good choice for dealing with refugees. In fact, there's no doubt that in some of the cases, the asylum seekers have been refused visas because they're people who are dangerous, in other cases they even committed violence and are even likely to do so even if given a visa. But the refugees are now being granted bridging visas, which is a kind of protection visa that's supposed to make it easier for people to go to another country, but in order to get that visa a person need only show some sort of documentary evidence that they will actually stay in the country and not go back after they've been granted another visa.
