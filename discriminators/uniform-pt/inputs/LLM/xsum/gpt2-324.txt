Ang Ilbo (JIL) website.


By last Thursday, the firm had sent over 900 phones in stock, some of them bearing the Note 7 logo, a statement by the firm said, as well as an ad. When some of the phones were left, one device caught fire and all five got charged under a similar circumstance.


The device apparently received the following warnings. "There is a significant risk to both users and property," an ad on the JoongAng Ilbo website read. Other information appears to confirm the threat, but it doesn't take into account the number of phones affected.


Although the note did not contain the word "phone", it appears the ad mentioned was written to lure users to the site, and later was removed by other advertisers.


It was not immediately clear on Friday what the "serious" threat was. But another ad of Note 7's bearing the slogan "Ace on fire!" appeared on another page, and its content was found on a mobile phone that had to be replaced by a Note 7 phone.


Two days later on Friday, the company filed a lawsuit before the court accusing Google of taking illegal steps against its users.


The case is expected to end up before a judge on July 12. The suit claims Google was liable for violating the law by "cannailing" Note 7.


"Google can be expected to defend the fact that the Note 7 infringes on all civil rights, including freedom of expression," said Dinesh S. Chaudhary, attorney at the firm of GÃ¼nter D. Shkobnik and Shlomo M. Zangak, former general counsel of Google who handled the JIL case. "The company clearly has the right to present its case successfully in the courts and it seems that the ruling could help to make an alternative defense in response."


The company has not officially confirmed the lawsuit. Google denies violating the law, and it recently hired an attorney for its case, while Google did not respond to requests for comment on the matter.


A note published late last month at the top of the JIL's product page included a link to a note titled "To the world's future, go without your note."
