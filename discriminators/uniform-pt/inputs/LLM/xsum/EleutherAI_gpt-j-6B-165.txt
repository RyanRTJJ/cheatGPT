 discovered a basket of everyday items would only set back a family £25 elsewhere on the coast than in Mallorca.

Research by the price comparison website also found the average family holiday at Port Aventura cost £1,600 in April 2008. This compares to just £600 in Ibiza in the same month and £100 on Majorca.

The study also found the number of days families spent in Port Aventura holiday resorts. On average they were spending a whopping 4.6 days during the summer.

The researchers say families can save a week's holiday if all three of them chose to stay in Port Aventura.

The biggest savings would be on transport fees, which, at more than 8% of the budget on average, is why Mallorca is the cheapest choice on our list, followed by Ibiza, Formentera and Majorca. But the study warns that this can't be relied upon.

"I don't think you can make a blanket statement over all of the island that a holiday costs that much, but on average in the summer, you are looking at a week's holiday at Port Aventura so you would easily save £600 that can be spent elsewhere," said Graham.

He added that the amount of savings you can make will depend on family size and transport costs.

He added: "Port Aventura have been trying to keep transport down but I believe they have been successful only because people take the bus and they don't have to have their own car.

He said other factors affecting holiday costs include children and whether families buy on package holidays.

"If families are booking their own accommodation and buying on packages, it will be quite a lot. For larger families, you can definitely save a lot. But I want to stress that it depends on how many of you are on a package holiday," said Graham.

"This is not something you should always stay on. If you are booking hotels and flights separately on flights.co.uk and your hotel, it really does save
