 effective, the device could be sold over the counter for just $10 on the premise that no one is embarrassed that they have high breath alcohol levels.

A device that could help people identify cancerous changes in their breath could also help doctors monitor people suffering from heart disease as they exercise or simply move around.

The device is actually powered by a battery, and it's not as hard-wired as a sensor placed against the tongue. Instead, scientists at Texas A&M University have created a tiny, lightweight device that fits into the mouth.

The device is small enough to fit inside the body like a pacemaker. And it contains tiny, powerful microphones. It also has a small battery that is placed in a cap.

These small microphones are being placed in people's bodies and captured in their breath.

At least 40 percent of people show symptoms of lung cancer, and it's the number-one cancer killer in the US. The disease kills two out of every five lung cancer patients.

But current doctors can not be sure it's cancer.

"Diagnosing lung cancer is difficult because the disease frequently occurs late in its progression," co-author David Dzau told Live Science. "For example, patients may actually have advanced lung pathology — as in Stage 4 — but if it's diagnosed early in the course of lung disease, there's a chance of cure. However, current diagnostic techniques simply do not distinguish early symptoms that indicate lung cancer from other health concerns."

Instead, to try and make it easier to diagnose lung cancer, researchers turned to the human breath. The team hopes to track the breath of people as they move around the house, to determine if they're feeling any changes in their airflow.

"People have been looking for clues to diagnose lung cancer since the research was published more than 20 years ago, and it's still going on today," Dzau said. [How to Spot Lung Cancer]

"The breath analysis is just another tool to
