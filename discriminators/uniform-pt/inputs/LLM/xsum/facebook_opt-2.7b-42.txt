A new portrait of Rembrandt, created by a computer, has caused controversy after being shown alongside a 16th-century watercolour of the Dutch painter in an exhibition at a Düsseldorf gallery.

With digital imaging now commonplace, artistic works are routinely re-created - so-called "dokumentation" - on huge screens. But while some see this as an increasingly important way of preserving art, it has led to accusations that the new portrait, which will be on permanent display at the Düsseldorf Kunsthalle until October, is too modern, modernist and too easy to see.

Experts said it was the first time the digital portrait, entitled Portrait of Rembrandt at the Düsseldorf Kunsthalle (Portrait of Rembrandt at the Düsseldorf Kunsthalle), had been displayed alongside a major work by the Dutch master.

“It is rather a strange coincidence that the two works should now appear in the same exhibition,” said Hendrik Pintsch, assistant professor at the Künstlerwissenschaftliche Technische Hochschule Hannover.

The portrait was created after existing works by the artist were analysed by a computer. A new work was then designed to look as much like a Rembrandt as possible - except that the hair was more realistic than the original portrait’s, created by an artist named Johannes Vermeer 150 years later.

The artist behind the new Rembrandt was not known, and the artist who created the Portrait of Rembrandt 150 years earlier was not named either, so it came down to which one looked the most realistic. The results were not exactly surprising: the image of Rembrandt as a young man was more like the real thing than the one of him as an old man, the artist said.

“What is most important, though, is that this picture has not been created with the new technology,” he said. “It is a picture of Rembrandt�
