 three goals for Leeds last weekend had been branded'shocking'.

The club has now confirmed the change has been officially granted by the Football Association and the players' shirts for Saturday's clash with Birmingham City will have the new design.

A club statement today read: 'Following a request for clarification made by the Premier League on Tuesday evening, following Leeds United's home shirt being changed to blue last week, the club can confirm Vincent Tan has given his final authority for the change to have come into effect.

Tan wants the Bluebird badge to be more prominent on the shirt

Cardiff City chairman Tan is an avid Cardiff City supporter

Cardiff City have confirmed to fans that Tan has granted their request

'Cardiff City would like to add it has not been an easy decision for us, nor one made lightly, but in the end, it has been made for the benefit of the club.

'It has been our firm belief from the outset that it is better for our fans to not have another team wearing the same jersey for the third year in a row, but we also need to consider the possibility that other teams, as well as our own, want that particular jersey. There will be a great deal of opposition to the change, but we believe it is in the best interests of the club.'
