 5.8% to £4.2bn. BBC director-general Tony Hall said the figures showed that BBC services were "performing really well".

But Sir Ian Livingstone, chief executive of the UK's biggest ad agency, Livingstone McQueen, said spending power was lower than it had been in "quite a time" on a number of key advertising targets.

He said: "The big growth driver in the UK advertising market was car sales through a number of years, that has been reduced significantly. I think what we are seeing more is actually more sophisticated advertising being run to attract people and their money to certain events like the Olympics."

He added that the media had grown in size and now played a far greater role in people's lives.

He added: "With digital platforms taking over, and mobile phones and apps proliferating, I think there will be a lot more sophisticated and sophisticated campaigns that will be created in the future. I think this will allow the media to grow, and it would be interesting to actually see what we are seeing with the Olympics whether that is a game changer."

Media agency Compellent said overall media and marketing spending growth was lower than expected, with advertising growth only 1% for the year, despite the Olympics.

However, it said the growth was mainly due to spending on digital technology as agencies moved away from print.

Spending on radio rose 4.3%, while spend on TV advertising grew 8.3%. Internet advertising - mostly online television - grew 25%.

TV advertising in the month of August was up by 5.5%, following an increase of 5.8% in July.

Spend on magazines was stable at £1.1bn in the year. Magazine revenue fell 6.8%, with a 1.2% drop in August.

BPI figures also showed that in August, £35.96bn was spent on digital technology, the latest data available.

The figures released by the music and technology trade body, the BPI, put the amount spent on all forms of entertainment and communications in August at £47.6bn. This is £1bn more than the £46.6bn spent in July.
