 the rest of his life has given me clarity in terms of my focus at the highest level," the 27-year-old said in a statement.

Murray has been training at club level in Surrey since returning from injury. He told BBC Radio 5 live's Victoria Derbyshire programme that: "It will be a really nice surprise to be going to a team, and it's great that I've finally figured out where to play. It's been my dream from the start and now I love playing for a team full of people I've grown up with that are there. That's great to become some people's team manager."

Last week, the American appeared on Sportsweek to discuss the importance of playing in the UK. "This is what sports are all about and you have so many things that you love about it that it's a great adventure to chase these things," he said at the time.

In the statement to The Independent, the tennis star thanked the support of the club, its staff and his players. He said: "It's been quite a rollercoaster week but my priority is to give my best to serve the team and my fans again and I'm glad to finally put my career in this context."

The Scot, 32, is currently the best-supported British player on tour, having won seven Grand Slam singles titles at No10 in addition to singles titles at Wimbledon and Australian Open. He was sixth in the 2007 British Open ranking after he beat world No5 Murray and fifth in 2013 following a 10-match losing streak.

His World No2 ranking has slipped, to No42 with eight straight losses at the Australian Open and with seven top-10s between July 2015 and a draw in Sydney in January 2016, with seven of his defeats coming after losing in the finals to eventual finalist Novak Djokovic.

"I love living and breathing and watching tennis," Murray said in a statement published on
