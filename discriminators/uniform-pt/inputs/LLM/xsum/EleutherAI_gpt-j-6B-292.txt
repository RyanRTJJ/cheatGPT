 some police stations across the region and, for example, at the town hall court in Southport. The scheme is being piloted by the North West Policing Board with assistance from police officers from the north-west.

A similar scheme was tested in South Yorkshire at a young offenders institution (YOI) which was not a success as offenders were reluctant to engage in the process.

At Manchester’s new Young Offender’s Institute (YOI) offenders are brought into a large room where they find an empty chair in which to sit. A video camera shows the offender and the victim. A young defendant and victim talk, with the option, where agreed, of seeing the other before they engage. A small number of cases have finished without resolution. In one case the victim saw the offender and then changed his mind about pursuing the case.

One of the key challenges in the future of restorative justice is that there needs to be a recognition among offenders, victims and the wider community that restorative justice is there to provide offenders not with a sentence but with a learning experience, with an opportunity to put right what has gone wrong. In this process, victims understand they can take pride in something positive coming out of the case. Also, it becomes clear there is a difference between justice and punishment.

A successful example of what can happen was the case of an offender who killed himself in custody after a dispute with a victim who refused to come to a sentencing hearing.

Other successes include an offender who said he acted differently after experiencing restorative justice. He was given support to address anger management issues, and he is considering a career in the justice system after his release from custody. Another offender now works in a factory. He has not been back to his home for two years but said he wanted to go back because he missed his family and the peace he found there.
