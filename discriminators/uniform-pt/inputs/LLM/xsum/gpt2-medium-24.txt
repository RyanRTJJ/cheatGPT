horrendous". However the BBC spoke to three teachers who said they hoped that the changes would ease their stress levels at their school.

One had been sacked after making comments about girls going into maths or studying to become doctors.

"If you listen to a few of their comments you can understand how they feel - this is what education is all about, to improve the lives of kids so we can make a few thousand extra pounds instead of paying them what they'd make at their place of work. They can't afford us what we can. You can understand, when you make those comments in a playground.

"If you want a better life for your kids then if they're thinking about going into that field or going to university you need to be prepared to put down a little bit of money."

Another teacher, whose daughter goes to a school called The Royal Palms in Salford, said: "My kids aren't scared. It's like being in a safe place. They don't need worry so why should we be concerned."

Some parents said the changes were "not enough" if they faced difficult decisions about sending their child to further learning before she turns 12.

Maggie King, 45, from Manchester, said: "Some kids have no place and they are pushed into doing better in some part of town.

"It's not like it is with a whole population. It would be nice if they were getting more money from us then and we could make sure that these changes were to make a difference."

A number of local authorities have made themselves a subject of ridicule for their decisions over what to do with their schools.

Salford made a choice between "scraping the government plan or throwing it away, or they will lose Â£80m by the time these children graduate" in 2010.

Some council workers were given "six-figure bonuses" while others were reduced to "dumps of blood" while their kids weren't going to good schools.

However the Department of Education recently announced that all such moves would need to come from local authority levels before they can take place.
