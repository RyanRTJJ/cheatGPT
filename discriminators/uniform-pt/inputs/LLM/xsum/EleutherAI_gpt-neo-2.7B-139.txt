 Romans, Byzantines, Aragonese, Arabs, Normans and the Spanish (mainly the Asturian, Castilian and Catalans) ever since the end of the Middle Ages. The Muslim conquest of Sicily and Corsica under Saladin in 1187 was a major turning point in the history of the island, as they took over Sicily and Corsica for the first time. The island is a very large portion of the Mediterranean Sea, making it the most densely populated region of the Mediterranean. Because of its location in south-eastern Europe, it has been one of the main areas for migration, trade and cultural interchange between the West and the East to this day.

Historically, it is believed that the earliest settlement and the first civilisation dates back to the end of the 4th millennium BC; around 3000 BC Greek settlers began to inhabit the island. The Greek colony of Naxos flourished first, but it did not develop a fully settled lifestyle until the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. The first settlement of the first city, Phocea, dates back to the early 2nd millennium BC.

The Greeks were succeeded by the Romans in the 4th or 3rd century BC, but the ancient city of Syracuse was founded in 264 BC. Around the age of the Roman empire, the town of Masseria was established. With the fall of the Roman empire, Sicily broke away from Rome and was conquered by the Eastern Roman or Byzantine empire in 568 AD. The name Italia was brought over by the Arabs in the 7th century, who settled the western part of the island. After this, the island came under the control of the Phoenicians under Carthaginian control. During the Spanish conquest, it was governed under the Phoenician empire, which lasted for many centuries, until the fall of Spain in the 14th century. During the 14th century and
