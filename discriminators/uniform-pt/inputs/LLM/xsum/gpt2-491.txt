's arm and did not hit either ground ball of D.C. United's back six with their last-minute free kick goal on July 5 against the Republic of Ireland in Holland, the England international was out, but he was available for the next two games against the New Zealanders and Ireland in New Zealand, and even came into the match scoring on Wednesday.

The second year England center is one of the best in the game, which is why it's surprising he's kept the top spot, but a key member of the squad for England has been his strong defensive output in the early going. He was an essential part of a side that dropped to 5-0-4-2 from a year ago with the help of Wayne Rooney and was among the best performers of the year when United scored the game winning goal in the 4-2 loss to Spain on April 21. He is also an integral part of a team that should be in contention for the FA Cup.

A man with some form in the midfield was one of the key players in their best game of the season against Scotland, and as he is the best in the game he should be an attractive candidate for a starting spot. However, the one man in the team who has proven to be one of the best in the game for England is Yaya Toure, who has played in all four of the team's qualifiers. His defensive form is very impressive and one of the most effective on-the-pitch attackers in the game but he's also a player whose game is likely to continue and there isn't one that should be a need for him on the field in the squad.

If he can add a solid defensive piece with some form and not let the team go to it's knees, then there is a chance that Toure could be one of the starting midfielders for England this
