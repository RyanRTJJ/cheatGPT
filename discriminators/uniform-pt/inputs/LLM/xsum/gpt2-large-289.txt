 not made any requests to be added, and the party invitation should not have been sent.

"It is inappropriate – it shows gross ignorance – and the person responsible cannot be supported, it is inappropriate and it is offensive to a lot of people," Mayor Jeff Berry said.

The council and the police would investigate the incident, Berry said, with the person responsible facing up to two years in jail and a $5,000 fine if he is convicted.

"I can't think of any other government in the country we would have to deal with this kind of thing," Berry said of the city's police department. "We're looking to the police for a criminal prosecution."

Berry said the city is working closely with its Social Services Division, a city agency that serves children in a number of different programs and needs, to develop a process to ensure the child and family are provided the care and support they need.

"When people have concerns, we should resolve them before we go forward with other things," he said.

A search of the address listed for the party invitation shows a woman by that name in 2015. On the page it lists for her the name of a man who owns a condo at 555 Main St., located on Main Street near Bayfront Parkway. City officials would not say which of the two addresses listed on the invitation was at the party.

It was unclear if the woman knew who the man was.

Court records show her name is Nancy Bailes, a divorced married mother of two who was arrested in September 2013 outside the First Niagara Center. City records said the charges included assault with an open container. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months of probation.

In 2013, records show Bailes, 50, made several unsuccessful attempts to adopt a child when trying to find one for herself. Court records show she first moved to Canada from the Bronx in October, 2016, and then to Canada again
