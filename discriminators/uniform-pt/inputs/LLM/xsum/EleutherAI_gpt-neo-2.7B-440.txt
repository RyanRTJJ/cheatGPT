The UK Government was trying to get out ahead of the Brexit deadline

It has been made clear that the UK Government is aiming to have a deal concluded by the end of October.

They have been trying to get out ahead of the Brexit deadline, trying to reach agreement with the EU by then, to avoid having to make a statement when the UK leaves.

The Prime Minister Theresa May and her ministers want parliament to endorse their deal by October 31st, but the MPs need to vote in favour and it needs the European Parliament to approve it.

There are now calls for a parliamentary vote on the deal, but a majority of MPs on both sides of the house have already rejected Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement.

However, an influential committee of MPs has produced a report stating that a deal based on Theresa May’s proposals won’t work and recommends an alternative, including a customs union.

But the UK Government have continued to push for a so-called “meaningful vote” or “consent” on the deal – which will give parliament a say on it – which was voted down by just five votes on Friday.
