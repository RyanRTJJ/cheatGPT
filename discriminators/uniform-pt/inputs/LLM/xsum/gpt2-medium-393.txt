 police stations, London police stations and Cardiff Metropolitan Police's RSLI station has run since 2013 to test how effective the use of mobile phones can be when used by police in emergency situations. The idea is to keep crime at bay.

The video uses the police CCTV to show thieves riding a bike on the road, and use these bikes to steal mobile phones during a pursuit. By running the video on the police station's CCTV network, the test helped police find where thieves might be.

"This is a case where mobile phones are being stolen after the police have taken their eyes off the road. Because it doesn't seem like so many of these robberies, in order to make the bike theft disappear, officers could be giving the offender a good scare. This is a test that has shown us they have got it right and the deterrent effect of a mobile phone is great", said Andy McCauley, Uplifting Police Response CSA. "The hope from this test shows how effective our bikes can be. This gives us the opportunity to build a relationship with people on bikes, helping identify who is a potential suspect and encourage them to alert the appropriate officers for help. If we can build strong relationships between officers and people on bikes we can give increased confidence and better services for both individuals".


Upsi also helped set up their own mobile phone crime initiative using Uplifting Bikes in London to test the effectiveness of different schemes in the capital. Uplifting Bikes are a community based scheme providing free phones to vulnerable groups of people, who have difficulty accessing phone assistance, by the Upright Citizens Brigade. The scheme provides hands-on support of 12% of victims. As part of their work over the past year, Upsi ran many trials, the key points being that they got mobile phone thieves to stay away from the bikes because they were giving them a good scare, and that mobile phones that used the Upright Citizens Brigade provided them with a much more stable network of access and that bikes were far safer than those given to officers by the police. Upsi has also provided free bikes
