 their case for the death penalty was excessive because a death sentence would encourage others to carry out terrorist attacks.

The sentences followed a ruling by a British judge at the end of January that said there was no evidence the three had any prior link to terrorism.

A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: "All three men were sentenced this week for offences in relation to terrorism.

A further seven gang members involved in the alleged plot to kill a British soldier using a rented van were found dead in a car park and a fourth died in another violent death.
