"London is a world-class city, with first-class transport. But there's been a long history of anti-smuggling, and that has had a real impact on our transport security," he said.

Tottenham MP David Lammy praised the mayor, saying he was doing a "spectacular job" in implementing new proposals to tackle the problems caused by people trafficking and modern slavery.

"This announcement is a step in the right direction," said Mr Lammy.

He told CNN: "One of the best things for trafficking, modern slavery and human trafficking is actually bringing in more police.

"We are very pleased that Boris Johnson is taking this important step to help people who are coming into this country and into our country to become part of the fabric of our society."

At the same time, a new task force to examine the challenges caused by trafficking was established by London mayor Boris Johnson as part of his national leadership "to take action on a new and vital agenda of tackling modern slavery".

'Pitiful response'

Mr Khan said the mayor had done a "spectacular job in addressing the issues of the past and of moving forward".

And he said the mayor had a "good track record" of tackling anti-social behaviour and preventing criminals from coming into the capital, saying: "Boris has built a fantastic reputation by taking bold decisions and addressing difficult issues".

Mr Johnson's response to the problem came amid criticism from Labour, the largest party in parliament and a long-time critic of the mayor's.

Leader Jeremy Corbyn said a London Mayor, appointed by the mayor of London, "should never stand for a second term".

He also said Mr Khan should have a chance to respond to the plans, before the mayor's announcement.
