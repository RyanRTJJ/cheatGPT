 test would end to see if the company would meet basic requirements of aviation safety.

After some legal wrangling, and after Boeing refused to make the test a requirement later, the FAA released a preliminary regulatory status report this morning that outlined what the test actually revealed, what problems it uncovered, how it might be used to target unmanned aircraft, and what the possible consequences might be.

"All this is important because, at the risk of sounding like a bunch of pricks, we're going to need better science and technology to fly commercial airplanes, just like on our previous commercial aircraft," Boeing Chief Executive Martin Dennis told reporters outside the FAA's offices in Washington.

The company, which has faced criticism over its role in a pilot and flight-causing crash in 2013, has already been in the news recently for its failure to keep its own data record.

Boeing is currently in the middle of a lawsuit over $7 billion in wrongful dismissal claims from six former pilots who were fired in the 2010 crash of a commercial airliner after an autopilot failed. Last week, a Federal Aviation Administration review panel found the FAA was overstepping its authority and denied the company a permit to test its unmanned aircraft in flight.

In addition to the pilot, the company plans to meet with ULA International next month, ULA chief executive David Gomberg said in a statement. Gomberg declined to elaborate on the meeting, but said the company is "very excited" about it, noting that its pilot meeting is "another part of our partnership with the FAA to take aviation to the next level where they can take your safety and safety into account in every aspect."

Boeing also has been flying autopilot at a handful of other public airports, with more, as we've known them to date, as well as flying the drones in international airports like Tokyo and Singapore.

The FAA did say last year it wasn't considering using drones in any
