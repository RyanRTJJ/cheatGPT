Poland plans trials over corruption probes

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists says that six other officials, four of them ministers, have been charged in connection with the scandal and could be sent to trial in Brussels or Strasbourg.

Poland was rocked by revelations at the weekend of widespread corruption in the public administration in the former communist country.

The country's former prime minister, now president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, was charged in the case and denied the allegations, which he said were politically motivated.

Two former prosecutors with expertise in the country's corruption scandal are being investigated by prosecutors in Brussels and the European Commission.

Euronews quotes one of their lawyers as saying that an investigation was already under way in December.

"Both the two cases were handed to prosecutors with the aim to find out the truth," the lawyer stated.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reports that the European Anti-Corruption Action Centre (OLAC) says that at least 36 officials and lobbyists have been prosecuted or detained by their fellow politicians since 2009.

Poland has been repeatedly criticised for being among the most corrupt countries in the world.

Prime Minister Beata Szydło has faced repeated claims of misuse of money and influence.

In 2011, prosecutors said she had used the country's money to buy a home with her boyfriend, buying a €3.5 million ($4.6 million) house in one of Poland's exclusive suburbs, where it has been reported her family has been making investments.

Police launched an investigation on the same day of the report in a number of media outlets that she had failed to report £9.5m ($14.1 million) in income since 2010, when she was finance minister.

The Polish foreign ministry said on Sunday that the prime minister was being investigated for abuse of public office and that she would remain as finance minister until a trial has been completed.

Polish police have also said they are investigating whether a member of Szydło's cabinet illegally got funds from construction firms to promote projects before she came to power.

The charges include fraud, embezzlement and public conflict of interest.
