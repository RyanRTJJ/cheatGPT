-husband, Philip, has admitted murdering his ex-wife and has promised to pay £1.3m to her estate if she does not come clean.

Mr Proctor, 46, who has a history of mental health issues, admitted the couple took advantage of poor care in the home after a few years on council – after his ex-wife was diagnosed with bipolar disorder – and had been forced to leave her.

He also admitted killing his ex wife in 2010, when he was 19 years old, on a street in Luton after he fell pregnant with his wife's son.

In a statement he said: "I have now been given a life sentence and my crimes against humanity are deeply reprehensible.

"My actions at this time were to commit my crimes so that I did not have a child, to save my wife from danger to another woman and to help her get back where she left her past and life."

The couple's relationship turned sour and as a result, Philip, who admitted killing his partner, was stripped of his position.

They had two children, aged 9 and 13- while he took his wife. He told the inquest Mr Proctor had a "mental illness that was very likely contributing" to their divorce.

His wife received hospital treatment in the summer but he was unable to return to work as he took his time home, his family said.

Amber Rudd – the widow of former Tory Labour MP Peter Blunkett – said this despite finding an "incredible breach" in the separation system.

She said: "Her allegations made to me of having committed 'brutal torture', including putting the child in the arms of strangers for six months while she was in distress caused great distress and hurt the whole family.

"His actions were consistent with abuse of power, which is in my view the case at hand and further evidence I need to establish, and there does seem to have been a breach where he has taken away his right to practise law when he was forced by his boss to give advice in return for his job being'more lucrative'.
