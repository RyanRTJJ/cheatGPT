 Paul, who recently took the reins of the Royal Artillery in Canada, won the crown without suffering injuries. He was also on home soil. He's not just about being part of Royal Artillery but his participation in battles. "I hope to have a little moment in the history books here in Canada as a soldier," said Rose. "It's amazing to see so much passion. I'll be a bit sad, a little sad when we have to miss him."

It's something many Canadians consider their privilege when it comes to a great battle. At a time of peace, they come in all different colours, shapes and sizes, and every soldier feels at home with one.

"A guy like Mark of the Fox didn't do it with a sword. He didn't do it with a katana," said a soldier. "My first officer didn't do it with a sword. He just went out there and saw a war and said, 'I have that.' I said, 'Well, I know that."

This is one of a group of soldiers from a variety of disciplines – from soldiers for Royal Armorer and Royal Guards, to soldiers to Royal Engineers." These are great guys that we've seen throughout the whole country," said Rose.

The young soldier has fought in almost every battle including Canadian-style battles at Vimy Ridge, Edmonton's Fort Bliss, Sarnia Barracks, and various reserve forces. He's also been named an Army Medal of Honor Master Sergeant, a Bronze Star and a World War II Memorial Medal.

Rose was at the Venerable John Korsch-Virgil Memorial before the Venerable John Korsch Memorial. They said, "I'm looking forward to spending time in your arms and coming down to meet you at home."

When he gets a chance, Rose said, "I'll be a bit of a walkin' man." He's not just a hero. He's also an officer – who cares that he's being rewarded by the support of the Royal Army for what he's done.
