Namibian lightweight Namibian veteran Indongo had been in fine form, taking his perfect record to 21-0 with 15 knockouts.

But in front of a boisterous crowd, Crawford was never under threat and took a wide decision win.

"I have watched some of Jeff's fights and he was in with some of the best guys in the division," said 34-year-old Crawford.

"I was prepared and I was ready, he was the favourite and even more so from a height point of view, but I was ready to show what I can do.

"I was able to use my hands well, I'm very happy to win the championship."

Crawford's manager Mick Hennessy said Indongo had been the victim of a "faulty analysis" which showed him in too aggressive a frame of mind.

He said the US "super" champion was "overconfident".

"He was on his toes, overconfident that his timing would prevail," said Hennessy.

"This is a real learning experience for him."

Namibian Sports Commission president David Mabumba said he was happy with the outcome but said he believed Indongo had not really been in contention against a man with a very good record.

"It doesn't take into consideration his record. He has fought well but it is not going to change anything," he said.

"We were there in the corner watching the fight. We are not happy."

After fighting in the United States for most of the last four years, Indongo returned home recently and fought in his first major title fight.

In the wake of the defeat, Indongo apologised to Crawford.

"I'm sorry to the boxing world," he told the AFP news agency.

"I've let them down. I really should have won. It was a great opportunity to win a world title.

"I'm disappointed about the outcome. I'll be back stronger."
