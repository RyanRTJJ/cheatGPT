 sleeves, trousers, or jeans.

Women were cautioned to refrain from wearing make-up and jewellery, or having their hair washed, cut, coloured, plaited or styled. A ban on hair extensions was issued.

“I don’t want to get it, I just want to know what’s going on,” said a woman who, like many at the march, was only able to reach it through a security checkpoint around the corner on Trafalgar Square which was not attended by the Police.

“They are going to ruin our clothes, our lives,” she said. “I don’t want to spend the rest of my life dressing like a schoolgirl and going about. I was thinking about getting it done, but I would love to keep it natural now.”

Others said the ban was needed to protect women, who are targeted in sexual assault by groups campaigning for the vote for their male opponents. An increasing number have been arrested in recent days on the campaign trail for wearing short skirts or, now, “slutty, loose dresses”.

Earlier this month, a woman who was wearing a “slutty, loose dress” was raped in a London subway car by an anti-Brexit protester who said he was there “for my country”. The attack was not captured on video.

“The ban doesn’t make women feel any better, we are just being blamed for being dressed like sluts,” said another witness.

“I wear these skimpy clothes all the time, they think women should be under there. We are the majority, it’s the way we are,” said Sarah.

“Don’t blame me for being able to afford a decent outfit and have a comfortable life,” she added.

Many women at the march felt the ban is an invasion of their privacy.

“It has been on my mind since yesterday and I have had to change my route,” a mother said, walking beside young schoolchildren, “I don’t want to ruin their day.”
