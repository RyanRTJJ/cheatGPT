 Royal Astronomical Society to see whether it would be worth £500,000. It finally was donated back to us. There are currently 17,000 people living in the UK who have discovered this piece.

The meteorite weighs up at more than 20 lb (12 kg).

The Apollo 14 moon rock from the American astronaut John Young is valued at about £1,200,000 (approx€1 million) each now

In 2003, it came back to England for conservation purposes, but was returned to space to be stored at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in the late 1980s.

The rock was the first piece on Earth retrieved from moon rocks in 1969, but is still the only original one, with only the ashes of Apollo 14 surviving.

In 1976, the Apollo 14 moon rock was sent to the National Museum of Wales to be displayed

This year, it is being exhibited, along with several moon samples from the 1970s and 1960s, when the astronauts explored the moon.

Some of the objects are being donated to museums around the world.

However, some are in peril, being shipped from the Apollo 11 base back to earth. In November 2011, the International Space Station exploded on re-entry around 3am local time in Low Earth Orbit, with debris falling into the bay behind the orbital outpost in low Earth orbit.

The site of the moon landing site, in Pennsylvania, has been declared a "high risk space hazard", with the potential danger to the International Space Station, according to a
