, works hand in hand with the Ministry of Defence to support people after an attack.

One of the hubs is named in honor of Prince Charles who is a member, and regularly visits an after-hours emergency team.

On 26 February, members of the Royal British Legion were on duty in central Manchester when Abedi detonated an explosive belt while wearing a hood.

Another hub is named in the memory of Royal Navy ship Commander Charles "Sandy" Harris and is a "lifeboat" meant for a ship that is losing power or has its engines disabled or in distress.

The ship is not manned but the Navy keeps watch aboard and provides the services it should, such as providing care to stricken sailors, according to an MoD spokesman.

Royal Navy Captain Kevin King told CNN that his crew are constantly on alert and help is coming in from all over the world â€“ from the Falkland Islands to Afghanistan.

"As we know there's an attack in London," he said. "As we know that there are multiple attacks in this city at this time, we are very aware that our colleagues in London are also on the watch."

Abedi became the first suicide bomber to strike outside the United Kingdom when he rammed a vehicle into a crowd celebrating Ariana Grande's concert at Manchester Arena.

Hundreds of people were injured in Wednesday night's attack and at least 22 people were killed.
