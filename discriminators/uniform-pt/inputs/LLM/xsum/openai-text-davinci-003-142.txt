and the first since Jo Durie in 1983 to win a singles title.

Watson started the week ranked 61st and has climbed 23 places thanks to her victory.

The 24-year-old from Hampshire won her first tour title in Osaka in March 2012, a victory which helped launch her career and propelled her into the top 50 for the first time.

Watson, who beat no.2 seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia in the final, is now well-positioned to qualify for the WTA Championships in Singapore in October.
