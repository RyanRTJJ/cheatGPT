 most of it on a bus service.

The doll was launched by an army of toy soldiers on the first ever bus service in 1956. A total of 6,000 dolls had been sent on the service, with another 2,000 on a tour of the south coast.

The original toy soldiers launched the new character 20 years later, becoming household names.

The toy soldier company have also sent the “original” figure to The Duke of Cambridge for the 50th anniversary celebrations.

The Duchess of Cambridge had spoken of her love of the toy to The Independent in 2016.

“I love it, it’s brilliant. I still play with mine,” she said.

“I remember them from the age of four and five. I’m so impressed by it. I was so excited when I got my first one for present and I still am now that it’s in circulation again. It has a little military theme about it, which I love.

The Duke of Cambridge is launching Action Man in London on Sunday. The duke is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the toy’s birth.

“It was something I could play with and do all sorts of things with, and still do with now. I’m going to see the action man exhibit again because it’s been out for a few years now and it’s the best ever.”

A number of celebrities are expected to attend the launch, along with more than 1,000 volunteers from across the nation who will play, sing and march their part in re-enacting the 1956 launch.

The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess of Wessex, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s sister, Pippa Matthews, and The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall, will be on hand to speak at the unveiling of an Action Man statue outside the Globe Theatre.

The London exhibition is being launched at the Old Vic theatre with the support of a grant from the Culture Recovery Fund’s £1.57 billion pot of money for arts and culture across England.
