 were sold, compared with 28,934 for the same period in 2016.

"This is the highest annual rise since April 2014, when we recorded 31,010 sales," said Neil Buchanan, RoS's head of sales. "This was driven by a rise in the number of single detached dwellings selling in Scotland for the first time since December 2016.

"The recent increase in the number of sales has coincided with the release of the new Building Survey, which offers insights into the housing industry across Scotland and shows there is a strong foundation in place in terms of the growth that is taking place."

The number of properties under-occupying in Scotland rose 15% in December, compared with November, while the number of properties that are vacant fell 14%, marking the first fall in vacant properties in six months. "This continues to be a challenging time for the construction industry," added Buchanan.

Selling prices on individual properties vary, with both the monthly and annual averages for sales currently slightly above their respective November 2016 levels. "The price rise is continuing around the country, although particularly consistent in the north of Scotland following the recent sales trends which have been in place for some time," said Buchanan.

The RoS figures are a mix of houses sold and apartments, with 1,037 properties sold in December and the same number under-occupied (1,619).

A spokesperson for the Scottish government said: "After a year of falling mortgage rates and rising house prices, household debt has reached its highest level since 2007.

"But despite this, Scotland remains one of the fastest growing areas of the UK economy. This has been supported by higher wages and increased income for people working across the country. Scottish Government has announced investment on housing and the economy through a new UK Growth Fund that will help to spur growth and create jobs."
