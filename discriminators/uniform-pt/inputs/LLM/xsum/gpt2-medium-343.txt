 he has not voted there since 2001

"I've seen him twice and I've seen him more recently - during the run-up to the referendum, and I would say that would indicate he is definitely campaigning on a 'yes' vote, yesterday after all of this happened.

"The issue I've raised is very difficult for me to hear - I want David Davies to be elected to be Welsh First Minister. There is an argument that someone like David Davies is very much in opposition, I don't think this goes far enough.

"I am really, really disappointed the Welsh Labour Party, in particular Ken Livingstone, the main Labour figure this election, has allowed such blatant conflict of interest to go on."

Livingstone became leader of the Welsh Labour Party in September last year - he is the party's co-author of its manifesto but is not listed in any of the party's local members' lists.

Theresa Villiers' husband, a former senior Welsh Government minister, is among the names on the list of party officials who are on the board of directors for Mr Villiers & Associates.

The chairman of the company is Mr Davis; the chief executive chairman is Mr Tewfik Smith; and the UK Director works for Ms Livingstone. Her name is also listed as director of one of the company's subsidiaries.

But the company is still registered as a lobbying firm, and one of the firm's clients was Mr Livingstone's law firm King's Counsel.

It is not clear whether the legal arrangements - the Welsh Conservatives do not have a separate board - could fall foul of regulations, nor what action is expected now the EU referendum campaign closes in mid-June.

Mr Davies is to take a Leave campaign position by returning MP on 5 September, and then a Remain position on 5 and 6 September.

There are also fears Labour's leadership election to replace leader Harriet Harman is also being held.
