 held a news conference to discuss issues of public concern, and a number of political battles, which are being fought in the Assembly during the Assembly term.

The Assembly’s annual Environment Day debate on 29th January followed the opening address by Alastair McDonnell, and concluded at 11.30am with questions for the Minister. McDevitt, who has been a member of the Assembly since 1974, presented the day’s theme, ‘How will we ensure that every Irishman has a stake in the success of a new Ireland?’ and was asked about Northern Ireland's role in the new Northern Ireland settlement. Conall McDevitt commented on the issues faced by communities in South Belfast, and asked what the current state of the economy in the region means today.

Alex Attwood, who has been an MLA for the South Armagh constituency for more than 25 years, talked about his role as environment minister. He welcomed the Assembly’s decision to move the Environment Day debate to the opening of the Assembly, and also noted that the day’s main event focused largely on Stormont’s ‘out of session’ status.

Patsy McGlone, who was born in Ballymena, then in South Belfast, and has represented the constituency since 1973, also spoke in support of the move to move Environment Day to the opening of the assembly. Speaking of his role as environment minister she told the MLAs that she does not often like to make speeches in the Assembly, but she felt that “if we stay long enough… it will be very interesting.” On the issue of Northern Ireland’s role in the Assembly, Patsy McGlone said that the Assembly was “not an unselfish body”. She noted that the Assembly needs a Northern Ireland Environment Minister “but we have not yet got one.”

The opening debate centred on the Stormont/Executive Assembly to ensure that it had a strong Environment Committee and strong Environment and Communications Committee.
