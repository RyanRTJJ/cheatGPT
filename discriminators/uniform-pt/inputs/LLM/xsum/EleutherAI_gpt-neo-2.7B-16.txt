 their feet to give them a little control.

The bike pedals were, in fact, a very effective means of keeping the students seated during class.

They worked so well because the students were so young. The children were four and five years-old when Mrs Lambeth worked with them — too young in her mind, she says, to sit still. "We just thought it would be too much work for them and they could take it in their stride. And every morning when we would put them on bikes, they would just fall off the other side."

The young children could not help but move around to keep up, although they could be trained — the pedalling helped them to learn to sit still. But even this small demonstration of a kind of learning that seems innate is not a solution for the great amount of learning that is going on with our kids these days: one third of all American 4-year-olds are either in special education or preschool. Many are home schooled and many continue their education at public schools where the learning in large part depends on moving around, on using their bodies as vehicles for processing information rather than on doing what they are told. In other words, there is always more opportunity to be learning around them, not just during the physical activity, but in physical activity itself – even though physical activity is not always fun for kids. That's why parents, teachers and politicians want to know what works, and where, and why, they can take the power to direct this activity to make learning happen in a new way.

There is, of course, a big difference between the way we thought kids learnt in the past, and the way we think of learning these days. The traditional ways of learning, and of teaching, that we all learned in school, like sitting still and listening to a teacher, are no longer necessary (unless your memory is going). Today's schoolkids, some of whom have just learned to walk the second time, and to say their ABC's, can walk and chat,
