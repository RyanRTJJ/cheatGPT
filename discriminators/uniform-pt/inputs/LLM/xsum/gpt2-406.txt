 son was abducted with McAlroy in September 2003, denied the killing with the family saying they had no other leads.

McAlroy told the court at the time he had wanted to live alone and had been trying to get a new house.

The Crown said: "I had some time to think about what had happened to my boy before he became one of the most wanted children I had ever seen and about what his future could be."

The court heard Gage was a devout Catholic with a long beard and two tattoos. He was married to his wife of 12 years, Patricia in November 2007 and had two children, aged two and 20.

McAlroy told the court: "I had nothing in common with him. They both had a child. They got married and he has two other children."

The Crown said he had been an alcoholic in recent years since he returned from being abducted 12 months ago by security forces at a nearby beach resort.

As a result, he was found in the desert by a third party. One of the suspects had apparently been a member of the gang known as the "Pirates of America".

The Crown said it would not charge Gage for the kidnapping.

Judge David Kellett said: "It is clear from the evidence from the three people who have been accused that the accused knew or should have known about the abduction. From the testimony at trial it is clear that they could never have known about it otherwise.

"There is, therefore, no excuse whatsoever for the person who assaulted the innocent man to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time."

He added that no charges would be laid at trial.

The judge said the two men had "no apparent connection". The jury will be asked to consider the three remaining witnesses, one from Scotland.

It comes after a string of failed attempts by the South Lanarkshire police and other law enforcement agencies to identify the suspects by the identities of their victims.

The family say they lost their son with the abductor in a car park early Sunday morning. The father has never been charged
