 mild illness in most cases, causing only fever. However, women who are pregnant can pass the virus on to their developing unborn babies. They include:

women who have been bitten by an infected mosquito

a woman who has a miscarriage

a pregnant woman who has contracted Zika from a mosquito bite during a travel to the Zika zone

A US citizen and her family had to make the difficult decision regarding whether to cancel a trip to Miami when the first case of the Zika virus was reported this month. A pregnant woman who had been infected after an extended stay in Dallas was advised to deliver her baby at home. The child will likely have been born with congenital microcephaly â€“ an abnormally small head and brain.

So far there has only been one confirmed case of the virus in a Canadian tourist. There is no evidence that mosquitoes in Canada are spreading the virus, but an earlier outbreak did result in one case of microcephaly in a child born in Quebec.

"The risk of mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission remains low across Canada," says the CDC's statement. "We expect the risk of transmission to vary geographically since different mosquito species and environmental conditions can affect vector survival." It advises people to practice safe sex, practice safer sex practices, avoid mosquito bites and take steps to protect yourself from being bitten by an infected wild animal that may be carrying the virus.

Dr. Ian Lipkin, a microbiologist at Columbia University and president of Doctors without Borders, says the CDC is very correct to note the risk. A pregnant woman who has Zika should avoid travel to affected areas. But Lipkin questions how effective such precautions can be without an effective vaccine.

The US has been trying to develop a Zika vaccination since 2015 but progress has been slow. Lipkin says it is "imperative that the vaccine gets approved as soon as possible." It's likely to be a decade or more before such a vaccine is available to make people safe from infections from the infected male virus.

"We're going to be at this forever, but at least until we have a vaccine and we have it working we can take some general steps,"
