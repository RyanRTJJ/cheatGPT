"BT has a strong focus on delivering a positive and profitable outcome for its customers and it is pleased that the advertising revenue for 2016 has seen continued improvement, supported by strong performance on digital advertising," said Greg Clarke, BT chief commercial officer.

"It is very pleased that BT has been able to continue to deliver significant returns to shareholders in 2016," Mr Clarke added.

BT also said it sold digital ads through its app for its services in more than 40 international markets with no impact on its UK revenues. It also sold a further seven markets in 2015.

"Advertising is a key revenue stream for both the company and its shareholders and BT is determined to deliver for its customers," said Greg Clarke, chief commercial officer for BT.

BT said it sold £2.9bn worth of digital adverts in 2016, an increase of 30% on 2015 figures, with digital ad spending rising 8% to reach £3.2bn.

Total advertising revenue in 2016 increased 6.5% to £5.6bn, the highest level since BT's formation in 1997.

Digital advertising, which is still a significant segment, increased by 6.3% to reach £2.34bn.

BT said there was a wide range of different opportunities for growth in 2016, with opportunities in digital media, technology and gaming across a number of key areas – including, for example, its portfolio of interactive TV.

The company said it expected 2016 advertising ad revenue to grow alongside or in parallel to the growth in digital ad spend.
