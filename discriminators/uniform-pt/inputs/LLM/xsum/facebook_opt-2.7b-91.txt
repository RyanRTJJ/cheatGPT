 figures for the second week of the quarter had been worse than in other hospitals.

A report entitled ‘A Critical Appraisal: the Health of the NHS in Scotland’ said the figures had shown a 4.5 per cent fall between January 17 and 22. The report also said the percentage of patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency was up to 27.4 per cent.

The Scottish Labour party described the statistics as ‘shocking’ and said that they revealed the ‘devastating impact’ of the SNP’s austerity programme that was forcing the public sector to ‘cut services on a scale never before seen’.

The Scottish Conservatives also criticised the statistics and said the SNP’s spending plans needed to be re-examined. The report also highlighted the NHS budget pressures for 2016/17 and 2017/18 calling into question the ‘fundamentally balanced’ NHS budget.

In response the Scottish Conservative’s health spokesperson Mr Mackay said:

"These shocking statistics are a stark reality check for the SNP government on their disastrous record when it comes to NHS services. We all knew that the SNP would cut services but their own figures have now shown the NHS budget is going to be left completely exposed when they’ve made their big NHS budget cuts for the rest of the decade.

“Only last week the NHS admitted that they were breaking in half their A&E waiting times target, so the SNP’s decision to push through their plans at full pace will only worsen those problems.

“It is time for the SNP to stop and listen to the public, so they can address the growing problems within the NHS."

A spokesperson said the First Minister would be meeting union leaders, NHS leaders and NHS professionals to discuss the situation and set out what actions the Scottish Government will be taking to tackle the issues raised.
