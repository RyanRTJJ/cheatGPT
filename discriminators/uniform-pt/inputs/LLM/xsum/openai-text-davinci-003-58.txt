Local charities have stepped in to help her pay for medicine and food, while organizations have worked to ensure that she has basic needs such as blankets and firewood in winter.

Despite her age and poverty, Zlatic still holds onto hope that she may one day be able to get the legal protection she needs. With her husband’s death, her son, who lives in Australia, could legally assume responsibility for her, if he chose.

“I have nowhere else to turn,” she said. “My husband is gone and all I have is faith that I will be taken care of.”
