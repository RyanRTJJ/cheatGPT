 drug use.

The festival, originally planned for June, has never fully recovered after an internal investigation by a former police officer found "unsafe and inappropriate" security measures and "miscellaneous acts of terrorism," the organizers said and vowed to fight for.

"In order to preserve the heritage of this event for future generations, we have set up a non-profit organization to take a non-profit break from the festival," said festival spokesperson Amy B. Brown.

The last time two of the festival's bands will headline was in 2005, when one of them, The Beach Boys, said on video, "They've got the power, and we don't own it." This year has been especially tumultuous with festival attendees citing the recent arrest and detention of members from the group Peaceful Streets in Austin.

The festival is scheduled to go into hiatus by the end of the year, though Bannenberg says the organizers are "going through something that will be really exciting."

The 2017 festival will focus on music and music events that have a similar focus, including a music show in Nashville for 2017. Bannenberg said, and others, the group is "moving up the list."

A report this week from the Nashville bureau of the US Department of Transportation, which tracked the events to 2016, revealed an estimated 1,062 cases of vehicle-related injuries and fatalities since 2000 â€” including those for a concert in San Francisco last month. That's nearly twice the number of deaths the festival reported.

But the FBI's National Transportation Safety Board found no links between illegal and nonviolent drug use at Trump's festival. The report found no link between alcohol consumption and motor vehicle crash fatalities in the state.
