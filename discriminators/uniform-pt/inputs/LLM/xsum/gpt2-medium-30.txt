acey Fenton described seeing Ms Collins, who was still wearing her swimsuit, lying in a pool of blood.

She told police: "We immediately saw her and noticed she had louse and blood dripping from her head and nose.

"She went down with severe louse as well as blood coming out of her mouth and she was still in water so we ran to help her."

Cops have searched a house in the area where she was believed to have died and are appealing for witnesses.

Loretta and Lila McEwan

Loretta, 12, had previously been reported missing last September after she went missing on the road with her father.

Her disappearance was one of three that followed.

In March, 16-year-old Lila's mother, Lizzie, went looking for Lacey after her mother's sister rang and told her that Lizzie had been seen walking alone in a dark, muddy field on a hot afternoon.

Lizzie's parents, Michael and Lizzie McEwan, said she was "just a lovely girl with two wonderful brothers", while they were delighted to have been reunited.

Detectives are treating the new case of the missing girls as a suspected murder investigation, despite the initial reports to the police that it was an abduction.

Detectives are appealing to anyone with information to contact them immediately on 101 quoting unit 007.

Anyone having contact with the girls or any information about the case should contact police on 101 quoting unit 011 quoting unit 1137.
