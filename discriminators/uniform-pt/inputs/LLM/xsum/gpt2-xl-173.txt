 her tweets. "I will find you and I will kill you. Get well soon!" she wrote.

Some of the first Twitter users to see the pictures were IS supporters but she soon gained the attention of other Twitter users. Many asked the French President if she still had the photographs.

Ms Le Pen and Mr Hollande agreed to meet privately to discuss the issues arising from the photographs. They also met representatives from the three social networks.

Mr Hollande has said he does not like to meet officials in person "unless it is in a small group", but he said he believed social networking sites like Twitter were the "first line of defence" against terrorists.

Mr Le Pen said the photographs were in fact "in no way at all pornographic (or) pornographic content," but did not say what the French President was looking for in her tweets.

One of the pictures appeared to show Ms Le Pen and Mr Macron eating dinner together.

The pair have never met face to face.

When the interview was conducted, Mr Hollande said that if in 2017, Mr Macron's "policies and the programme of the government will be the same as his predecessor's then I would be happy to ask Mr Macron to choose me for the premiership of the government."

At the time, the French President called the idea that Mr Macron could be the country's president "a joke".

President Trump has yet to comment on the row.

The pictures emerged as Le Pen's presidential rival, Francois Fillon, also defended the photographs, which he said were taken after the pair had spent most of their lunch together.

"They went out to eat, got some coffee and left behind the photographs, so that people should think about it," Mr Fillon told French TV.
