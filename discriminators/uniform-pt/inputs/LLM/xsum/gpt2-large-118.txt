Meanwhile Japan's air force fighter jets struck suspected Chinese missile launchers in the waters in the South China Sea, according to Japanese media.

"We fired a total of 34 aircraft against the missiles," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a weekly press briefing.

"The radar track shows those units are likely the same as a Chinese launcher," he said.

Guns at sea?

Suga added that Tokyo had no prior knowledge that missile launches were underway.

"We do not believe that China is engaging in such activities," he said. "It is up to China to respond."

Pyongyang reacted angrily after the Japanese move appeared to be aimed primarily at keeping Chinese ships out of the contested South China Sea.

"We categorically reject Japan's reckless and unjustified action, and call on Japan to be calm," a foreign ministry spokesman said.

"If Japan truly believes in its right to'self-defence' it should make some sort of public statement. North Korea has no right, and will not make any arrangements for Japan to'self-defend,'" the spokesman told reporters.

There were initial reports the missile launch was timed to coincide with the Lunar New Year holiday for China's people. But Chinese media said the missile test was timed to coincide with the start of the Muslim holidays.

Japan's new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made his stance on North Korea much clearer in comments on Tuesday, as he stressed the need to maintain an armistice with North Korea.

"I am determined that we will always keep the armistice... and ensure peace on the peninsula in the future," Abe said, during a visit at the US embassy in Tokyo.

But he did add that "Japan's nuclear force is a national prerogative" and insisted that Japan is entitled to defend itself.

South Korea's unification ministry also said "several missile launchers" had been fired, and reported no damage or casualties.

It gave no further details.
