While the Scottish Health Board says it's keeping hospital waiting times short for all patients it says it needs more capacity to deal with the demand.

It is now investing £500m to improve and upgrade inpatient care through a multi-lateral approach to increase its capacity and manage wait times for patients, particularly those with complex disorders.
