 claimed she "lacked the confidence in him which his mother had described and for which he had to be 'lucky' in surviving".

The trial took a bizarre turn last month when Mr Nolan accused his defense lawyers of using a "mystery scene" after learning his client did not suffer from paranoid schizophrenia, as Mr Parker claimed.

When Mr Nolan finally gave an update during closing arguments on Monday, it was met by deafening boos before lawyers for the prosecution told the jury: "The witness who had been asked questions asked by the trial judge can stand now."

The jury was not allowed to hear from Mr Nolan's defence counsel, Jonathan Rousman QC.

Mum-of-two Katelyn Parker, originally from Havering, north London, died in 1988 between her home outside Milton Keynes and her parents' home in Manchester.

She was an English teaching assistant at a primary school, before taking up a full-time job working as a receptionist at an energy company from 2010 until 2013.

The trial has been called a murder mystery after the court was told her mother had described her as having "fear, anxiety and an inability to accept responsibility".

The prosecution were forced to call a psychiatric examination after it emerged there was insufficient evidence to support the theory of reduced responsibility.

Katelyn was stabbed in her kitchen one morning in August 2008.

She had been to an evening tea with her brother James and parents for lunch and was having a drink with co-workers when it is understood she left a flat in Manchester that was not occupied and returned three hours later.

Ms Parker had been at work at the time, but later told the hearing two of her friends had phoned to say they were being robbed outside a house in Milton Keynes.
