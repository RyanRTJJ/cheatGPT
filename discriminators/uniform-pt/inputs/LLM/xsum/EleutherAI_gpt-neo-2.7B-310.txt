 cost any additional charge for customers who spent more than £25.

However, a £3 fee will now be applied if customers do decide to spend more than £20 for delivery. The fee will apply to both Standard delivery and express delivery orders for all delivery addresses across the UK.

Other charges of £3 will also apply for Standard delivery (including all orders for next working day or next day delivery on Friday, Saturday & Sunday, and all orders excluding over £200) and Express delivery.

In addition, any orders made with the code 'Super Saver Delivery 2015' will receive a £4 refund on any delivery fees if the order is not delivered and collected within the specified timescale.

Customers will now also be billed £9 per order to claim this refund, regardless of the order's value. In addition, customers will have the option to purchase an additional £9 to help reimburse delivery costs.

Customers that spend more than £40 for Standard delivery will also have to pay a £9.50 delivery fee, but will not need to use the Super Saver Discount. The same applies for Express orders over £100.

All orders placed by 12 noon on Friday, 7 July will include free delivery by the delivery method you select and any additional options. Orders placed before that time but more than £200 are eligible.

Once the order has been confirmed or the deadline has passed, customers will have to pay the delivery charge as normal.

The delivery charge will now vary depending on the weight and size of the item ordered and will be automatically calculated by the online store at checkout.

If there is no delivery cost on the website, then no delivery notice will be visible when customers click 'place order' or 'confirm delivery'.

This new offer applies to purchases made from within the UK and does not apply outside of the UK. The online store's 'Super Saver delivery' discount is not applicable to orders to delivery addresses in the European Union and may have different terms and conditions outside of the 28-country UK.
