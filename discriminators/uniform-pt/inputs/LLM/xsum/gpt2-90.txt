 the added benefit of a wider range of power units and higher compression ratios to provide power to the next generation Chevrolet crossover while also increasing fuel economy.

"The 1.6L will enable car makers to scale up production and offer lower fuel prices to consumers and buyers," Volkswagen's head of design, Martin Wehrlein, said in a statement on Thursday.

"For example, Volkswagen had been developing their 1.6L diesel engine during the winter of 2014 for a while. After testing, we decided that 1.6L engines that would produce less emissions than standard fuel would be offered to customers. It is anticipated that 1.6L engines will become a mainstream feature of all European models."

Although VW plans to replace the 1.6L with a diesel engine next year, it's not yet clear that it will work for long stretches of the life of the crossover.

In the meantime, the crossover has been a success for the VW Group, which has always had the advantage of its crossover brand with the majority of the crossover's marketing sales going to the same vehicles. VW, the biggest automaker of the past decade, has also said its 1.6L and 3.0L hybrids will be the next most powerful crossover in its lineup.

Volkswagen is currently only offering the 1.6L diesel version in the U.S. before its production is cut by about a third, down from nearly 5,300,000 in 2010.

But Volkswagen already has started showing up in the more aggressive competition, too. "VW has shown to be very responsive to automakers who are seeking to take advantage of the high performance potential of its 1.6L, while at the same time also being highly competitive with their competitors," said Joe O'Rourke, chief executive officer and general manager of VW Global, a non-corporate investment firm.
