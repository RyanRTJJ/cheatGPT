n't feasible financially or logistically for the plebiscite to occur.

The Australian Senate's report concluded that a plebiscite on marriage equality is not feasible. It said that any attempt to hold a non-binding plebiscite, as proposed by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, would be costly, potentially disruptive and unlikely to result in a successful outcome. It also noted that such a plebiscite would be unlikely to resolve the difficult issues surrounding the debate on marriage equality in Australia. The report recommended that legislative change be pursued by the government in order to achieve marriage equality.
