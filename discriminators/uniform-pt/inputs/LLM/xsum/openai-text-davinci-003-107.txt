 has scored twice for the Bluebirds so far this season.

"He is unproven at this level and it takes time for him to adapt to the physical side of the Championship and the pace," said Neil Warnock.

"He will have all the time he needs here because we are not under any pressure in the league."

However, Warnock insisted he may not fit in with Cardiff's style: "I'm not sure Kenneth is what I want in the Championship, to be honest. But we are looking to develop him. He has a great future ahead of him, I'm sure."

The striker, formerly of Brondby, has taken less time to find his feet than new signing Yuparo, but is unlikely to hold the starting place for more than a few more games.

Meanwhile, in goalkeeper news, David Marshall remains in Cardiff's squad despite interest from a number of clubs including Danny Wilson's Sheffield United.

"He still has something to offer this team," said Warnock. "I'm really pleased with the attitude of Dave and the way he's been training and playing."

The Bluebirds boss admitted that departures were likely in the transfer window, with Peter Whittingham having already left for Blackburn.

"We've got quite a few players who still need to find clubs and I want to offload them really quickly so we can move on and get somebody else in," he said.

"We've always got offers in for players but they never seem to come up to what they value themselves at."

The transfer window closes at 11pm BST on Wednesday.
