 think it is ever appropriate to execute someone, down from 75% in favor at its peak in the 1970s and 1980s. The highest number now is 53%, from 1988, in opposition, a decade when several state executions were carried out.

In contrast, as recently as 2000, the proportion of Americans saying that executions should not be carried out was at 58%.

Most notable about the drop is the difference in opinion among black Americans and whites. Over half (55%) of whites then still favored capital punishment, but today only a third (33%) do. Among blacks it is more like a fifth (19%).

However, nearly eight in ten black adults (79%) now think that when a convicted person is sentenced to death, executions should not be carried out because he or she is innocent. In 2000, this was true of six in ten black adults (60%).

In contrast, about eight in ten whites believe that if executed a person is guilty (83%). And in the most-recent survey, more whites (61%) than did so in 2000 (54%).

And more whites (66%) today than did so in 2000 believe that the death penalty works as a deterrent, compared with fewer (49%) black adults.

Most black adults (81%) also believe that the death penalty makes mistakes more likely to happen. This includes three in ten whites (28%) and nearly half (46%) of those who are not black.

However, nearly six in ten black adults (59%) oppose executions even when a convicted person is guilty to prevent future death-sentenced inmates from committing similar crimes. This is unchanged over the past decade.

Among whites who are not black, that proportion is just under half (48%). In 2000, white adults who were not black opposed the punishment by a margin of 57% to 39%.

In contrast, a plurality of whites (49%) say they think that when someone is convicted and sentenced to death, the state should execute him or her to prevent other death-sentenced inmates from committing a similar crime.

This view is fairly uniformly shared among whites regardless of racial identity. It is held by at least 80% of blacks
