The death toll has risen to five from Saturday's summit, and several others have died in the previous two and a half years after being lost in the mountain.

On the previous day, in 2010, more than 300 other hikers died when avalanche equipment failed on Mount Chequamegon. Five climbers died, five injured and eight more people suffered serious injuries.

The deaths have been attributed to an avalanche-related avalanche and weather over night, the weather bureau said. It was not available Friday to say how many hikers lost their lives on the day, but weather forecasters had previously projected that five deaths likely would have occurred on Saturday, in the previous five days.

Mount Chequamegon's summit is more than 1.6km high, but at least 80cm of snow had fallen by midafternoon.

Hazardous weather on Mt Chequamegon's face has made the climb by foot, using snow flurries to avoid the heavy footfall. Weather forecasters expect that the snow and snowflakes on Friday could be even further delayed by heavy winds.

There was just 50cm of snow in the forecast in Saturday, up from 25 on Friday, and less than 30cm on Monday, weather forecasters said.

An early morning wind chill could hamper those efforts to find volunteers who lost their lives on Mount Chequamegon.

On Monday, snow and snow flakes could be reported up to a metre away and the Mount Chequamegon Disaster Risk Management committee was asking the public to keep their windows open at night in a bid to get more information on the weather, while residents in the affected communities were
