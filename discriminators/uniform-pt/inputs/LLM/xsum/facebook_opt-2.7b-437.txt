% in July 2020, according to ONS data.

Overall, there were a record 819,000 unfilled roles in July, an increase of 27,000 compared to the same time last year. This is the largest number on record for a single month in two years.

The rate of joblessness remained high in the North - with one in eight workers in the North unemployed compared to less than one in ten in other parts of the UK.

Unemployment in the North of England and Wales increased by 15,000 in July compared to the previous year, while unemployment rose in Scotland as well as in the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber.

Job vacancies also rose in July - by around 60,000 on the previous month to a total of 1.19m, according to the CIPD.

But CIPD business and economics director Alpesh Paleja said that there are fears that the coronavirus crisis, and ongoing unemployment, could impact the economic recovery in the second half of the year.

"In July we saw the highest number of vacancies we’ve ever recorded," he said. "But there are concerns that this strong increase in job openings may not lead to a strong increase in job creation, as we’ve seen that the high levels of unemployment may be preventing businesses from hiring.

"With so many redundancies and cuts being made in the private sector, many employers may be reluctant to add more workers.

"This could be even more of an issue with a no-deal Brexit, which is set to make it even harder for UK businesses to secure skilled labour."

The CIPD report also said that wages are the lowest they’ve been since the start of the financial crisis in 2007.

While annual average hourly wage growth stood at 2.4% in July, it was the lowest since December 2008, according to data from the TUC.
