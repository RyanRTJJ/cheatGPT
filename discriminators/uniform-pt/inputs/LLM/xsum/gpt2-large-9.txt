A source in charge of organising the wedding said the couple will "not be able to celebrate this momentous occasion," adding that they will be staying at their house until the wedding preparations are finished.

"The husband and wife remain in good-standing with each other and with the state," the statement said.

In the past, the couple married on the same day at a church in St Petersburg, with state TV presenting the whole ceremony.
