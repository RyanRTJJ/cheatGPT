In a major speech on Friday, the Labour leader will argue that the "living standards crisis" facing the country can only be addressed by reforming Britain's welfare system so that it puts families on track to enjoy sustained increases in standard of living.

His claim will be that many of his proposals for a future Labour government will not, in themselves, raise the level of living standards for people. Rather, by increasing productivity and investment, they will allow that standard to rise.

But he will also argue that such long term savings can only be made by raising productivity: "We will need to save in the short term and invest in the long run because that is the only way to deliver enduring improvements in living standards."

His ambition to raise productivity means he will argue that the welfare system must be radically rethought: "If the best we can do is to maintain or return to the pre-2008 living standards of today, then we will be doing a bad job of reforming our economy and we will be responsible for our broken society."

And the third element is
