 Jane Austen and Stephen Hawking on the new £10 note is a “token gesture”.

Dear [Conservative MP],

Thank you for raising the issue of diversity on our banknotes. At the Bank of England, we take great pride in the fact that series of notes form part of the country’s history and are cultural objects that link generations of British citizens. This is why it is so important for our notes to reflect the richness, breadth and diversity of the history of our people.

We were delighted when Her Majesty The Queen approved the choice of two people who are undoubtedly iconic figures in the history of Great Britain to appear on the newly-released £10 notes. Jane Austen and Stephen Hawking are both highly deserving recipients, who in their very different ways have made a huge impact on the sum of human knowledge, and the way in which we understand the world around us.

In deciding on the choice of figures, we looked at a wide range of criteria – including their influence on society and the extent to which they were recognised by the public – to select the two most widely recognised figures to have made an especially significant contribution to the history of Great Britain respectively. We are proud to have both of them immortalized in this new series of notes.

I hope this letter has helped to clarify any concerns you have about the choice of figures for our notes. We are aware of the importance of diversity in British society, and considered this very carefully in making our decision.

Yours sincerely,

Mark Carney
