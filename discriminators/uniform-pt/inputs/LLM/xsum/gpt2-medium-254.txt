 said she didn't want the sticky substance coming out of her daughter's anus. Kaya would continue to poop while vomiting in the toilets. Nicole, 39, said: "You see everything - clothes, toilet sheets, the dog. "She wasn't in a good mood."

Nicole told the Guardian: "Kaya wouldn't really eat. She just wouldn't eat." She said she rushed her daughter to a treatment centre for over 11 hours before she lost consciousness and went into cardiac arrest on Saturday. Nicole said: "We have no idea what she was on - perhaps anesthetic?"

The former head butcher and father-of-two said the glue was removed "at the peak of the panic"

"A friend of mine was going to the shop and she spotted my daughter's toilet and thought it was normal. I thought, 'what can be normal?'" he said.

"She was in shock. I was really devastated. Then the school nurses got to her and they found her on the fag end of the glue." He said: "Kaya's mum came out and said she knew the glue was nasty and put some on to see if it would do anything. Kaya would not go back in the fags again. "The glue would get stuck in the walls and the floor."

"If I wasn't around, it would have caused a lot of pain. It would take my life. "One of your first actions after a situation like this is to have a little bit of sympathy." Although the glue has since been removed, Kaya's condition is now said to be "terribly difficult".

"She still has a lot to learn about her body," his mum said. "She will be getting a massage at home today". "It's very tragic," one relative told ITV News. "It has been terrible going over everything the last three days." Kaya's mother told the BBC: "I told him off saying it is no fun. He has no clue. He thought he had been to a friend's house. "He didn't know anything. It's horrible. "There is a lot we did and were aware of.
