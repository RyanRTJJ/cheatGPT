 of a knee problem.

Goalkeepers:

Costel Pantilimon (Middlesbrough) – 15: Last-minute saving from Mame Biram Diouf to deny the lively striker.

Boro's Joe Hart (Manchester City) – 19: Got into position to deny Kevin De Bruyne with some excellent stopping to keep out a well-struck volley.

James Tomkins (Everton) – 21: A good outing after a disappointing loss to Hull City last week as he stopped two free-kicks and kept out a volley from a well-placed Tomer Hemed.

Defenders:

David Luiz (Chelsea) – 15: Stood up to a lively Steven N'Zonzi in the early stages and then provided a great tackle to deny Mame Biram Diouf.

John Stones (Everton) – 20: Capped his club's Premier League start, stopping Nemanja Matic's first-time effort after cutting out a cross.

Javier Manquillo (Roma) – 18: Got a couple of clean sheets before taking time to settle but his pass was too quick to keep out a long ball from Hemed.

Mame Biram Diouf (Middlesbrough) – 19: Hailed from the stands before the break for how good he was with the ball and he made his mark on the game, beating Marko Arnautovic twice and playing a key role in getting a goal on a day when he played some good defence.

Trent Alexander-Arnold is out with a knee problem and will be replaced by Simon Francis.

Midfielders:

Alexandre Lacazette (Lyon) – 19: Put the fear of God into Wolves as he scored against Newcastle. He finished a great move from the left and played some great passes in the middle.

Javier Pastore (Real Madrid) – 13: A great, quick move from Raul Meireles which led to his goal. He played several very incisive passes down the flank as Wolves were a threat.

Lamine Kone (Barcelona) – 10: Had great control on Danny Graham for the goal.
