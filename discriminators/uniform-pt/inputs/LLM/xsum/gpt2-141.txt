This course provides an educational base for students to understand a wide range of topics, from basic mathematics and physics to natural law, statistics and probability. The college is aiming to have 400 students graduate from UT in the second half of 2016.

"The ability of students to understand, evaluate and formulate solutions to problems they solve on one-on-one," said Sarah Siegel, associate director of public relations for the College of Engineering. "We hope that this course addresses what we find through previous work and student responses.
