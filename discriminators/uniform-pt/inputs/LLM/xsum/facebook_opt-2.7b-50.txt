 workers were entitled to 10 hours annual leave per year under the national system, or just over one week of annual leave in total each year, with some allowed more leave if they are "highly qualified" for exceptional conditions in their jobs.

Employers are not required to give leave for family reasons, which in some cases can involve paying employees to take time off. One in five organisations have also introduced a "diversity benefit" that entitles some part-time employees to at least one day's annual leave.

However, in a paper on family pay and benefits written earlier this year, the Resolution Foundation thinktank warned that the new UK gender pay gap rules could not stop low paid women working more but still earn lower pay than comparable men, as it argued that the introduction of the "top rates" would be "too small" to redress the scale.

Workers who do not get annual leave have also been missing out on one of the UK's biggest forms of benefits. Of those employees in the private sector who worked at a firm with fewer than 250 workers, 45 per cent had no access to the government sponsored universal credit, compared to 19 per cent for those with a company of 15,000 or more workers and just 2.5 per cent for those working in the public sector.

The new rules also state that employees who are off sick will receive at least two weeks of sick pay to equal the national minimum wage. This is due to come into effect from 1 January next year when the employment bill comes into force. The new rules also give the trade unions the right to seek an independent review of unfair non-standard or unfair dismissed cases, provided it considers whether the pay or conditions were a factor in the employee's employment decision. This was not previously possible, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said.

Employers should pay all staff the legally required minimum wage if they have worked at least 29 hours in the last seven days, unless they are classed as exempt from the requirement.
