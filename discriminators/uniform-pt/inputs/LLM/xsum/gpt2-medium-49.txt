. Why is it being held in Rio? To avoid the possibility of protests, security has been tightened. The Games run for 18 months from August 15 or 16 and will be moved to December 5, 2016. Are your local schools going to take part? Almost certainly yes, some schools will. I was very impressed by the BBC's analysis yesterday evening and will be doing similar for future editions. I can't believe the media are still talking about the cost of these stadiums. How do I know? They have a blog about how these events are going to look. Is there anyone I should talk to to hear what's happening now? If you would like further information on the Olympics, do get in touch.
