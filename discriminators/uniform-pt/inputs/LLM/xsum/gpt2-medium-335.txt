Peace said: "I hope this helps with a quick solution, I have a lot of work ahead of me to get all your work done."

The identity of the hacker who sold the data for 4 BTC ($24) from his account has not been disclosed.

It is believed the hacker used a Russian-based proxy server and a site to route the data through Russia's state-controlled internet service provider, RT.

The server, which is now offline, redirected the stolen files to an unencrypted URL, meaning the money – which was not stored on the server – was "at the beginning of the first day to second day of the first week", according to one of the emails which the hacker received from the account.

In another message the hacker said he was in touch with the hacker's sister, who added: "We understand and will give you more details about your work very quickly."

On another email sent earlier this week, the victim wrote: "For the time being, I have some time to go."
