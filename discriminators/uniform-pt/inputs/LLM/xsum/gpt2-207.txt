Police were told that Khan, who was known to police for being a "dumbass Muslim" in his teens, had recently "watered down" his past.

The 23-year-old, who had been in prison for a similar offences, had claimed in a statement that he was being bullied by his peers.

"He is a smart and funny man. He has an excellent voice and is well versed in this country and has been a strong member and advocate of issues that matter to those who cannot live this way," the statement added.

Neighbours said the incident had also raised questions over his social standing in the UK.

Preston said: "I've never seen someone as smart and funny as he was.


"He's a good person. He's always got a good heart and I've never seen him with a heart so broken.

"It's not hard to believe he made an innocent joke but people who saw him were so surprised."

Det Supt Alex Smith said it was "incredibly sad" to hear about Khan's appalling death.

"The man who killed another British citizen was a man who had lost faith in his faith and then had to come clean. He had a wonderful life. He was a genuine and dedicated person. It is truly heartbreaking that he was killed," he said.

"He was a good guy, great sense of humour and a genuine supporter of this country and I am shocked at the whole thing and believe he should not have been doing this."


Khalid, who was married to Labour MP Peter Bone during their tenures at the MP's mansion, was a member of the Muslim community for nearly 15 years before becoming a Muslim convert to Islam in 2004, according to the Independent.
