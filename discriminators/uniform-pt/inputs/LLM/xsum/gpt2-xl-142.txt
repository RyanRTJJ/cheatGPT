"We were in incredible form at the start and obviously there wasn't a lot around," said Watson, 26.

It took a thrilling final two days to decide the final of the World Championship.

Britain's Laura Trott missed her chance of winning the race following an error by German rider Kathrin Hammes in the closing part of the stage, but her compatriot Jenni Heinrich also missed out after dropping out in the closing kilometres.

She also lost out to Italy's Luca Paolini in the race's first stage, before making her move on the final climb.

"When you get to the finish line it happens so quickly," said Popp.

"It was a very, very difficult race for me. I'm just so happy to have finished this morning in an amazing position and here at home in my home country. Great things can still happen. It's just fantastic."

Team GB's fourth overall winner in the world women's road race and first since Joanna Rowsell in 2008 added: "I was proud to be on the same podium together [with Popp].

"It's not often I can get into an equal position with the team leader so I hope the fans here today can enjoy the moment and maybe the girls and the boys from the boys' teams are hoping to be there on the podium too."
