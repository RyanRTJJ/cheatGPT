Raja, who is also president of the Democratic People's Party (DUP), said the police had asked his office for cooperation with her when she went home that morning. Asked whether they had received any information that she was behind the plot.

"They were trying to trick her into telling them because they thought her the person behind it, so they didn't understand how they would believe it," Raja told News Corp Japan.

"Even if it is just a plot, or the plot is true, they don't know how to handle it."

It is unclear who was behind the group or what it was doing. Police and security experts said the attackers were trying to recruit people to take advantage of their influence and would try to intimidate women.

The police chief is seeking witnesses. He said last month that he was aware that people were attempting to buy tickets for his election campaign. There have been calls to his office for news about the two "hijackers".

Kiyoto said the motive for the attacks had not yet been ascertained.

"In the end all they're trying to do is to use their time and money to make themselves a scapegoat. There is no such thing as a victim. I will never be able to blame this on her. It's all on them."

The police investigation was conducted by Raul Mihai, who, from August 3 to 8, became prime minister on June 28 after the government resigned. It led to a massive investigation by the national police force. Mihai's successor as prime minister, Kamijima Nishioka, has now become the leader of his party against the opposition, but his role as chief secretary has been left unfinished.

After the election, Nishioka had appointed Mihai as secretary for security. But despite her appointment, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is holding up the first law-and-order ceremony of his presidency, has had to step down as defense minister.
