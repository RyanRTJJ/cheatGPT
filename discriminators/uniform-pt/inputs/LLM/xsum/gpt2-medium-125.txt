He was appointed manager of English champions Cardiff Blues midway through last season, when he won 13 of the next 18 games in charge.

The 48-year-old added: "That is how you should feel when you have achieved what you have done over an extended period of time.

"It makes you want to do better. You always want to do that so you can continue living life on the edge and I think that's what has happened in my career."

He added: "Being a successful manager means you don't like to lose games, you don't like to get too lost in the details of where you have to take a victory, and I think we're always working towards a certain direction.

"We just need time to work it all out."

The Welsh Rugby Union's Six Nations tour of northern Europe this summer, also including Germany, will be one of England's toughest competitions to handle.

But Hogg revealed he had not been afraid to take chances along the way.

He said he "did not have doubts about his performance to lead England to victory over the Germans" in Cardiff, and said that victory put him in a good mood.

"There is a period before Christmas and it's all very much in the minds of our players and coaches," he said.

"A lot of things can influence people and that's really the key to this job.

"The only time you can get carried away is when it's impossible to take and it's not time to worry about anything.

"The one bad game last Autumn was an aberration that wasn't what we will be talking about and I don't want that to hold me back this time around...

"I am definitely not going to let anything negative come to my head.

"If I am in the same situation, I will go into the game with a healthy sense of optimism and with the belief, 'Here we are and we won.'"
