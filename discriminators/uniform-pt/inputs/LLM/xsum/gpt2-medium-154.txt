 for Ireland's support.

It may be the case that the UUP has been persuaded that other factions must be weakened to survive as an administration. However, the result of the result will be another minority of the new DUP, of which a substantial minority is now in Stormont and the UUP can expect to gain a further 14 seats. In order to maintain its power over Northern Ireland, the UUP is going to have to be as radical as possible in its aims.

At present, despite much hand-wringing over its ambitions, the UUP appears capable of getting rid of the entire existing legislative body (excluding the Northern Ireland Assembly but including the Assembly of Northern Ireland in Westminster). It will be able to use the Northern Ireland Assembly's powers of "retroactive removal" to remove the Northern Irish Executive in due course from power, but in so doing it may find itself effectively excluded from power altogether.

This is a scenario reminiscent of the recent episode in which the British government managed to remove and dissolve the United Kingdom Parliament within three weeks by simply changing the voting thresholds. This is the same process taken up in Northern Ireland today, whereby at the moment there are eight seats in the new DUP and only one in the UUP, meaning that the UPA is unlikely to gain an overall majority.

At present, the Ulster Unionist Party will continue to rule out any sort of future cooperation with another coalition party. However, the Irish Times has recently reported that Sinn FÃ©in wants to have talks with the DUP about extending its influence in Northern Ireland. In particular, the UUP's concerns about UUP leadership remain.

The power of the UUP and the DUP can be expected to become a strong point in talks. In this regard, negotiations over the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP)'s leadership continue, with various senior figures including former Deputy First Minister Peter Robinson
