 legal team says he is innocent, will also be sentenced on Wednesday for shooting his neighbour, James Mair, 21.


A jury convicted Gage and Mair in 2010 after nearly two months of deliberations.


Gage is the second Scottish police officer to go to prison in five years following a murder charge. In June, Michael McCann, 52, was jailed for life for the murder of his partner at their home in Dunbroch, North Lanarkshire.

An ambulance is seen arriving at the scene at 8.28am. The caller has trouble holding back tears and apologises for any distress caused to her and her child. Police were summoned the next morning and it was revealed that an investigation was launched.
