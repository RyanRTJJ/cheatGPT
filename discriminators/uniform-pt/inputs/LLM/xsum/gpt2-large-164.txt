"It was a really exciting final," Martin added.

Canada manager Scott Smith was impressed. He said: "We had a lot of confidence coming into this game.

"We knew we were at home, we're good at winning and we know what kind of fans here and all the facilities."

Nathan Hirayama shot wide from 10 yards after a neat one-two between himself and forward Chris Duvall, and Canada only had luck to their side in the closing stages when Hirayama was sent off for a challenge on winger Jermaine Johnson.

"I have no complaints with the sending-off - because he's a good player but I think the way he sent him off was pretty unprofessional." Canada captain Cyle Larin added.

Hirayama was sent off for dangerous handling

New Zealand won in the shootout as goalkeeper Steve Hansen denied Canada's Olli Luuttu and Hirayama, while defender Michael Petrasso's side were unlucky not to score first themselves when midfielder Matt Finnerty's pass went out for a corner.

"The team was ready because they are playing in front of their home supporters, they want to win this game," said Smith.

"They want to beat someone; not New Zealand."
