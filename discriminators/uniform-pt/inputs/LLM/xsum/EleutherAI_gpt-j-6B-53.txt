 an All-American for the University of Georgia, has been struggling to meet her full potential. After just missing out on a spot on the U.S. team at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Johnson-Thompson became the ninth American to make it to World Championships. She’s also been the most decorated American sprinter in the discipline. She owns five world championship golds and four world medals overall. With the United States hosting the World Championships in Tokyo for the fourth time during this quadrennial event, Johnson-Thompson will look to use that track legacy to her advantage. It’s not an understatement to say that you can place your bets on her being the U.S. 100m gold-medalist at the 2020 Olympic Games within four years.

This summer, the Australian sprinter, who was the first American to finish in the top three at World Championships, will try and continue her quest of being a major force in the event for the world. The 29-year-old has also competed at Olympic Games and World Championships and is the holder of two national titles, 200m and 100m. Also a five-time World bronze medalist, Bowie may not be the favorite at the World Championships, particularly after not being able to meet expectations in Rio.

6. Ajee Wilson

Her performances at the Worlds have been inconsistent, ranging from first place and world-leading times to being out of contention. At last year’s championship, she was a surprise winner and finished second overall. At the 2014 World Cup, she was a bronze medalist at 50m and 100m.

7. Christine Ohuruogu

The 31-year-old English sportsman who was ranked as the second best 50m sprinter and fifth fastest woman in 2015 and 2016, might have only missed out on a bronze medal at World Championships in Moscow. However, her performances at major championship show she is definitely up to the challenge of competing with the best around the globe. In 2013, she became the first woman to run 50m in 4.50
