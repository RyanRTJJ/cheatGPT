 to Â£1.02m.

In the past 10 years, ambulance and fire service ambulance spending has increased by a factor of 9.

Of the 3,600 emergency vehicles now operating in the capital, only 1,100 are operated by the ­government.

Mr Cameron made his claim in his letter to the editor of the Daily Mail asking if he could have been the victim of a false claim for ambulance work that could have taken place in London.

He said: "My wife was seriously injured in a car-jacking in 2011 by two men who ran a red light and then threatened her in a terrifying way as they stole her motorbike.

"She needed urgent hospital treatment and the police were called but she was never even taken to the hospital for treatment because ambulance and fire service officials say it was not a 999 call.

"I am told that the ambulance service in your city is so under-resourced, they cannot even deal with 999 calls and cannot even treat casualties until they are seen by a doctor."

Mr Cameron also said: "We still have an inordinate number of ambulance staff in ­distressed situations getting into trouble.

"Some are working 16-hour ­days even though they have no extra pay for it."

There is no data available to back up Mr Cameron's claims but it is against law for the NHS and the fire service in England to refuse ambulance services for any patient.

Figures seen by The Mail on Sunday show that in the 12 months to Oct 31, 2011-2013, 13 emergency journeys were handled by private vehicles but this jumped to 246 in 2012-2013, with the cost rising from 2in to £61,000 – or a factor of 9.

As ambulance service chiefs insist there is no cash for any services outside London to help combat rising costs, the Prime Minister's suggestion has caused outrage.

One NHS doctor told the paper: "In London the ­ambulance drivers are working harder than ever and are desperate for extra funding.

"And it's a ­debate which we are having – whether it is the patients who suffer the consequences of this.

"The Government says it ­supports the ambulance service
