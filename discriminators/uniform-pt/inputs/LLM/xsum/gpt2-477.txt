 said no trains were on duty until 6.30am, even though he said it would be a day after all trains on line closed.

There's no news of a strike in the public sector, Cash said.

He cited the introduction of 12mph trains as an example of "troubling times", but he said this wasn't really "a matter of one single person deciding between a few people deciding in a street or a building".

He said it was possible workers might work two trains a day.

Cash said there was currently no plan to introduce more rail service because the market was getting "totally wrong" in terms of trains.

'Not a matter of one single person. It can happen anywhere'

"Yes, people are running train buses and they are going about their business as it would be normal today [because]," he said.

"Of course it has become all too common for people to assume that the railway is going to be a disaster because of this so it is going to be, yes, some catastrophic, but that could be a matter of some
