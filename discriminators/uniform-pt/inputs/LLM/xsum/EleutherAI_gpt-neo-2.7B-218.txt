"I've never seen anything like it, nothing like this in England. We've got the infrastructure. We've got the planning laws. We've got the finance. We've got the investment. We've got the expertise - you're talking about £2.2 million hospital that will be up and running in less than two years. That's a major investment. It's the biggest single investment in this area since the M4 was constructed and the biggest investment ever in this hospital area for this hospital type. It is going to provide an absolutely transformational contribution to patient care in the local area. "It's going to provide another high quality acute hospital facility for the town of Cresswell which is a hospital type. It's a very, very important service for Dumfries and Galloway. "It's probably the most important service for the whole of west Dumfries and Galloway."

Dumfries' medical director John Todhunter said: "These are extremely exciting times for Dumfries. We are now about to embark on our largest ever hospital project, when the former homely unit will be redeveloped into the new Cresswell Hospital.

"The hospital has excellent transport links to Carlisle, Glasgow and Aberdeen and there are several dedicated high-speed links to Carlisle and Glasgow. The site will provide an exceptional patient experience which will have long-term benefits for the local community." Mr Todhunter said the new hospital was expected to be fully open by summer 2019, with a new, £450,000 outpatient department and outpatients opening up in January 2019. Other additions will include a £500,000, £200,000 and £60,000 speciality inpatient wards, with space for seven inpatients. The emergency department will be able to treat 400 inpatients, the main hospital building having space for 300 and eight inpatients. Hospital consultant Peter Gilligan, medical director, said he was "delighted" to welcome the £1.3m and £500,
