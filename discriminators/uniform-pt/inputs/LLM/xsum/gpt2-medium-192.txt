 were likely to be found.

The boat hit a large wave five days ago, leaving the crew and passengers dazed and injured. The vessel had capsized from its cargo, after the crew of some of the passengers were told to abandon ship when the boat hit a wave and overturned.

An autopsy was performed on the nine victims after they were recovered, but authorities have yet to determine the cause of death. Investigators said Thursday it's impossible to determine exactly why the boat sank but confirmed it was an accident.

Authorities were investigating if there were any mechanical problems onboard, and if any "unknown causes" to the disaster were responsible.

The U.S. Navy said Tuesday it would conduct another vessel survey later into the night and investigate the circumstances that led to the sinking because the current survey of that area could take several weeks.

"There is still tremendous uncertainty as to what really led to this tragic event," U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer 3rd Class Ryan Hickey said in a statement on Tuesday night.

In a video statement issued by the Australian Prime Minister in Melbourne where the boat was last seen leaving the country, Australian Premier Julia Gillard said she wanted to thank all those who have helped make sure those who were aboard had the comfort and opportunity to make the journey home safely.

"My deepest sympathies, thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those who have gone missing aboard the MV Comfort, and to their friends and other family members who have also been affected by this tragedy," she said.

The MV Comfort is a 50-metre long, 60-metre, and 50-metre high merchant vessel operating from the port of Java. The vessel was carrying nearly 40 passengers and seven crew from India, Pakistan, Tanzania, Fiji and Thailand.

It appears to have capsized several times in waters off the coast of Sri Lanka since it had to turn out of anchorage in the area because of heavy waves, according to reports on its website.

The vessel was also sailing at speeds of up to 17 knots without warning, according to reports.

The company that made the MV made numerous online videos before reporting its final destination to
