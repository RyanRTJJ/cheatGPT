 a week at the Royal Stoke University Hospital.

The mother-of-three from Taunton, Somerset, has no insurance and her bills are mounting. Last year she was evicted from her home, and says her family are struggling to keep paying her bills.

In January, she was moved to the adult and elderly homes wing of the hospital, so that she could be taken out for meals. She is now living in a converted attic.

On Friday her family will give her a visit and, to support her on Sunday, she will be joined by volunteers from the charity Hope Not Hate. They will deliver letters of support from her regular donor and her family.

"It's not a lot of letters but we want to do something," said Caroline Bigg, of Hope Not Hate.

"We want her to have a lovely day at Royal Stoke, and to feel supported, even if she just feels a little bit loved."

Ms Bigg has been an organ donor since she was 16 with no condition attached. To date, she has been on 15 organ donor lists.

"I have given my organs so I can still have a life," she said.

"Organ donation is wonderful and there are lots of wonderful people going through it."

Ms Nel first found out she was a match for her brother, Dave, when she was still a teenager. She had been ill with kidney failure, and was given two months to live.

"They were waiting for a match to match my kidney" she said.

On learning it was Dave she called him up. "I'm doing this for you," she said.

When her kidney started to deteriorate she stopped donating her platelets, but has been matched with one of Dave.

"It's lovely that I have done it for my brother, she said.

"I've not heard from anyone yet, so I'm in hope there are good people like Dave out there. I am sending him a card."
