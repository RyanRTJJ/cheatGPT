 which will feature the largest enclosed public space in Wales, and the largest underground museum in north Wales - to be complete by 2035.

The new Â£70m site is one block west of St. Joseph's Road, where the Wrexham site was unveiled last year. It is flanked by the Wrexham Public Gallery, St Nicholas Museum (the largest in Wales), St Nicholas Church, St Nicholas Gardens, Wrexham Hospital (which is home to the Queen as well as a host of cultural organisations, including the Arts Council), and the World's Oldest Cemetery.

The new monument has been named after Sir William Shakespeare's "St. Nicholas" because of "this noble example of his greatness from the standpoint of human endeavour in every field, the constant pursuit he pursued despite the odds, the unshakable faith in a future to be better than it was and his constant efforts to improve the lives of others, both men and women - all the while a man so full of love and grace, so generous, so genuine and so full of promise, that he seemed to be an artist as well as an educator."

Named after the 16th century character in Shakespeare's plays who became England's biggest patron and most prominent member of parliament, the new statue reflects the patron saint's belief in helping others.

The new site features an open plan amphitheatre with a large screen that will create a stunning backdrop for the exhibition "Inner Life of St Nicholas". The St Nicholas Museum also will be set up above the amphitheatre.

The new building also includes a new entrance, one of the most modern in Wales, and a new entrance to the underground museum - named after St. Nicholas' own entrance back in 1637. Inside the site will be a separate exhibition hall with new doors and escalators, as well as lifts, for carrying visitors and workers from both the St Nicholas Hospital and the
