allana, Charlie Austin and John Stones were all injured, plus a point in the Scottish side's 4-1 win over Iceland.

Klinsmann had to make four changes to a lineup he was desperate to retain for the most crucial match of the season.

"The players have worked hard over the last 13 matches. We haven't been playing as close as we wanted, but we wanted to make sure that the game didn't collapse and we had to change some games," he said.

"We didn't play with our head in the sand, and we did get into the game with players that had confidence in us.

"To play our best football, it was difficult to do that from the beginning of the season.

"We have to think that we did enough in our first game in Stockholm, as we want it to be, against Scotland in the World Cup. You can't do that against us.

"Now we're making sure we work harder and concentrate on the preparation, and our performance of the year was an indication that we can deliver.

"A good season has come, and we're still trying to get a good run in the league, but we have a whole new group now."

He continued: "From Wednesday to Friday, we will compete with the Premier League to win points and it is important that we have confidence in our work. If we don't come back in front of a strong group like that, the season could have even more difficulties.

"There are three, three fantastic players that we need to get on board. But now we will make the same adjustments as we did against Iceland.

"The next one is tomorrow, and we will see where it goes. We have to look at how good the league is and our game and how we can compete next season."

The Red Devils remain one game back of Scotland in the Asian Champions League next Saturday next month.
