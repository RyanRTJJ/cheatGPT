Maduro's government says it does not need military aid and has said it is fighting a "economic war" against the nation's main opposition group.

But the opposition says the true target of the government's economic war is its political opponents.

More than three million people marched in Caracas in a show of opposition anger on Friday after Mr Maduro accused supporters of the opposition and the US of plotting a military coup.

"It's not a coup, it's an economic war," the government said, referring to a campaign that he said was planned by the United States, its allies and foreign-based businessmen.

"Those who think that the opposition is going to bring us bread, we will kill them with bread. They will perish because we are the ones that are trying to make them a martyr," Mr Maduro said.

He said the government had set up a series of committees to control public order.

"But in no way did we invade the people with all means," he said.
