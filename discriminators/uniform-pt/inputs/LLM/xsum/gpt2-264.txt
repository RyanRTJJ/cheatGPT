bn, by 2020. In particular it calculates that the UK's economy will grow by about 1 per cent per annum.

In addition to this, in 2013 the ONS estimated that the £14bn savings for 2011 must double or triple to 6.5bn and the total tax payment to the Treasury this year will rise by £30bn. The report, which followed comments on the tax plans, highlighted the need to keep those who were to do so.

Although many are paying their fair share, many are simply not paying for the services they need."

Mr Hartler said the ONS report also demonstrated that the UK faces a difficult financial position, facing an ageing and volatile global economy.

"The main reason behind this is the looming general election on the same day as the next General Election - a year before the first-past-the-post vote on the NHS," he said.

"It's very hard to get an election before we elect a new Labour government, particularly on the issues of jobs, immigration and investment.

"So the key question is how long will the next Labour government take to deliver on these key promises - jobs, higher living standards, health and education?"
