 Young, 33, and her sister Lola were arrested in Plymouth on Monday and both have been released on bail.

The glue was detected and police and fire crews attended at the end of February.

Citing police sources, PlymouthLive revealed the girls met on MySpace and arranged for the glue, which cost a bottle of Staroplasz, to be left on the bathroom seat for one hour.

A police spokesperson said: "Following the incident, a number of people were interviewed who were either aware of the incident or who reported it to police.

"After completing a thorough investigation, police have charged Nicole and Lola with breaching an order under the Coroners and Courts Act 2004.

"Although further information was not available at this time, we can confirm that Nicole and Lola Young have been charged with a single count of breaching an order under section 16A of the Coroners and Courts Act 2004."

The girls were bailed until July 22.

PlymouthLive asked if the allegations might have anything to do with Exeter College's "gay youth" night where the college launched an 'All About You' series in a bid to appeal to the young LGBT community.

Last year the college apologised after posters advertising the event said it was 'part of the college's efforts to show that Exeter is open and inclusive to all'.

In a statement Exeter college said: "We have worked hard over recent years at our College to make Exeter college campus more welcoming to people with LGBT+ identity.

"These programmes at the college have created opportunities and platforms that have helped our students to learn more about their own identity.

"Exeter College believes that everyone is entitled to to love, support and to be accepted in their society and in our society.

"We have been in contact with police in relation to the matter which is being investigated by the Devon & Cornwall Police.

"No further information will be provided about this to protect the identity of the young people involved within the investigation."
