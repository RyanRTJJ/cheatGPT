 really big night for him," said Villa boss Paul Lambert. "He's done an absolutely fantastic job for us and if you look at his performances we're already two points ahead of them. I'm not afraid of going beyond him. "He's another one who can score goals. We've just got to keep the ball more so I wouldn't be surprised to see him score more goals. "He's a big-match player, his pace, his goalscoring ability, his pace, his scoring abilities are just all in abundance, the ability to create scoring chances and he's certainly got the ability to do a job for us."

Villa have now conceded just once in their opening six league games and are unbeaten in eight on their travels over the past seven. They will return home with confidence despite the disappointment of last season with a 3-0 defeat by Hull. Lambert did not seem to be too concerned with Villa starting top of the table, even with the loss as his side are still favourites to lift the Champions League trophy. The manager said: "It's important for us to win at home to keep our season in the top four. We can win games if we play well and if we can stay focused and come back the way we do. "We've been pretty tough down there on the road so for us to stay as positive was very important."
