There are no reports of a plea bargain over Nelson's guilty plea, meaning his case is one of the few remaining cases where a defendant has avoided jail. It's a rare case where a guilty plea may mean nothing, however, as Nelson cannot give a clear statement of remorse.

The mother of one of Nelson's victims, Carol Wilshen in the United Kingdom, spoke out in a court hearing last year after finding out about the nature of his guilty plea. Wilshen described the case as a "sad and disturbing discovery", and described it as a "horrific event".

When Nelson is jailed, he will face a minimum sentence of five years. He cannot be given a minimum sentence of less than 12 months, or even 11 months. This means his sentence will depend on the sentence for another person in his category.

A number of victims have spoken up, including the mother of one of the children he assaulted, who has said: "My hope is that this sentence will serve as a warning to any other man who may find himself in this position and that the police use every tool at their disposal including the police and the court to identify and prosecute the type of offending we have witnessed,"

It was found that Nelson had used the same hammer to break into other homes while on bail for these crimes as well.
