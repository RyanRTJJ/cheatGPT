 lifetime mortgage to buy a second unit at the same house price.

A spokesman for the building society confirmed there will be a new rule on "extraordinary rises" of five per cent.

"This includes any extraordinary rise above the current £750,000 mortgage threshold," he said.

The new rules will apply to anyone buying a second home, up to a house value of £500,000.

Last year, the maximum extra mortgage of £1m was increased to £1.45m.

There will be new rules for those buying second homes with loan amounts of up to £250,000.

Under the new rules, a bank will need two working days to approve an increase above the current normal mortgages limit. Once approval has been given, the house must be sold within four working days.

For those with loan amounts above £250,000, the limit will be £1m.

Under the rules, the maximum house price increase to which buyers must comply is a maximum of £75,000.

Some 20,000 new mortgage holders are expected to take advantage of the "extraordinary increase" thresholds in 2012-13.

The move is likely to upset landlords, who could put the brakes on purchases made by new owners.

One local authority insider said: "The vast majority of landlords would rather tenants were not moving.

"This is not really a solution. It could be a bit like letting buy-to-let or letting buy-to-let, but it would be far worse.

"They are already being squeezed, and we are being squeezed by people using these prices - they are desperate."

A survey for the Haringey Labour party, released tomorrow, found 71 per cent of participants are against a new threshold in relation to a second home.

The average price was £520,000, the survey found.

The council is currently discussing plans to introduce a "strict" maximum limit on new mortgages.
