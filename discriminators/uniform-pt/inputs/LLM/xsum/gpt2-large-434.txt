'Screaming like a girl': Cops release chilling CCTV of child killer after arrest in Wrexham

A man is being charged after a five-month investigation after three of his children were found dead in his Wrexham home.

Mark and Catherine Stokes were last seen on Sunday 3 October at around 2pm aged 6 and 9, and had not been seen since.

Police are now investigating the incident as a murder inquiry, after a tip-off about a possible murder weapon.

Stokes was previously known to police and is on the wanted list

He is wanted on suspicion of the disposal of a poisonous substance in a private dwelling, and possession of a firearm or ammunition knowing it is likely to be discharged.

A police spokesman said the three young children found alive were believed to have had poisoning, and two were unresponsive at the time.

One was a girl aged four.

Stokes, who has two sons, faces a maximum one year jail sentence if convicted.

This is the latest in a series of bizarre family deaths.

Earlier last week two children were found dead in their Wrexham home and police were called to reports of a body being left in a car.

It was later revealed all three were suffering from severe injuries.

Police said they are still in the process of investigating the deaths at the Stokes' home.

A man is also wanted in connection with the deaths, and police told The Sun that a weapon has not been linked to any of the children.

Detectives yesterday released a picture of a man they are looking for on suspicion of murdering some children.
