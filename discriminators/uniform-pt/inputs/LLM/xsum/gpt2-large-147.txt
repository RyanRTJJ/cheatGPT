 called on David Cameron to intervene to give patients choice over diet, while Cancer Research UK said it needed more resources to make its treatments more effective.

The Royal College of Cancers in the United Kingdom said the study did not support the "vicious" advice against sugar-sweetened drinks, which are also in the UK Dietary Guidelines and recommended as part of a healthy lifestyle.

Health risks

The US-based American Cancer Society said the study did not provide evidence for or against sugar-sweetened beverages "by any measure". In a statement, the society warned that "drinking artificially sweetened beverages was linked to the development of health and lifestyle diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease."

The British Nurses' Association said its focus was "clearly on the health, health care and social issues that we as nurses care for". It argued that public health campaigns needed to focus on obesity.

"It's important that young people consider the risks of being overweight, which can lead to obesity becoming chronic and devastatingly fatal," it said.

The researchers based their findings on data from Britain's National Patient Survey in 2003, which tracked 3,816 women, with a follow-up in 2009-10. The data is from NHS England, the body responsible for health and social care.

The paper notes that although studies to date had supported the relationship between obesity and diabetes, "there was no indication that weight gain was a causal risk factor for death from any cause, cancer or type 2 diabetes [type 2 diabetes is a condition where the body's cells cannot grow enough to carry out normal work]."

It adds: "Our primary findings suggest that the association between overweight and diabetes is real and exists."

There are concerns that the study could have been influenced by the fact that the women were aged in their mid to late 20s and there were more women who had diabetes.
