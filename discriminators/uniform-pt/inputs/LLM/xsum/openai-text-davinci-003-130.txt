olving drones are being recorded in the UK every day.

The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which collects the data, said the increase was likely because of more drones being flown and also because more people were reporting incidents.

The most common incidents relate to drones flying too high, too close to people or property, or in restricted airspace, such as near airports or airfields.

The CAA said anyone who has seen irresponsible drone flying, or thinks an incident might have occurred, should report it via its website or use its intelligent counter-drone technology system.

The number of incidents involving recreational drones is expected to rise further as more drones are bought and flown, but the CAA has said it is working with police and other organisations to tackle the problem.

Safety rules issued by the CAA include:

• Keeping the drone in your line of sight at all times

• Fly your drone below 400ft in altitude
• Keep your drone away from aircraft, helicopters, airports and airfields
• Always fly your drone within the law
• Follow the manufacturer's instructions
• Respect people's privacy while flying your drone
• Keep the drone away from people and property
