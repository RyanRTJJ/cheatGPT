 conviction of eight men for the grooming, trafficking and sexual exploitation of the girl who was referred to as Girl A.

The report found that, between 2007 and 2011, an organised group of older Asian men were identified as being involved with Girl A, but that despite repeated warnings to a number of individuals and agencies in the Keighley area, little to no action was taken to protect her.

The report concluded that if those involved in the girl’s care had acted on the information they were provided, her exploitation could have been prevented. It was also noted that the failure to protect Girl A was symptomatic of a larger, systemic failure by multiple agencies, including the police, local authority and NHS, to respond to this type of child exploitation.

Therefore, the report concluded that ‘a large-scale failure of organisations, people and systems’ had enabled the men to exert total control over her. 

The report contained eight recommendations call for action to be taken to better protect children at risk of exploitation, and for the agencies involved to develop better systems for sharing information and responding to evidence of exploitation. These recommended actions include:

1. Improving training for professionals and volunteers working with children, so that they can identify warning signs and take appropriate action.

2. Ensuring partners take a ‘no excuses’ approach to protecting children from exploitation.

3. Streamlining processes and systems for sharing information between agencies.

4. Introducing a standardised risk assessment to ensure consistent responses across agencies.

5. Enhancing resources and training for staff working with vulnerable children and young people.

6. Developing communications protocols and mechanisms for partner organisations to better coordinate their responses to exploitation.
