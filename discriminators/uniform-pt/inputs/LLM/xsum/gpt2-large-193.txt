 media, which led the college to open an investigation.

The college, St Andrews, said it was "appalled" to hear from Mr Turner, who was "totally and completely out of touch with today's debates".

It said he had "apparently called a fellow member of this House a n***** on the dance floor whilst discussing a recent speech by a Conservative MP, and that is just not the way in which I think about public life".

A statement from the school said: "Over the last fortnight an undergraduate student from St Andrews College came into contact with the post-graduate student's employer, an educational company, where he expressed sentiments contrary to all that the College and the College, and the College, stand for and on which all students can be counted, take an interest."

The college then said that Mr Turner now had a new job but the university had now opened an investigation into the "discussion and remarks".

The school said Mr Turner will no longer attend the college, citing the "unacceptable and unacceptable behaviour". It said it would work closely with the college to help him complete his degree "with integrity".

The university, which employs a dozen or more staff with no professional qualifications, has now written to Mr Turner, informing him that the comments he made in St Andrews College were "distasteful and intolerable behaviour" and he now "needs to take full responsibility for them".

In a statement, Mr Turner said that "for the sake of the wider debate on the issue," he had taken the "unacceptable and unacceptable behaviour seriously over a few days", adding that he had apologised again "not only to the college but to St Andrews College and to fellow students all over the country".

"I am deeply regretful of the comments I made while at St Andrews College that have brought such misery and ill-will to the college and to the students who work there,"
