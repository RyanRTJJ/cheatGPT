 symptoms among the women who become infected pregnant. It can cause birth defects in babies born to women who catch it while pregnant, including babies with underdeveloped brains. The Zika virus has spread rapidly through the Americas as people travel there. It’s now being spread by mosquitoes in Florida, which is experiencing its second year of a devastating outbreak of the mosquito-borne illness.

Zika causes only symptoms among the women who become infected pregnant. It can cause birth defects in babies born to women who catch it while pregnant, including babies with underdeveloped brains. It may be the leading cause of birth defects in Brazil, and researchers are already calling it the greatest disease threat to the world’s poorest people.
Here's what you need to know about the Zika virus:
1. Zika doesn't just infect people, and it doesn't just have scary birth defects implications, it has been associated with Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes weakness and paralysis.
2. It can be spread by Aedes Aegypti as well as Aedes Albopictus mosquitoes. The name Aedes means “eater of the blood,” and the bite of an Aedes mosquito makes them very desirable to a local culture and to tourists. These mosquitoes tend to prefer living in urban environments, often in close proximity to human dwellings.
3. While the incubation period for Zika is thought to be relatively short (3-7 days), pregnant women should be particularly careful as the virus can be passed from a mother to fetus, and it may cause birth defects. In the past, the effects of Zika have been linked to microcephaly in babies -- if their mothers were pregnant when they were first infected with Zika, they had a 90% chance of giving birth to a baby who was born with a malformed brain and possibly other issues.
4. Most people with Zika, even if they show no symptoms at all, also have a much improved chance of warding off a potentially life-threatening complication called Guillain-Barre syndrome.
5. Because the virus is transmitted via mosquitoes, the only way to prevent Zika is with a bite from Aedes Aegypti, or related mosquitoes. The WHO recommends the following as the best practices
