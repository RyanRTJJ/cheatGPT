 a suspended prison sentence and fined him 50 million yuan.

The announcement that the companies are now cooperating with the government comes after a months-long campaign by US authorities to get foreign companies like GSK and American multinationals to pay closer attention to their dealings in China.

Earlier this year, GSK's Chinese unit agreed to pay out a 722 million yuan fine after being found guilty of illegally promoting the drug Mevacor.

Chinese authorities have a long history of cracking down on corruption in public procurement contracts and other areas. Over the last few years, President Xi Jinfeng has put much emphasis on combating graft, and the issue has gained traction during the ongoing anti-corruption campaign, which has led to the incarceration of senior party members and high-ranking officials. The government has also made an effort to reduce the role of bribery in economic transactions.

GSK CEO Pascal Soriot told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" earlier today, "I think we've taken a hit, but I think it is something that is very isolated and will be a temporary effect."

"I think it would be a mistake, for my part, to jump to any conclusion" regarding the investigation's severity, he added.

GSK said in a statement this morning: "GSK strongly rejects the allegations and has cooperated fully with all the relevant authorities."

"These actions are a result of the actions of a few people, whom we do not condone and who are no longer with the company. The conduct of these individuals does not represent the firm or the thousands of employees around the world who work for it every day."

A Chinese court says GSK's former chairman, John Leach, has been fined 50 million yuan (Â£5.4 million) for corruption-related offences.

The company added that he had been removed as chairman when it learned of the allegations.

China's state media agency Xinhua did not disclose further details on the charges against Leach.

The company said it had received notification of his sentencing on Monday, May 15, before his appointment as chairman of GSK
