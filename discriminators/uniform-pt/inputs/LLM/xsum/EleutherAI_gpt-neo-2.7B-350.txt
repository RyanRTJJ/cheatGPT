 had passed a budget with no tax rise but a £1billion deficit. "Austerity, no tax rise. No tax rise, no government. Now we have got a huge spending programme. When you've got such an austerity programme you have to have a massive spending programme - we're not doing our share."

This led to her making what has become a signature quote. "No-one has a problem at all with extra spending on the NHS." I was pleased to read that the Conservatives want to "keep NHS free at the point of use" rather than "free at the point of delivery". It is a bold approach to reducing spending, as well as being a recognition that the NHS is not ready for a shift toward more consumerism. Will the Tories keep it as a promise?

I wonder whether, when Cameron, Clegg, Osborne, Gove, and their ilk are voted out of their positions, how much the NHS will be seen as a failure, and the message sent to Cameron will be that the NHS is too important to be managed by the state. We will then witness a re-balancing of policy in favour of allowing patients to choose. If the NHS really was too important to the state, we would expect the state to subsidise it, but the state does not expect to provide a service that is so expensive, so large, and so complicated.
