. "At this time I was thinking, 'if she can beat that…' and my mother had a little mantra 'if it keeps going, it keeps going'.” She made it all to October – and then was struck down. Although Sue Miles was given just months to live, she was able to see Marchbank's first performance as the lead, the titular heroine, in the play "Fairy Godmother", directed by Nick Broomfield. (It was to be Marchbank's last theatre production as Sue Miles passed away five years ago in Melbourne.)

Her final act: a visit to the Melbourne premiere of "Anna Karenina" in August 2014. She "loved" it and had an "enormous connection" to the movie. Her favorite thing about the play "was the wonderful way that love grows even when love is all you have, with so much pain, so much sacrifice. There is so much love and devotion and there is even love despite some very bad choices and things are out of your control. All of this is in the play.” During the production: "I was going through some very serious family strife, losing my husband; it was tough for me."

The death was a turning point. Marchbank got together with her two youngest children (both of her sons were also actors) and wrote an anti-bullying piece, a screenplay and a new play. She wrote it based on stories from her four sons and from friends, "not a lot of people talk to their families about what happens – it is very secretive in a lot of ways. But it's a really important part of how I look at things." She wanted to tell the story of how love grows despite tragedy.

The play, "Anna Karenin", was directed by Bruce Beresford in 2014 and stars Sia Williams, and stars Sia Williams playing the title role, the mother of Anna Karenin, who is in love with Dmitry. Sia's performance was a highlight and in between takes Marchbank talks with me about doing the play.

What was the inspiration behind writing a new play?

I really wanted to tell a story where love was a force for good. The story of Anna Karenin, in many ways
