 expectation that ministers will disclose their personal finances".

The Treasury announced in 2013 that it had completed an investigation into financial secrecy, and one of the three senior Lib Dem ministers was warned last year that it would have to reveal its total assets to the public. But in late 2013 there were only nine investigations under review, for which the Treasury's Office of Financial Review was called to take evidence. Although the findings of those audits have been published in numerous papers and have made their way to MPs, they remain classified.

In response, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron pledged in February that he would announce such a review by the end of the year. "The government needs to know very clearly how and where we have been using government work and how it benefits our communities," he said. "Ministers are bound by the Parliamentary Standards Authority's guidance to disclose their financial transactions. They should disclose it to the press, too."

The Lib Dems said it would be a clear breach of confidentiality by the Treasury. "The Treasury should not be able to share information from private companies with Ministers," they said in a statement. "It's time politicians started telling the truth about our government's record of integrity and are giving them credibility in the next parliament with regards to this."

A Treasury spokeswoman said on Wednesday that its review was carried out independently: "While we cannot commit to a definitive report, and the Treasury has published their findings in their complete form, the process of review must be completed quickly. The government expects us to work closely with all parties to ensure it is a truly independent review."

A Treasury spokesman said: "We understand that in the wake of such a big announcement from the Treasury by the Lib Dem leader, he needs this opportunity to make a change. This will provide a clear roadmap for what to do to ensure a fresh start for our businesses that is not to feel disrespected or belittled."

David Miliband, the Labour leader, said he would be willing to help ministers set out details of their decision,
