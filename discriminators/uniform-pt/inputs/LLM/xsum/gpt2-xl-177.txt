4 hours a week, or 34.4 hours each workday.

While those numbers sound daunting, it's actually an improvement from the 35.4 hours per week that the government said teachers would have to work were the contract to be implemented.

In addition to the reduced time of work, some teachers reported finding themselves dealing with issues at home related to fatigue and poor sleep, despite the extra time they spend with students.

More than half of teachers reported that they were struggling with fatigue by the time the school year began; just under a third didn't manage to go a full week without having some kind of personal health crisis related to work, or to the exhaustion the workload created.

More than a third (37 per cent) of teachers reported difficulty sleeping at night; about one in five teachers said it got difficult at some point to stay concentrated throughout the day and often felt they were getting distracted.

And about one in seven parents and children said they did not respect or care about the standards of work of teachers, and one-third reported they frequently wondered about the state of teachers in schools across the country.

What's more, the EIS suggests that, with the implementation of a contract, teachers, principals and heads may face pressure to do fewer hours of work. That's because they would be able to increase the amount of time they spend with students to create a classroom experience of the highest priority â€“ regardless of how much additional work they do.

The report also notes that some elementary schools are already cutting back on class size in response to a lack of funding; this could make the situation worse if the contract is in place. The report states that teachers in the province might have to work only a few hours a day in class to accommodate such a change.

Other provinces have already gone through work-to-rule, meaning they are making it easier to fire teachers without pay, or requiring employees to put in longer hours
