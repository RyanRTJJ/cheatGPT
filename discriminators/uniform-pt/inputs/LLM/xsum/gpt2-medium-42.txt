 at the same time being at least 25% less expensive.

The new painting, which opened to the public today at the Batshefsky Gallery in Stockholm, is created using a combination of red pigment in a process that will last for at least two and a half years using only solar powers. Its original was created in 1998, when Rembrandt left the painter an incredible request.

One of the artists, Christian Ljungqvist of the University of Stockholm, told The Guardian: "Rembrandt asked me to create what he calls the 'Rembrandt of the future'. He wanted to have paintings of men living well, having a strong and healthy relationship with nature, and the art of art is the art of human beings.

"It was an opportunity to change Rembrandt, as he was seen as the artist of the past. I started working with Rembrandt for the first time in 1999 and it was that first painting that became this piece, with the help of oil colouring, computer created projections and a digital projection which looks as if it is being taken on a stage."

Rembrandt was so attracted to the idea of a painting that, in addition to taking great care, he also asked for special attention to certain details in the painting: a light to reflect sunlight reflected off of the ceiling by a solar photovoltaic array; a light source so that the piece can be viewed through skylights to reflect light back off of it; and so on. The original Rembrandt of the future was created using only white paint but the researchers believe that in collaboration with their computer created, oil paint, there is an opportunity to create a "unique Rembrandt" that is 30% more costly, and only one of ten of its works were created by Rembrandt.

According to the research, the computerized projection shows how the pieces can be viewed from the roof of a building
