 victims. The move came after two senior politicians said on Thursday they were quitting the Cabinet after one was the victim of a hate crime.

The new rules were approved by the Commons at a meeting in London on Wednesday night. An early draft would have required Twitter to remove a tweet with just three characters of hate speech in it once a day.

The firm could still decide to suspend a single tweet and then later decide it should not have done so. It could also choose not to delete a tweet that contained just three words but was a clear breach of the rules.

It is understood the firm wants to ensure that only material that is likely to cause offence, and that has actually been reported by the victim of the offence, is removed.

If the rules are published as expected on Friday, they will be enforced within six months, allowing the firms time to set up systems to remove abuse of all types on their platforms. It may well take longer than that. Twitter now has 7.2 million users and has lost many of its stars over abuse, its user-base has also changed dramatically, including the exodus of a large number of journalists.

The new rules are likely to be a test case for how the firm reacts when a hate-speech violation is caught online by officials. Under the proposals, Twitter could have a "kill switch" that would allow it to delete a tweet in the event of reports from users.

Those found to be in breach of the rules could also have their accounts suspended. "We have to strike a balance between freedom of expression and the need to prevent this type of abuse," said Jeremy Hopkins, chief executive of Twitter UK, its commercial arm. "Our mission is to make the world more open, connected and meaningful. As part of that, we recognize that people must feel safe when expressing themselves on Twitter."
