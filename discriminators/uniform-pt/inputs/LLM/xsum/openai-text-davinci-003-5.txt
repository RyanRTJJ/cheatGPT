ithout providing more funding for students.

The legislation had originally set out to make universities accountable for the quality of teaching and learning, so that higher fees could be justified with improved teaching and learning outcomes. However, universities are now able to make changes to courses, courses of study, and teaching approaches without necessarily committing to providing more tuition funding for students. This means that students could end up paying more for courses without any commensurate improvement in the quality of teaching or learning outcomes. 
The legislation was also intended to incentivize universities to develop courses that meet the needs of employers, with the aim of ensuring that students have the necessary skills when they enter the job market. This has also been delayed until 2020-21, meaning that universities are currently not obligated to provide courses that are meaningful to the demands of employers. This could mean that future graduates may enter the job market unprepared or under-qualified for the jobs they need. 

In summary, the intended effects of the higher education legislation are being delayed, leaving universities largely unaccountable for improvements in tuition quality and unable to respond to the needs of employers. This could lead to students paying more for courses that are not of a higher quality, and ultimately leading to more graduates entering the job market without the required skills or qualifications.
