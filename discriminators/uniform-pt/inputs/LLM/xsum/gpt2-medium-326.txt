 six-week-old baby girl, and two girls aged 12 days and under and a seven-month-old girl. A woman in her 80s suffered mild to moderate injuries from gunshots to her abdomen. Two people were hospitalized following the shooting.

A total of three people were arrested on Saturday, all of whom have now been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm. Another 16 people remain in police custody.

At the scene, the city heard a scream and screams of life, then saw blood running in the street.

Police vehicles lined the street at this point, but not everyone in St. Mary's stood still, as they left to get to work on St Vincent Street a few miles away. The first police officers to come on scene were a white police car with an airbag and two ambulances.

The shooting came about one hour after the fatal shooting in east Newtownassin involving a woman who later died. Police initially said that a 38-year-old woman died around 1:30 in the afternoon and later said no one was seriously injured.


"A number of people are said to have received minor injuries while the initial enquiry is ongoing. People living in the area have been warned not to approach this location at this time," police said in a statement after the incident.

Police are continuing to investigate the origins of the shooting, one of which was reported by a witness around 1:30 am.


The car at the heart of the incident was parked in the parking lot of a grocery at the corner of Salthill and New Calingie Gardens.

St. Mary's hospital said that a six-month-old baby girl was among three children who was shot. The other injured child is believed to be a girl.

Police say they think the victims were targeted in order to scare witnesses. They say one person was shot to death while another was shot in the hip. The third person is thought to have received minor injuries as a result of multiple shooting.

The driver of the red police car fled the scene
