 Langmead was arrested.

Officers say three people have been interviewed over the alleged offence.

It is alleged they were seen leaving the restaurant shortly before the glue was used and a witness told police she saw the girls using a spoon on the toilet.

A post office worker at the bank, who heard one of the suspects complain about the glue around 7pm in the pub, and saw it being applied to the toilet seat of a car.

The woman called the police.

The girls, aged 15 were arrested on suspicion of causing bodily harm, after a post office worker saw one of the girls complaining about the glue around 7pm.

A woman who was at McDonald's in High Street with her daughter said the glue was on the toilet seat of a car at 7.30pm.

A police spokesman said: "Officers and a post office employee working at the store at 8.50pm saw a female suspect with a white powder on her finger.

"They looked around for her and found a black plastic bag in the car but the suspect left the car before they arrived."

Police have previously appealed for any witness of any activity in this area, or anyone who saw anything.

Anyone with information can call police on 101 quoting reference 1936 of 7 July or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

A statement from McDonald's has since been released.

It read: "The safety of our customers and employees is a top priority at McDonald's and we were appalled by this incident in our restaurant.

"We believe this product was an innocent accident and the girl was lucky to be unscathed.

"Our restaurant management have spoken with the girl who we are happy to provide support as we support our team members at this time."

The supermarket added that police were "very concerned" and are liaising closely with its owners and business partners.
