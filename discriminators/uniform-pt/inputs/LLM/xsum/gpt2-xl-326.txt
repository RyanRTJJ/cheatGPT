 31-year-old woman in her 40s, a 50-year-old man in his 60s and a 19-year-old girl. Police said four people were critically injured.

A woman (40s) and two women (16 and 17) who have not been named were brought to hospitals in serious condition, while two men and a girl at a private hospital in Carrickmines were also listed as critically injured.

The victims were part of the same family and had gone to the village for the weekend, it was also reported.

Irish Independent/Newstalk ZB quoted a witness as saying: "A black Audi pulled up to the bus stop in the village and someone sat down. Three young ladies were sitting opposite that vehicle. All of them had to be jumped off."

A passerby alerted residents to what was happening.

A senior state pathologist at the scene, Dr Se√°n Hurley, said none of the victims had been hit by a light motor car and none at all by a "heavy car."

Dr Hurley said none of the victims were wearing seatbelts and all of them had been trampled to death on impact.

The Irish Independent said forensic work carried out on the bodies would indicate which direction they appeared to have been traveling when they were killed.

According to the Irish Independent that initial investigation suggests the women had been walking with another group when the crash occurred.

There were also reports of people being taken to A&E to treat minor burns.

The crash occurred as a bus was parked up at the village well for passengers.

Dr Michael O'Rourke, a senior pathologist at St Catherine's Hospital, said the three dead victims were killed instantly.

A garda spokesman said it was understood that the woman and two other men were seriously injured when the Audi swerved and then crashed into them.

He said: "The Audi, described as a newer vehicle - we don't know whether it was a silver Audi or an older model. It was black and silver in colour."

Dr O'Rourke explained the victims had travelled to the village
