 not recognize Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's government.

Brazil will hold two rounds of presidential and parliamentary elections later this year. Its new president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva beat his nearest rival, former Labor Prime Minister Luiz Ito, last month and is expected to win a second term next month.

Brazil's relations with Israel have been tense since both countries were shaken by the 2006 massacre of more than 300 worshippers at an Argentine Jewish community center and the assassination of Israel's military attaché in 2009. There were conflicting reports of who was behind the killing and in what circumstances after police said the attacker was a 17-year old Palestinian who left Brazil on the night of the attack.

In a television interview, Lula said on Friday he would continue to talk peace between Israel and the Palestinians to Israel and the Palestinians.

Dayan, however, said Brazil had no intention of recognizing Israel until the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank decided to follow through with similar actions in neighboring Jordan, which he said would not hurt peace efforts.

Brazil's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the news.

Dayan represented Brazil in both the Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia consulates at the American embassy.

The United States is opposed to recognizing Israel and has urged Israel to stop the West Bank settlements.

Brazil joins Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Panama, Nicaragua and Venezuela in the Latin American grouping CELAC, which supports unilateral Palestinian statehood but not negotiations.
