There was plenty of negative news for the local development team. Last year a court granted an injunction to block all further developments in South Gillingham in a case brought by the developer at the Court of Appeal, a claim that later lost in a high court.

"It's going to be very difficult to get the agreement done," says Mr Deans. But the South Gillingham development team have already signed a memorandum of understanding with the developers, and have started to plan their legal defence. "The issue will eventually come up at another level," explains Mr deans.

Local councillors and locals themselves also have their doubts about the deal. "I am not sure it is safe to build in South Gillingham", says Councillor Mattie Walker.

Even if Dumfries and Galloway County Council agreed not to interfere with the Dumfries-based developer, there are many residents in the South Gillingham area who remain unconvinced.

"If our local people aren't prepared to see the same development coming in, then I think the town hall needs to step in and stop it," said Tom Foslach, a neighbour of the site. At the same time, the development team have had to spend much of the last few months making sure the issue is kept separate from the developer's wider scheme involving an airport in the town of Morwick, to which this property is part.

If there is a conflict, the council still won't go to court under the planning legislation. And when the developer makes its decision, it can still take years to reach an agreement that has nothing to do with planning, but in principle can be negotiated to produce a much better use of the land. The developers intend to use it for an aviation site.

"I think that it's a great development but is that it?" wonders Mrs Wojowski. "I think it's a great development but is it for all the needs of the community?"
