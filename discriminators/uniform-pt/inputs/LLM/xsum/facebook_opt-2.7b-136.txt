“The UK remained on course for a strong run of growth,” said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.

“As with May, most factors continue to support this. The combination of increasing household income growth, buoyant confidence levels and robust household spending underpinned by solid increases in incomes and earnings.

“But the underlying weakness in the labour market continues to constrain demand particularly for lower-skilled labour, and the pick-up in retail sales in particular suggests that some consumer spending may be being driven by households seeking to boost wealth and assets.”

Howard Archer highlighted the construction industry which saw a large increase in building works, up 4.6% in the latest figures. Growth in the manufacturing sector continued to lift, increasing by 1.0% at the headline rate.

The manufacturing industry has become increasingly upbeat about its prospects for the rest of the year, as strong demand in Europe and the Far East boosted the balance sheets of firms across many sectors.

“We look for the manufacturing sector in particular to continue to post strong growth levels over the rest of 2013,” Archer added.

“Although manufacturing has enjoyed a tailwind this year, with the euro zone now recovering and strong demand from emerging Asia, we expect it to decline towards the first half of next year.”

The service sector, which accounts for around 70% of the UK economy, saw growth accelerate again in May, with growth in retailing rising as shoppers spent more on new cars, furniture and clothes.

The number of people on payrolls also rose, with over 330,000 people, as firms hired staff to meet demand in the booming trade and tourism sectors.

Analysts from Barclays believe that the UK’s recovery in the first quarter is set to continue:

“As we look forward to 2Q13, we see upside risks to our June GDP projection, particularly as momentum in the labour market remains strong. We now expect growth of 0.5% (0.4% in Q1 13) as the growth in real GDP is boosted by strong household spending (+0.7%) and business investment (+0.4%). We also expect the unemployment rate to
