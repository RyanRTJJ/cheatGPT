y repeated requests for evidence and later, inadequate and repeated reassessments.

The pair's claims were supported by a disability charity, who say that the government's current system of reassessing people's disability benefits is ineffective, causing delays and stress for claimants. The charity cited research indicating that nearly three out of four PIP claimants who were reassessed had their benefits cut or stopped altogether. 

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has responded by saying that 85% of first time PIP claimants receive an award and that reassessments are necessary to ensure claimants have access to the right benefit in the right amount. It has also defended its action against loan sharks, saying that it has launched a nationwide campaign called "Stop Loan Sharks."

However, disability campaigners and charities point out that the system needs to be reformed in order to reduce the waiting time for PIP reassessments and ensure that people who have legitimate needs for support continue to receive adequate benefits. Activists are calling for increased support for claimants, including improved advice about claiming benefits, and more training and support for reassessment staff. They are also urging the government to improve its communications with claimants and provide appropriate support for disabled people in navigating the PIP system.
