 are also in high demand and are becoming more difficult to find and stock.

Now, a German researcher has developed a unique solution that he says uses one-fifth the amount of insecticide for the same effect. He won’t put his research on the market for another year, until the FDA rules on a product based on his idea and he gets it cleared for public release.

What’s the problem?

Travelling to Latin America and other Asian countries is one of the top ways that the insect population in hotels is increasing – and at an alarming rate, the new report said.



According to the report by the European Tourism Agency (ETAs) – the tourism market for Latin America is growing at a faster rate than Canada, Mexico, Australia and the US combined – Asia is “the most preferred region in the world for tourists,” a study confirmed last month.

The insect’s population increases four folds to 20-25 million people each year.

According to the report, a large part of the problem is the use of pyrethrin, the active ingredient in insecticides to control bugs. Although it has been in use for decades, in recent years there have been several cases in the media that it has been implicated in allergic reactions. At least one member of the American Academy of Dermatology recently urged American companies to review all their pyrethrin samples.

“Not one time has pyrethrin caused an allergic reaction in any of its users,” said the academy’s president, Dr. Edward Yap. “But it has been used for the past 40 years with no issues.”

In fact, a 2012 report – which did not include data from Latin America – showed the insecticide to be perfectly safe. A spokesman for the European Environment Agency told ET: “What I know is this kind of insecticides are being used and have been used for more than 100 years without problems.”

One of the main reasons the insect population is
