 Police in London was designed and delivered by Upsi. The goal was to prove that "CopCats are real, you can see them everywhere and they're very effective, at catching suspects." During the trial, police officers stood in unmarked vehicles, and if a cyclist or runner was in view they would give a short warning (e.g. "That's a Copcat" or "Freeze, I'm a police officer") and then the officers would use a megaphone so that the motorbike would warn the target.

Each police officer was equipped with a video camera (similar to a standard police dash cam) mounted on the helmet visor and a microphone which allowed the officer's voice to be spoken back to the cyclist or runner. If the target (or any people who could hear the voice) acknowledged that they understood that they were being warned by Copcat (by waving or by moving to show agreement), then they were given their phone back and the officers would move on. In total, there were 12 of these trial days.

The #Copcat trial was conducted over a 3-month period from December 2016 to January 2017, during which the trial days in each borough of London were conducted on consecutive Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. In total, there were over 1,000 police officers conducting the trials, as well as 6,000 cyclists and 3,500 joggers who were subjected to the warnings. In addition, some of the police officers wore black or yellow hard hats, and some of the officers also wore a fluorescent yellow shirt, to help make them more visible to cyclists and runners.

Over 1,400 of the 1,611 people who got their phone confiscated, were "given their phone back" and were also given $10 in £7.20 "credit vouchers". On average, the police confiscated approximately 1,000 phones by bike on each of the three trial days. In the first month the phones that the police confiscated by bike had an average value of £50 ($65) and an average weight of 825g.
