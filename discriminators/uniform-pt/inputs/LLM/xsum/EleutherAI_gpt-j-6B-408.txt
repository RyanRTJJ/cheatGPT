Alan Massie said he was "in the process of getting my act together" but he did not want to give an indication of when his "inappropriate behaviour" towards his ex-wife had taken place.

The case was dealt with in Edinburgh Sheriff Court after a complaint from Nicola Massie on August 12, 2013.

She complained against Mr Massie, whom she met when they both worked for the civil service and separated in 2003, saying that he was 'in the process of getting his act together'.

Sheriff Andrew McLaughlin deferred the case so it could be heard on a date of Mr Massie's choice.

'I was deeply ashamed and ashamed for Nicola'.

Mr Massie added that he had been in a relationship with her before she met him, and that a previous girlfriend had'made up' the story to try to ruin his career.

"When my current relationship with Nicola ended, I had recently broken up with the previous girlfriend," he explained. "

"I went through a period of deep depression where I drank too much and could no longer remember details about what I had been doing or who I had been seeing.

"I also felt terribly guilty that I had not been truthful with my girlfriend at the time of our break-up. When I told her what had happened, she accused me of lying to her after they had been together for seven years.

"Not only was it untrue but I had just found out I was going to be a grandfather. I was devastated because I was sure it's what she would choose to do given their time together had been 'good'. That was why I had not told her about the girl I thought she was referring to, she had not been told but I was sure she would have chosen not to stay with me if she had known about her."
