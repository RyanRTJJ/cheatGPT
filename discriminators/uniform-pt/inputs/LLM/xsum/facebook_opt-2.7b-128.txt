 workers had not known the full circumstances of her death and that their failings 'could have contributed to her death'.

A coroner's inquiry into the ten-year-old's death is to be held today.

Miss Burke was attacked by Nicholson as she was alone at home in Newcastle in the run-up to Christmas.

She was found in the street with a fractured skull, blood pouring from her head and had been badly burned.

Nicholson, who denies murder, is due to stand trial at Newcastle Crown Court before Lord Justice Leveson.

Northumbria Police discovered Ms Burke's mother - who is suffering from terminal cancer - was being sexually abused by Nicholson in her flat by the time she reported the abuse to social services.

The family had been referred to social services and, shortly after, social workers in a specialist team started to investigate Nicholson and his former relationship with Burton's mother.
