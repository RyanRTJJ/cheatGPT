Meanwhile, Sinn Féin will have a one-seat UUP-led executive at Stormont, having lost its seat in a by-election.

There were some changes to the composition of the four UUP MLAs that had made a comeback two weeks ago, when party leader Niloán Ó Muilleoir was also forced into the cabinet.

Mr Ó Muilleoir was appointed as finance minister for six months by the DUP - the same cabinet that also has an Alliance-led executive in place. The move means the UUP is in opposition to the Irish government in office.

However, it may not be for many months as both the Ulster Unionist and Unionist Alliance parties are in coalition government together for some time and could easily find enough support for their government to keep the UUP intact.

Mr Ó Muilleoir is believed to have informed his UUP colleagues this morning.

However, a senior DUP source confirmed to Independent.ie that the party is continuing to prepare to field an independent candidate in the seat of Antrim, at the expense of the current UUP candidate.

He added that Sinn Féin's decision to bring into coalition with the DUP risks undermining the UUP's position in Antrim by reducing its representation.

Asked about the possible prospects for the UUP's future in Antrim, a senior DUP source said this morning, "It's possible, a great big possibility."

Mr Ó Muilleoir is understood to have informed his rivals in the party's ruling body that he wants them all to return to Stormont.

UUP leader Gerry Adams was unimpressed with the prospect of Alliance-led unionism governing the province.

He said last night that unionist parties had a huge job of uniting behind a common set of principles. "How can unionism govern a province where there is no union to govern it under, or a single party to govern?"

Mr Ó Muilleoir said he believes that once the current UUP administration has been formed, it would be impossible for such a thing to happen again.
