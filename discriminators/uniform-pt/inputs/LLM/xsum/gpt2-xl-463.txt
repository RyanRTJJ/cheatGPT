eiros, a nurse infected with the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia.

Both women, from Boston and Dallas, were flown back to the US on Monday following their release from the Belgrade jail.

The pair had been at the centre of a diplomatic row between Serbia and the US after the two women were detained on suspicion of attempting to bring Ebola to the country, despite assurances made on both sides, including from Barack Obama, that they were not at risk of the deadly virus.

The US had demanded their immediate release, arguing that the women could not be held in isolation as they were American citizens and that their own medical condition was of no relevance to the case.

Serbia, however, had maintained that the two nurses, who had both treated American victims of the Ebola virus, could not be kept in a sanitary condition.

Both women were being kept at Belgrade's High Secession Hospital, but had been moved to a small private room with their belongings and were not given sufficient rest and fluids during the night. The hospital has not issued a statement following their release.
