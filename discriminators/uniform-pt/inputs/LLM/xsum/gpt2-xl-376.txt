 Rowan Marshall remains out.

South Africa lost 12-6 on debut to England at Twickenham but with the Lions tour in September, they have an 18-match home series against Argentina and South Africa â€“ their first test in South Africa since 2005.

"It's great for us, it's great for the players. The Lions is the longest tour of the summer and hopefully it sets our fans over the next 10 months in good mood," said Lions coach Warren Gatland.

"We are very pleased from the Lions in Ireland how the crowd have turned out.

"The atmosphere is amazing and the atmosphere at Old Trafford [where Scotland played Wales and New Zealand this autumn], it's a great atmosphere. They just go at us with the enthusiasm of a side that's playing every week.

"There's an amazing buzz within the crowd the way they're playing."

South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer acknowledged Williams' suspension, adding: "It's obviously a relief for the team for them being here in this moment of adversity [with the Lions tour] and it is good that they are here."

Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall added: "It's a great result, a great point for us given that we were really close to getting through but couldn't do it. We have got to take care of ourselves in this period coming back and get on with it."

Scarlets boss Warren Gatland added: "It's huge for us, a very important point in the second test.

"We are looking forward to the series against South Africa and the opportunity to play good rugby and be a real challenge and hopefully help change perceptions around rugby in the UK."

The win means Harlequins' defeat to Bath at Twickenham had a greater bearing on the result than their loss to Saracens. The former won the final at Twickenham and was awarded a bonus point with the score at 30-0, while the latter was kicked out of the contest when Saracens won a penalty in extra time.
