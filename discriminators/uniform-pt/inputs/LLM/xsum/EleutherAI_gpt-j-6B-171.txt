Dermot won and joined the judging line-up

In news that delighted music fans, Dermot was unveiled as the new host of The Voice, while Sharon took over as presenter of Let It Shine, for a second series.

In the announcement, Radio 2 controller Sean Tyas said the programmes “mark a new era for the BBC after Ofcom delivered a licence fee settlement that shows the highest annual licence fee increase since 2010”.

And the two shows are the first time that the BBC’s big summer shows have not included the Corporation’s big rival, ITV.

Mr Tyas added: “Dermot’s voice has gone around the world for many years.

"Let It Shine offers more of the same, but with a few extras thrown in, including live performances from other artists.

“As the only British singing show in the world, the only one without any live bands, we have decided that it is time to bring something extra to all our audiences – they deserve that.”

Meanwhile, Let It Shine has been given a bumper budget for a second series, with it set to feature £800,000 per show this year, compared to £600,000 for the first series, with one show each week for 10 weeks.

A spokeswoman said: “The Voice has proven to be the most popular music series on TV.

"We're thrilled that we can give viewers even more of the same with Let It Shine, by giving Sharon Jones the chance to bring her unique brand of soul and gospel music from the stage to the studio.”

In a first, this year’s Voice will see three former contestants in the competition compete on the spin-off, with this “sing-off” featuring previous winners Danny Glover, Gok Wan and Tom Jones, who all featured in the 2011 series.
