 cancelled at Stansted, the airport authority said in a statement.

Ryanair’s service to Stansted has been partially suspended, the airline told The Guardian, as well as flights to London City and Luton airports.

There are around 150 flights cancelled.

The AA has advised motorists to check the traffic information before setting out for London this morning.

Earlier this week, the Government said that it was introducing emergency legislation to give the Department for Transport powers to control the situation to protect passengers, and urged people to check the travel advice before setting out for work.

On Thursday the airline’s parent company, IAG, made a profit of 25.4m euros in the fourth quarter of the year.

IAG reported a net profit during the quarter of 25.4m euros (£22.3m) and posted increased activity at its Irish low-cost subsidiary Aer Lingus after it acquired an 89 per cent stake in its Irish airline.

On the company’s results announcement, chief executive Tony Tyler said the company’s continued strength was down to cost control.

“The company’s focus on operational discipline and efficient management means that revenues and margins are set to be very strong for the rest of the year,” he said.

Tyler commented: “It has been a very good year for low-cost airlines as traffic volumes and fares have bounced back strongly from very low levels last summer and this is now creating profitability in European airlines.”

IAG also announced in its accounts that it had made a net profit of 8.3m euros in the six months to 31 December.

It reported an increase in net assets of 0.2bn euros compared to the corresponding period in 2011, with the rise down to 8.6 per cent in the six months to 31 December.

A subsidiary of IAG, Aer Lingus had operating profit of 40.5m euros in the third quarter of the year.
