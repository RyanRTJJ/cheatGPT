 A few months later, his relatives said, they had heard about a family reunion and discovered that a man from Makedona, an eastern Croatian town 40 kilometers away, was Marija's husband.

But because they lived in different regions of their hometown, there was confusion as to what happened before they met as children 40 years ago.

"I knew it — it's not a big problem," said Marianna Zlatic. "I will be dead by the time the reunion will be held."

The Serbian and Croatian governments insist the agreement is effective, despite an agreement to stop the practice in Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary. The United Nations Human Rights Office said it had received reports of executions — one of which was documented in a photograph of Marija Zlatic — and others of men being forced to become sex slaves and their bodies being returned to families unknown.

"I don't take into account the issue of women's safety when assessing this situation," Human Rights Watch wrote in a recent report.

Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic has said the practice will end as soon as it is found to be a violation of international law. "You have to find a way for it to end," he said. "This is totally unacceptable."

The Croatian government says it will prosecute those who perpetrate executions or assist them. Serbia, which has not signed the agreement, has refused to take any measures against those who assist or carry out the executions, including by providing the means.

Krisztina Ivanovic-Jevtic, deputy director of the government's Ministry of Justice, said women from the southeast region have been coming to the ministry from Bosnia and Herzegovina to report that their husbands or brothers had died and asking that they be freed from being separated from their families.

"We've been hearing this for almost 20 years. In the past four months we've seen four cases," she said. Authorities in neighboring Bosnia are aware of the phenomenon.
