 still convinced the Mercedes team is to blame for not being able to match it to Mercedes.

Lewis, like Hamilton, believes it was better for Mercedes to spend the summer in the pre-season testing cycle, which they do each year - even if the German company, for the first time in its history, cannot afford to spend too much time in F1 in 2014.

"So it was a bit disappointing but we'll just go on that. I'm sure we'll do a better job next year."

Hamilton said Hamilton thought his side failed to take full advantage of Mercedes' strength at this point last season.

"When you're in the starting grid for so many races, sometimes you do feel good around a couple of them, but that was always before we became fully confident in all aspects of the car," Hamilton said.

"And we didn't get any opportunities. We ran some good races by running our best cars, but we let ourselves down. I think a couple of factors - which isn't easy to understand - and let's call it like it is, and that's what we're going to concentrate on this weekend."
