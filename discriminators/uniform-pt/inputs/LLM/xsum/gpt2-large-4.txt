 drug use.

Singer Riz Ahmed had also been scheduled to perform, but pulled out before the concert was confirmed. He had previously performed at the 2017 festival.

In November, New York Senator Chuck Schumer called for tighter restrictions on electronic cigarettes and also introduced legislation that would ban the sale of them in New York. Under the bill, manufacturers could face a $10,000 fine and up to two-year's of imprisonment.

The ban would have applied to any brand of electronic cigarettes, but not just a single particular one by a specific company. The legislation would have only affected sales by e-cigarettes to minors, not the sale of such products to adults. New York state is still working on a version of its e-cigarette bill after more than a year.

In February, the FDA was still reviewing the new electronic cigarette ingredients, according to a spokeswoman. Electronic cigarette manufacturers are still allowed to sell the additives they have. The FDA is expected to make a final ruling on e-cigarettes later this year.

Earlier this month, The American Heart Association suggested that electronic cigarettes could help smokers quit smoking by "improving their chances of sustaining an effective cessation program." The group noted that, "most electronic cigarettes have low levels of nicotine and a much shorter toxic exposure profile than traditional cigarettes."

Last month, some e-cigarette manufacturers announced that they would be pulling out of the e-cigarette industry.

Vapor2.0, a vapor delivery company, said it will stop selling e-liquids for its devices, including E-CIGS, the products are no longer sold in retail stores. The vaping company will sell its e-liquids only online via authorized vendors.

Other brands are now likely to follow. A new e-cigarette manufacturer was recently unveiled, which could mean that many of the manufacturers that pulled out of the e-cigarette business are now in the process of selling off their e-cigarettes.

The FDA, however, has not yet announced any potential regulations for either the e-cigarettes or e-liquid manufacturers.

In the United States, e-cigarettes are available for adult use.
