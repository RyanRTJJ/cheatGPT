 of a former water mill that closed in 1992.

A report to the Scottish Government claimed that in 2010, only 15% of UK hydro-electric power generated came from Scotland – the rest comes from Wales.

The current Scottish government, and the Scottish National Party more broadly, is committed to maintaining the status quo, and increasing UK energy consumption – so there are no plans to implement this scheme.

A plan to build an off-shore wind farm in Argyll and Bute, however, would see a significant number of turbines built on the seabed.

The site is one of the most important marine wildlife hotspots on the west of Scotland – it's home to the rare bottlenose dolphin and harbour porpoise.

The first three of the six planned wind turbines were installed in 2015, with a new project due to begin construction later this year.

In a report last year, environmental groups warned that there would be a "ripple effect" of offshore drilling in Scotland's waters, leading to further environmental damage and "greater risk of serious environmental accidents".

In the wake of the Piper Alpha disaster off the coast of Greenland in 1990, the Scottish Government set up an independent board to monitor the safety of offshore drilling in Scottish waters, and has held an update every five years since the mid-1990s.

A new review has found that there are no plans in place to extend the board's remit (despite a recommendation by the Scottish Executive in a December 2014 review).

There has also been a huge increase in the number of oil and gas wells off the east coast of Scotland.

An analysis of Scottish offshore drilling data found that in the 11 years up until 2014 – between April 2001 and March 2012 – 12,800 wells were drilled off the west coast, compared to 15,100 wells in the UK as a whole.

It's thought that the new project off the north coast of Argyll and Bute is a "drop" in the ocean of wells to come across Scotland.

Oil and gas production in the British Isles has been in decline for over 10 years, with a 20% drop in production in 2015/16 alone.
