 ever touched the screen," said Yelena, 42. "It became clear that we were not compatible anymore."

Their split comes just as US President Donald Trump is attempting to crack down on Russian influence in politics - a battle he won. "As a businessman, we had always felt that you and Russia were like cousins," Yelena added.

However, the couple later rekindled their relationship and are now living amicably in London.

In an interview with the BBC in October 2016, Yelena said it was "difficult but not impossible" for her and Boris, 67, to have "a happy relationship".

"It looks complicated. However, we manage to make up on the phone. I live in the UK, Boris lives in Russia," Yelena told the UK broadcaster.

The couple began dating in 1987 and married in 1992. They have two grown-up children - a daughter, Anna Pavlovna, 29, and a son, Alexander, 28.

Despite their split, Yelena told Russian broadcaster RT that they remained "friends and business associates."

"I have always taken care of his house in Moscow," she said. "And I also have a big apartment in a London high-rise."

She denied she was seeking revenge for their divorce. "My intention is to return to Russia. I have many friends there, my children grew up there."

The British Foreign Office, responding to a request from the BBC, issued the following statement: "We don't routinely comment on the relationships of British citizens. However, these are complex issues that involve a range of legal, social and personal considerations."
