 both the club's fans and the FA about what had been said.

The blue shirt is the first time Manchester United's first team have been known as the Red Devils since the club, then known as the Manchester United Football Club, were renamed United in 1946.

But as soon as United's season finished, the club's shirt changed back from red to blue - this time for the 2018-19 season.

"As soon as you get used to it, it's comfortable and you appreciate what you've got," said former England defender Gary Neville. "The blue shirt is actually one of the better ones.

"It's the best home shirt, I think, for our first team. It sets an example to the boys that are playing in it that they should respect the brand. We've got to be aware that it's a big brand out there at the end of the day."

United also unveiled a new away kit, with Adidas using the same blue template as the new home kit as part of a six-year deal.

There was not much difference between the two - though the away shirt was slightly smaller than the one worn at Old Trafford last season.

"I think the away strip is one from last season with a different template," Neville added. "Now it looks a bit fresher than it did when we played against a certain other team."

The Adidas sponsorship deal - for 15 years - means the club have secured the brand's position as the most-recognised and successful in the world of sports retail, and has helped grow their brand global.

United's kit supplier sponsors Adidas has been with United for 30 years.
