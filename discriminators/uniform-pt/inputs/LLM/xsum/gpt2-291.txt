 harmless to humans. But they were also extremely angry. On top of that, their use of this herb turned their stomachs in on themselves, according to the researchers.

In other words, they thought, eating onions might be the answer to their most common allergy. And they thought it might also be important.

"When I heard the news about the study and the research in this field, I was very skeptical," Baudine says. "I thought, 'Wait a sec. What's this?'"

Then in February 2015, she started looking at the onion study and how it might affect other people who are allergic to it. The results of the study, she says, gave rise to "the very thought of people who are using this herb as a therapy for their allergy. â€¦ That was very exciting to me."

The first trial involved 250 people with no known allergies, according to their data. The researchers followed their subjects who suffered from a similar condition but no known allergy. They gave them a placebo, followed by food with a high level of sodium, and then, after five weeks, their health began to improve. (The researchers added that because the researchers didn't want to compare their subjects' behavior to those of their peers, they chose to compare their subjects to those of people with some of the same allergies. "I don't care who the participants are," they say.)

The researchers conducted the second study. Their study included 250 people with low back pain who used this herb as an adjunct to their treatment of back pain. On the evening of the first study, they ate their food twice a day and were given a low dose of a drug to treat their back pain for five weeks. On the end of that treatment, the pain disappeared. At the beginning of the study, people with a pain tolerance disorder were more comfortable eating their meals on a regular basis.

After the first study, people with a disorder similar to Baudine's had similar levels of food
