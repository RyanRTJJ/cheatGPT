Background

Ivy Atkin died in her sleep on 3 November 2012 at an NHS hospital in Nottingham.[2] She had been a resident of Nottingham's home for people with dementia, Autumn Grange, for 17 years. Her brother, Robert Atkin, also had dementia, as did the carers he hired to look after her. The couple, she and Robert's daughter, lived in the care home, as did Robert's partner, the former carer, Ann Harrison and her partner of 16 years, Yousaf Khan.[3] On 3 July 2010 Robert died of pneumonia. Soon after his death, Atkin's daughter, Rosie, complained to the Care Quality Commission about the house that they visited daily. She wrote “I am really saddened to have to say, as both my brother and I do each week, that this care home is not up to standard...We just wish it could be done better”.[4] The CQC was not notified of another inspection by the CQC until 14 June 2012.

During the last days of her life, Atkin received around-the-clock care at Nottingham University Hospital's dementia centre. She was diagnosed there with pneumonia on 26 September; a day after doctors at Nottingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital discharged her.[2] She died at Nottingham City Hospital at 6:35am on 3 November. She had had a liver transplant three years previously.[2][4]

Robert and his partner, Harrison, who also lived at Autumn Grange, had bought it in 2002. Prior to that Harrison’s sister, Linda Thompson, and Atkin lived there as a care home when Harrison and Robert were in hospital. Atkin's daughter, sister and nephew joined her there in 2008, when Atkin was 76-years-old. Thompson's brother, her sister and her mother lived with them. Prior to October 2010, three of Atkin's carers had been in hospital. On 25 October 2010, Khan was convicted
