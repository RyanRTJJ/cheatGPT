 wakeup call to all of us", adding, "there's a lot of work to do." While the Tories claimed the election was a referendum on globalisation, with Theresa May claiming: "We've taken a decision to take our business out of the EU."

Theresa May: "We've taken a decision to take our business out of the EU."

The Independent's Brexit Secretary David Davis said that even though the vote had not been a "referendum on Brexit", the UK's exit would become clearer with the arrival of the new president next month. Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4's Today: "People will start to see what will be going on in terms of the new relationship that may be formed with Europe."

GETTY The poll was held as Britain marked the one year anniversary of the Brexit vote

The poll was seen as a foretaste of things to come with the President-elect facing the first cabinet meeting a day after his inauguration. It was a poll of 1,002 UK adults which asked "Does the UK's exit from the European Union affect you personally?". Over 50% of people said it did, while 37% said it did not. A majority of 53% said it hadn't changed their views, while 34% said it had.

AP The President-elect has been heavily criticised for his climate change and climate science scepticism

It is believed that only 6% of 1,002 are believed to be Labour voters, with only 2% Liberal Democrat voters. Mr Trump has previously boasted of his scepticism on climate change and his desire to "cancel" the Paris Climate Agreement. In one tweet he wrote, "I will be asking Congress to approve the sale of vast amounts of new nuclear power plants.....to China, Japan and other nuclear power countries instead of us." He has even gone as far as claiming climate change is a Chinese hoax, with Mr Trump telling a rally in November: "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive." The survey is one of a number of opinion polls conducted alongside the EU referendum.
