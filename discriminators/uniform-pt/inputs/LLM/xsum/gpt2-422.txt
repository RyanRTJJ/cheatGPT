 get expensive for many small and mid-size hotels. They cost more than $100 a shot.

But despite the risks, insects are not the main cause of hospital admission. Infections such as Staphylococcus aureus can be prevented in the absence of adequate attention to their natural predators.

But in other parts of the world, insect bites can be fatal. The most recent case of hospital admissions with a severe complication occurred in Indonesia in 2012, after two people lost their lives while hitchhiking two people trying to escape a mosquito bite while they were away.

In Thailand that year, eight dead travelers died when a "straw man" slipped away after getting stuck in a tree near Anomali.

"Treat them well, don't try to avoid them," said Aungkum, an insect control scientist with the Department of Biomedical Conservation's Center for Insect Protection. "All these diseases often kill by hanging, if they're not treated properly."

But in Indonesia, most stings are fatal in the form of the "dent bites" that can be seen at Bangkok metro stations on Monday and Tuesday. The bugs are not quite as common as in other parts, but sometimes they have killed more people than any other type of animal.

In a 2013 study, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed that "the most powerful insecticides used in tropical forests may be deadly."

But insects kill themselves and other insects. But in countries such as South Africa, insects kill less than people. Insecticides are widely used in restaurants, hotels, transportation, grocery stores, and office buildings.

A third of all deaths resulted from insects like flies and mites, according to a December report by the Environmental Health Law Institute, now part of the European Union.

While some insects cause hospitalization, other pests usually are the cause of hospitalizations, especially in areas where people live, as many people also eat insects such as aphids, mites, spiders and moths in large burrows and gardens.

This year, there were
