 report's conclusions, published on its website and carried in a special supplement of the New York Times, included:

Iran’s test indicates that missiles it claims to have developed will be capable of reaching Europe and the United States. Iran’s ability to acquire a long-range nuclear-capable missile is a threat to its neighbors but also to Iran itself.

Diversion of the test may have been intended to avoid detection, U.S. intelligence indicates, but the timing suggests covert opposition to Iran. U.S. intelligence is not yet sure whether Iran tried to conceal this event, or if it merely wanted to minimize its risks, its own security as well as the risk of an unprovoked attack.

Iran’s test of a long-range missiles with a range of more than 3,000 kilometers appears to violate the terms of the JCPOA and is thus a severe break with previous commitments. While the U.S. has used sanctions to pressure Iran to abandon its ambitions, the JCPOA may offer Tehran a potential opportunity to continue to develop nuclear-capable missiles.

The JCPOA limits Iran’s civilian nuclear programs in return for relief from sanctions, but does not prohibit Iran from developing ballistic missile technology or its ability to enrich uranium to the level needed for the development of a nuclear bomb. The agreement’s own terms also do not limit Iran’s missile activities, since they are not used for nuclear-weapons fuel.

The report said Iran had already violated its commitment to put a halt to missile production and testing before the next tests — though the tests were not publicly announced — and that the tests in recent months were far more extensive than previously carried out.

It said, "It is inconceivable that Iran can carry out similar tests over the next couple of years without detection or interruption."

The New York Times is not publishing details about Iran's nuclear test.

The JCPOA did not prohibit civilian enrichment work, and indeed Tehran was in the process of developing new gas centrifuges and building a plant to enrich uranium to 20% purity.

Its testing of ballistic missiles and long-range rockets, the
