2014, up 4.5 per cent from 2013/2014.

"We have seen a rise in the number of small business owners in our sector, despite the low incomes we face for all types of business," said Dr Pritchard, who chairs Visit Wales during a two-day conference at the Wales Institute of Technology. "This year has been quite a bit of a rollercoaster for small business owners. From the start £17.5m in profit fell to £5.1m last year. This year is particularly notable that the rise we have seen has been by a large margin."

A survey from the group of UK businesses published last year found that only 6.2 per cent of private sector work did not involve the workforce. "A large part of the shift is from full-time, long term work, that has to be undertaken over five years or more, resulting in a small number of employees," says Prof Pritchard. "The overall workforce participation rate is at 20 per cent."

Some businesses, such as the Bank of England, have had to scale back work to provide long-term employees. The Bank's new policy of £3.6bn in 2011 is expected to see some of this investment taken up by a range of smaller businesses. "The Bank will give more support to small businesses for a number of years and this will enable them to invest long-term."

It's unclear whether this comes as a surprise to the private sector. The head of the UK's largest small business body, the Government's Institute for Strategic Investments, has described it as "one of the most profitable industries in the planet".

Mr Whelan said: "In a typical year across the UK, there were about 25,000 small business vacancies. The proportion of the workforce being represented is much higher. By contrast, at £3.6 billion on the whole, private sector workers have just 11.6 per cent of the total workforce, down slightly from 15.5 per cent in a year earlier. Most of the workforce is being represented by small firms. I will continue to support small business and we are doing so for all of us."
