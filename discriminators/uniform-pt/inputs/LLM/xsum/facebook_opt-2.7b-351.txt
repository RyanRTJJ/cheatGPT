 had a huge effect on his family and our lives. He was a family man who was loved by his children and grandchildren."

The attack took place in Bolton town centre shortly after 10pm on Sunday. Police officers arriving at the scene saw a car having rolled over into a yard and its occupants running away from the car.

Samwell was seen attempting to force his way back through the car park where the car had ended up, so the thieves – a woman and a man – could drive away in the car. In an attempt to stop him, Samwell was knocked backwards, and suffered serious head injuries. He died later in hospital.

A 38-year-old man and a 33-year-old man were detained nearby and arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and attempted robbery. The 28-year-old woman remained at large on Monday.

DCI Mark Thompson, who led the investigation, said Samwell's family would be offered support by specially trained officers.

"Anyone with information about the incident and the suspects involved will be treated with the utmost professionalism and sensitivity. We would urge anyone who knows who the suspects are to speak to police."

The incident comes two days after a father of three was killed in a knife attack in Clapton, west London, when he tried to stop his teenage son from stabbing another man. Tariq Ali, 38, who had moved from Ghana six years ago, suffered a serious double-stabbing.

The prime suspect, a 17-year-old, has been jailed for life. The teenager will serve at least 10 years at a young offenders' institution and also get a "significant" financial compensation. It could take 10 years to pay the compensation, which was calculated using the maximum sentence a young person could face.

It follows a dramatic police operation. Hours before Ali's death, police arrested a man who attacked a woman in her 50s on another road. He is currently being held in custody on suspicion of murder.
