 then blackmailed with the promise of the images being made public.

Sextortion is a form of extortion in which victims are coerced into performing sexual acts or providing sexual images, in exchange for money or the promise of not showing those images to others. It often involves offenders using threats and coercion, such as threatening to release personal information or pictures to the public.

In the case of Daniel Perry, he was targeted by someone who pretended to be a female on social media. They tricked him into engaging in a video chat, and when he realised it was a scam, they threatened to post the video online unless he sent large sums of money.

Daniel tragically took his own life to prevent the video from being released. Sadly, this kind of crime is becoming increasingly prevalent, with the Office for National Statistics recently reporting that “cyber-flashing” is the most common form of sextortion in the UK.

The best way to protect yourself from sextortion is to be aware of the risks associated with engaging in online activity. You should never share personal information or photos with someone you don’t know, and never send money to someone who demands it. If you find yourself in a situation where you are being threatened or blackmailed, it’s essential that you contact the police as soon as possible.
