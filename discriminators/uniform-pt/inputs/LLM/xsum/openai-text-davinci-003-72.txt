rayling has said that the money will go towards building stations, improving existing transport links and refurbishing old stations.

The proposed station in Ilkeston is expected to be built near the main line between Sheffield and Nottingham stop at East Midlands Parkway. The new station is part of a larger plan to improve transport links between East Midlands and the wider region, which includes Sheffield, the railfreight hub of the region, the cities of Nottingham and Sheffield, and huge residential areas.

The station will have two platforms, an expanded car park, a cycle storage facility and CCTV security. A train can be expected to pass through the station on an hourly basis, connecting Ilkeston with Sheffield and Nottingham.

The new station also promises significant benefits to the people of Ilkeston in terms of reduced journey times, as it will reduce the time to travel to Sheffield or Nottingham by train. Improved transport links will also benefit tourism and business in the area.

The money from the fund is expected to cover the majority of the costs, with local authorities expected to contribute their own financial support towards the remainder. The council is currently seeking additional funding for the project from other sources, such as the European Regional Development Fund.

The exact timeline for the project is as yet unknown, although it expected to be completed within three to five years.
