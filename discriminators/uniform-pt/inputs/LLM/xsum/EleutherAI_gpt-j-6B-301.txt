If I had to pick the worst place I’ve ever been, it would have to be a shelter where nobody wants to talk about it.

On Thursday, the shelter system in the North West region had an occupancy rate of 99 per cent. You can argue with the stats, but it’s still a lot of people who need space, but who might not have used one in a while.

A new shelter was announced last week, in what seemed like a timely announcement because of the impending change in the weather — in this case, to minus 10 Celsius — and a system struggling to keep everything running.

That shelter, however, was far from a warm, supportive space for anyone, like the one described by a survivor. It seems like shelter operators are learning the hard, slow way that no matter how good you are, somebody out there will hate you for it.

The most urgent need right now is housing

A shelter operator at a smaller shelter in Sault Ste. Marie said the most urgent need in the shelter system right now is providing housing for homeless women who need immediate help to get off the streets.

Shelter operators have to work with all levels of government to provide options for people who are truly homeless, with or without children. They look for a mix of options; if a family is willing to be housed, they try to find a place for everyone. (Provided by shelter operator)

That’s a huge burden they’re asking those struggling to survive on their own, let alone with children and their partners, to take on.

But no, not every family is good at being co-operative, willing to take on the responsibility of bringing their family together. Some people are just looking for shelter and, when it comes to a lot of shelters, it’s tough to tell who is who and is it safe.

This is what happens when it’s not enough, and that can be enough for people because there’s nobody else to blame but themselves.
