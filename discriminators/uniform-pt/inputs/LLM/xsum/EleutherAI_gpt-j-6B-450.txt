 chancellor, Hamilton told the Labour-Tory Coalition the University of Dundee was an example of how Scottish institutions could thrive outside London, a city he had grown up in. We know we are not going to be the top four in the world in terms of research. But we want to be in the top 20 – we are not in the top 70. We have to be in the top 50. Not all of Scottish universities are in that top 50 but a lot of them are... and for the first time we are looking at what we need to do to be in the top 20. It is no good being in a group and losing by 20 points.

He said it was about moving universities into a new “space in national terms” where their performance was seen to make an “economic and social contribution”. But the current approach of reducing expenditure and introducing cuts in student support - while keeping funding for research at the same level – was not the solution. “This approach has been forced on government because of the demands of the 2010 Spending Review,” he said. “But I think we should have been much more robust in looking at the evidence and how it impacts on universities. This is the wrong approach.”

He listed the following as three key elements in an approach to university funding that could work: a fair, transparent and evidence-based spending review process; making it easier for universities to compete for funding; and the need to address the underlying causes of university performance including in the research element.

He said the Scottish Government’s spending review – which is under way and expected to be published in the autumn - will need to take into account the “realities of universities in a context where higher education funding has been flat-lined for the last five years”.

In a bid to improve research funding and make it more sustainable, the government would make it possible
