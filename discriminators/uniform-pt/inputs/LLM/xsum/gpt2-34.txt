 has reported seeing more than 2,000 terrorists, most of them from Afghan origin, reported to be in the north.

"In a desperate attempt to stop the militants from infiltrating our cities, we decided to evacuate, but now we've come across a group of 10 to 20 militants we know to be from ISIS," said Naghmuddin Qasim, a retired colonel who was head of the US Defence Forces (US) in Kabul and an adviser on defense reforms to the American president, Barack Obama.

US authorities reported some 500 people fleeing what authorities described as a serious incident, including many from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, during a major fighting in northern Afghanistan, he said last week.


Another insurgent, Abu Musab al-Masri, said the militants were not targeting the government buildings in Zaghmiya, the main main government centre in the capital, but they were using an explosive device found in a tunnel under the compound where the militants had barricaded themselves.

Some of these insurgents have entered the district capital without training and have already left the police lines, according to official sources at the time of writing.

Masri said: "I have heard from a police commander in Zaghmiya that they have lost their weapons, and will be going to the other districts this week and the next week. The police have been carrying out what will be their nightly operations."

In August, an insurgent reported being captured near Mazar-i-Sharif in central Kabul, though he was not identified.

The Afghan interior ministry had warned that militants who entered Zaghmiya did not have enough ammunition or ammunition trucks.

In the meantime, US and NATO forces have been pushing insurgent groups from northern Afghanistan into south and northwest regions. They continue to try to stop the growth of extremist groups.

But the Taliban and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) have largely consolidated in south-eastern Afghanistan, with around 60 in the main districts.
