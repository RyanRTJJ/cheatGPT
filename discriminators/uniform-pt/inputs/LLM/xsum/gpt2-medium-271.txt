 have to wait and find out how he is in the coming days," said team-mate Rob Harley.

Afterwards Harvey insisted the injury had nothing to do with his knee troubles.

"It only looked that way when it happened in Italy, I came in with the injury on June 10th. But it had nothing to do with the knee I've had for several months now," he said.

"There's been plenty of times where I've been getting thrown about and I've always had some problems, but nothing this bad.

"At the minute it's all down to my fitness levels and I'll spend a lot of time through the whole squad and just see how it is."

The 26-year-old joined Northampton from Plymouth in January 2014 on a three-and-one-year deals, but has yet to make his senior bow of 16 league appearances since arriving from Wolves in June 2016.

Harvey is desperate to recapture form in an injury-wracked campaign but he admitted his latest knee problem could see him make up time if his body is struggling mentally.

"After getting stuck one time or two times before, obviously I could think, 'I'll take it again,'" said Harvey.

"Now it's a bit of a pain in the tail and I'm sure my body will cope. If it's not on day‑to‑day basis then there's a good chance I'll play again, but for this period I'm just looking forward to spending each one of the away games playing with it and seeing how my fitness progresses.

"That's the most important thing I could be doing and that's what I'm going to focus on, trying to get my fitness up and get back to where I came here and feel like I can get involved in the team."
