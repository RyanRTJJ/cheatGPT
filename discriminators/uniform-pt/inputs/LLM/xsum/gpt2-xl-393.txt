 Police's Operation Cop Cat involved the recruitment of a dedicated group of five police officers to patrol the streets and catch thieves on bikes (see the video below). The officers had specially designed bright orange jackets that featured a distinctive black & yellow pinstriped patch and a bike theft squad at their disposal. They were asked to wear this colour for up to 12 hours a day and were equipped with special bikes and helmets that caught sight of them on crime scenes.

A spokesperson for the University of East London said:

"As a result of this project, the university was not approached by the Met Police to discuss our findings. However, they did respond with a number of questions and I thank them for their willingness to be involved."

Upsi, by the University of East London, runs an initiative aimed at providing education and insight to the police and also promotes research and professionalisation: Copcat is an opportunity to learn lessons that work and don't work and to provide opportunities for young and professional officers.

Upsi has had the police to use as their case study to learn from what works and doesn't work. More than 30 officers took part in that first trial and in the Copcat trial, police from all over London were recruited to wear the bright orange jackets for six months. The UUP MP for South London Steve Double spoke at a Copcat event in July, where the police used the videos that they had filmed on bike crimes to give the case for why CopCat was needed.

The UUP Police and Crime Commissioner for Mid and East Antrim, Jim Wells, said, "Copcat shows us that police on bikes are extremely valuable assets that can save lives and prevent serious crime. The police on bikes work far on this side of the Atlantic and their presence in our capital city is a welcome addition to crime-fighting and the prevention of serious harm and crime.
