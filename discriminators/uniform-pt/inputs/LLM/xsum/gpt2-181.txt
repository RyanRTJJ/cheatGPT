 Time Warner, but it has not yet been resolved, his lawyer said.

The lawsuit against Gawker and related parties follows the publication in the New York Times of a 2012 investigation which described Mr Hogan's alleged predatory behaviour toward teenagers, including at several girls.

A year and a half later in 2011, Mr Hogan and his partner had sex with a 17-year-old at their Miami home. They were arrested and charged with unlawful reporting of child pornography.

A year later they pleaded guilty and were ordered not to disclose video or pictures of the affair to anyone.

Gawker, a network owned by Mr Hogan, filed a class action lawsuit against Time Warner on October 23, 2013 in federal court in Atlantic County, New Jersey, claiming a breach of privacy that triggered a police report that allegedly showed the teenager groping him.

"With a view to making amends, the court has determined that, at all costs, Gawker has failed to meet its obligations to report sexual violence to the appropriate authorities and with good cause."

Gawker did not comment for this article, which you can read here.

In that case, the judge said Gawker "violated every federal or state law â€¦ which requires it to be held liable by a court for any claims of unlawful reporting or against, or against, a police officer".

Earlier this year, Mr Hogan told a news conference he was considering the case.

"For months, I've been talking about how I'm in the process of doing something," he told the Guardian. "It's over. I just can't afford to be quiet. I've got to go in and go get work on the ground.

"This is one of those things where maybe they should take it a step further and make a lawsuit that's a bit more formal, but I'm going to keep this on a case-by-case basis."
