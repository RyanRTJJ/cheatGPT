 been assured she had been entitled to a party invite because she had not been "bought" in a previous party.

An aide claimed to have been sent by the council claiming to be from "the Blackfriars Group, London".

An anonymous source of the Facebook group said: "We are currently experiencing some 'frustration' after we found out that 4,000 people had been named as 'dads' for our birthday."

Another user, commenting on the Facebook post, said: "Why do people keep adding names to datelists, I'd love to see if there's a real social network this would be helpful? I mean it does help some, but just keep them on top of things and see if the lists are up to snuff."

The councillor for the West Midlands council, who last month signed off on the email, said the councillor "couldn't resist" writing a letter to people who had requested information, adding: "We are looking into any names with inappropriate contact details being added to our social networking."

A party invite for the family – called "My Girl on Wheels" – has been posted to the Blackfriars Group, a 'gift giving website' and a social networking page.

The group, organised by the gay, trans and bisexual community, is used in many areas of London, including the North West, where the government hopes to improve social housing, reduce crime and raise revenues.

"A huge part of our success is because as some young people go to bed early, it often causes them to become alienated from their loved ones – from other friends, family and other relationships, as well as their relationships.

"One example I have heard that shows this is going on is a date when the whole group is sleeping early in a room
