 Hajju with a number of journalists in tow from outside who were working in the area. They noticed an injured woman who was crying when she was brought away by the helicopter crew. The women appeared to be well off their normal incomes and they asked everyone to cover Hajj so that they could have a chance to watch Hajj. As they went through the gate, they started shooting at the air force helicopters which shot toward them from various directions. In one case in particular I saw what appeared to be a man in shorts and a coat being handcuffed. The military helicopters said they needed to move this away so they could escape their positions, when they fired the first shots in the man's face. This man was in a bad light for being a man in shorts. An air force helicopter immediately fired back at the helicopter and I remember seeing a man in a long bra and a dark cloak. I was able to see two large military helicopters drop their guns and fire at him. The air force then started shooting in a number of different directions, one hit one helicopter, with both of its missiles firing. After shooting several rounds into the air force helicopters and another one and maybe one missile, this one hit one of the government helicopters that were carrying the victims. So that was a very bad situation.
