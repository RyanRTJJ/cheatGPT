 rob him.

A mother-of-three stabbed to death in a vicious fight has been identified by police.

Ikram Ullah Khan, 28, was stabbed in the neck in the Stratford Road area of Sparkbrook on 2 July.

He had been on his way to work in a shop when he was confronted by up to seven men with blades.

Mr Khan, who lived in Leytonstone, north-east London, died at the scene, Thames Valley Police said.

Seven men previously admitted two counts of murder and conspiring to rob the father-of-three.

A woman, 43, from Romford and a 29-year-old man from Romford remain on police bail until 28 August.

The men are due to appear at Snaresbrook crown court later.

'Very caring man'

Mr Khan's partner and children visited his grave at Stratford Cemetery on Wednesday, with a police officer to escort them to the grave.

He leaves behind three children aged 16, 12 and five.

Police said Mr Khan, originally from Bangladesh, is "well known in local communities and was a very caring and well respected man".

Tributes have been paid to him on a Facebook page set up to remember him, stating that he was "very funny".

A post by his neighbour on the Facebook page - which has been flooded with messages of condolence - says: "I didn't even know he lived in this area. So it is such a shock. Such a great guy.

"He was always asking me in the local area to walk him his dog. Very funny, always cracking the odd joke."
