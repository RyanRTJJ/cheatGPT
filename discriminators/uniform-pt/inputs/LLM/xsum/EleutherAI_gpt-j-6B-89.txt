‘There is a legal argument to be made that the photos are, arguably, in the public sphere,’ said lawyer Euan Dunn, who conducted an online survey of a group of privacy experts, and spoke to several lawyers and academics with interest in the matter.

‘Their being private are not in and of themselves the grounds for a defamation case, but in that case, the public expectation in these circumstances is not that individuals should be allowed to enjoy privacy.’

Mr Dunn added: ‘In terms of freedom of expression, if we accept the argument that these images could be in the public domain, then anyone in the UK or anywhere else is entitled to say that their picture appears on a beach, in a private setting, without their consent.’

Harry had been travelling with Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge when he snapped the picture. The two brothers and their mother were joined at their destination by the Duchess’ mum, Carole Middleton, as well as Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland.

Prince William had previously posted pictures from the beach on social media, but had not revealed himself completely without his wife.

Prince Harry was the first in the royal family to wed a divorced woman. Meghan is the first to marry a black man, although he is also a former member of another royal family.

‘You need to be quite aware of the potential conflict with privacy rights and the right to a private life in Britain,’ Mr Dunn added.

A spokesman from Kensington Palace declined to comment.
