 Davutoglu sweeping powers in a bid to defuse unrest.

Ankara's AK Party-MHP coalition has been shattered by a row over planned elections and a government crisis triggered by the arrest of its then interior minister, who then quit.

Ankara has struggled to keep its power base together since. A number of opposition figures have since been jailed.

Mr Davutoglu now faces the challenge of putting his party together after the sudden resignation of Mr Erdogan's deputy prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu.
