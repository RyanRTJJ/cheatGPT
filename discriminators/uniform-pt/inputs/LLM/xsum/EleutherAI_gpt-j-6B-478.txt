A small minority of troublemakers caused mayhem outside Hampden Stadium. Around 4:20 p.m. local time, three men wearing masks and carrying flares began throwing chunks of concrete and other projectiles at the crowd, injuring six. At the same time, an officer approached a spectator for wearing a T-shirt branded with a song lyrics from the band U2, the Irish rock band. The officer then used a Taser on the spectator. In total, 19 persons were treated for their injuries, four of which were taken to the City Hospital.

Security personnel used pepper spray and batons to control the situation. A group of around 25 young male Scottish nationalists were attacked by British security forces, who used pepper spray and batons to control them. Police later detained several of them while some of them sought to cause more damage. One Scottish Independence Party member in the crowd was attacked by a British security services officer.

At 2:45 p.m., the Scottish National Party held a minute's silence in honor of the victims. The Scottish National Partyâ€™s president, Nicola Sturgeon, issued a statement about the violence, saying, "It was a sickening display of mindless violence perpetrated by some in our society. This was not politics as usual, and the response by our friends and fellow activists was entirely justified."

The Scottish government condemned the attack when it happened.

Police have identified four of the injured as two men and two women. The first woman and the second male victim needed emergency surgery performed successfully, which has stabilized them. The women did not need emergency surgery. One of the injured was a young boy. The boy was taken to a local hospital as a precaution, the statement said.

A person was charged with "causing public disorder and failing to comply with a direction" and remanded in custody.

Another person, a man, was charged with "inciting to cause harassment, alarm or distress by threats, or behavior likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress."

The match between Celtic and Aberdeen began at 5:30 p.m. local time after the players entered the field about three hours before the match began.
