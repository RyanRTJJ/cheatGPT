 23 but it was a quick spell of victory, with Stephen Cook and Arundhati Roy scoring on the final few overs with a hat-trick of six boundaries apiece.The visitors responded with another 100-plus to claim the lead, but Essex quickly found two wickets through James Faulkner before John Compton hit a one-arm duck.

The visitors kept going, however, and Stephen Cook struck again with five runs in to seal the win, while the first over of the day by Jason Holder was made much easier by a six-wicket win for the hosts, ending a dismal run of eight matches.

As usual, Essex won three wickets in this game which gave them all points although this was arguably worse than their first-innings performance for them - with David Lacey taking one wicket and Mark Bravo not able to do anything.

It took them just 11 balls while Australia went around the second pair while South Africa made just five - but with five runs in, the visitors looked like they could take the lead in the 19th over, when Andrew Symonds hit a short ball into off stump to take the series opener.

South Africa won the toss again and England were handed three over for 47, but despite making the most of their opportunity, Essex never really managed to get the job done. They were still leading by three wickets at one point of the day, but it was just five runs after the fourth over when Jay van Loon doubled Sussex out for 10.


That's how Essex started the evening. They
