 have been hit with job losses across the country as the "net effect from Brexit has been to cause widespread job losses".

The Leave campaign will make clear what they mean by that in the run-up to the vote. In a statement on Friday, the Leave campaign said: "For over a year this government, under Tory leadership, have repeatedly pledged to scrap the EU's single market, and we've done so.

"If they win, this result will be the end of free movement of goods, money and people across the continent. Free movement of people could mean you can come to this country from a different country; you could go to a different country on a passport, your employer doesn't have to honour it; you can pay no tax on your income over and above what is owed under national insurance; and you can take whatever money you earn offshore."

Leaving the EU after a two-year transition period is not an option for workers in Northern Ireland and Scotland because of restrictions in the EU budget under which these countries pay into the EU budget.

At its campaign launch in Bournemouth last week, the Leave side stressed that the new prime minister Theresa May's Conservatives were "the only party bringing forward a credible plan for Brexit – one that gets Britain back to work and will save jobs, not just billions".

"In this referendum and during the next government we will have a real choice between Britain as it is today and the kind of membership we were promised three years ago," said the Leave leader, Nigel Farage. "Theresa May and George Osborne are preparing the ground for an extreme hard Brexit – leaving our great country divided, our economy wrecked and our communities and culture torn apart."

The prime minister's team did not respond to an inquiry from the Guardian seeking a response to the leave case for the EU budget.

The Vote Leave strategy for Britain in a post-Brexit world said an exit would lead to "big changes and instability" that would include "huge trade and investment losses, including the consequences for the living standards of European workers and the economy, huge uncertainty, reduced productivity, falling living standards and public spending
