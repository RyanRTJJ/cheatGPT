 with minors. It's impossible to get a tattoo without proof of age, but the undercover reporter was able to get fake ID. The story is also the first to report what the tattoo artists told their customers about their age: "I'm 16" and "11" were the most common responses.





A Florida teen is dead after allegedly taking part in the "worst tattoo" contest in the state.

Lori Lynn Green was taken into custody at a Florida tattoo shop shortly after she took part in the contest, according to News 6. The contest promised to give free tattoos and prizes to its participants and those of the previous three years.

Green had reportedly told her relatives that she was underage, saying she was a 16-year-old high-school senior. However, when investigators looked at pictures of Green from past contests, they found she appeared to be 20 years old. She was reportedly paid $100 to do a tattoo on her arm, but prosecutors said she may not have even been in high school at the time.

Groups urge federal oversight of tattoo parlors

The tattoo parlor was not cited for the illegal tattooing of a minor. Green is now charged with "procurement of minors and youths for prostitution, solicitation of minors, sexual conduct by a disabled person, promoting prostitution, and prostitution within 1,000 feet of a church or school," according to WTSP.

A lawsuit claims the girl was sold into a sex trafficking ring by two men who picked her up at a party.

"If it wasn't for a tattooed girl at a party that I was at it would have been easier to pass myself off as old enough," the girl's mother reportedly told a judge.

"The idea that a child is a disposable commodity, or that anyone can buy or sell a child like they can a car or a mattress is revolting."

In response, the American Academy of Pediatrics said it would support federal oversight of tattoo parlors.

"The safety of underage tattooing appears to be a nationwide issue, and there seems to be a very low level of oversight for parlors that tattoo minors," said
