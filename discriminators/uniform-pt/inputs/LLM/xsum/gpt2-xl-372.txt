 the tragic deaths are at the heart of ongoing issues surrounding the state's domestic violence laws, and the role of the judiciary.

The state's domestic violence law was changed late last year in response to the killing of an 18-year-old woman at the hands of her partner last year. A new law came into effect in October this year, but some commentators question if it is working.

Forced separation was once commonplace, but the rate of divorce within the past decade has plummeted. Lockyer said the laws were so weak that victims "can't get away fast enough."

"We're having to accept that the courts just aren't working as we'd hope, they aren't working, they aren't working well enough and we have to be honest in this country that there is a widespread breakdown in the judiciary system," he told the ABC.

Lockyer told the ABC, "we're getting so many more victims of these murders that now we should start looking at changes to the laws.

"This is our responsibility. We get to pick the judges. we can get someone with good character to sit in front of us; we can't get someone with bad character in front of us."

The former president of Western Australia's Australian Institute for Family Studies, Dr Margaret Cunneen says mandatory marriage counselling should be introduced in every state and territory.

But to increase public understanding about domestic violence, laws should change not only to protect women, but men as well.

Cunneen told the ABC, 'We need a way of measuring the numbers of males, females, children, people in their late 20s and early 30s who are in that kind of relationship or who are at risk (of being in that kind of relationship), and all our evidence shows that these kinds of relationships are the ones where most of the abuse occurs.

"Our law does not look at that kind of relationship."

Last year I spoke to social worker, Rosie Battista, on Q&A about the lack of education for judges. She said there were three main issues. One, lack of information is the second problem. Judges will argue for a reduction in sentences
