On top of the heavy water came another disaster: more than 50 tons of radioactive material.

The radioactive material was stored at a nuclear testing lab near Fortaleza in northern, central and south-eastern Brazil, officials said.

But officials in Brazil's top nuclear regulator refused to give the location of the site of the nuclear testing station and its location, or the date of the accident, saying that information is not available to them until the result is known for sure.

Authorities believe those killed died at the site, which stands two miles from the site of the accident on July 7. The accident is still under investigation and officials say they could not give any timetable.

However, the plant shut down immediately because of a severe lack of power and a severe accident.

Brazil's environment minister, Fernando Marques, told reporters on Wednesday that the accident has already damaged public finances and the government was now looking for a solution to deal with the disaster. The government has imposed a $1 billion bond for the cost of cleanup and rehabilitation.

But he did not say how much that cost would be and said investigators would not rule out trying to collect a higher value for the risk of radioactive pollution from the plant.

While Brazilian authorities have not released the location of the nuclear testing site, officials said a preliminary analysis of seismic waves from the accident shows no possibility it could provide a reliable indication of the fate of dead or dying people who died in that area, so they cannot decide to place blame yet.

In addition, officials want to explore alternative options for dealing with the disaster by rebuilding the plant and reducing fuel loads, such as using wind power, which does not need electricity and would, for example, enable it to run 24 hours a day after the spill, rather than just 24 hours a day a
