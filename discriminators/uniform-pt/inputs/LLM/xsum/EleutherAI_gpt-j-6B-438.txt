Business visitors topped the list, with £843m being spent, followed by overseas visitors (totalling £716m), holidaymakers (£569m) and UK citizens (£513m). In terms of sectors, tourism businesses, transport businesses and other services were most likely to have made use of tourism, with nearly £2.5bn spent on travel arrangements. For the whole of Scotland, visitor numbers declined slightly, with 15.7m going there in the 12 months up to March 2015 compared with 15.9m in the year ending March 2013.

There were around 30,000 people working in the Scottish leisure industry at the end of 2014; the ONS says this is a 17% fall in the number working than in 2000.
