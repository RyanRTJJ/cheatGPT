 into the second half helped send the game into extra time, Klopp said: "I don't think so. We got through the extra time."

Klopp was adamant the team will not panic if they do not win their remaining two games.

"When you come out of the FA Cup and the Europa League with the two victories you can always play, but as a group you've got to stay together to go through," the Liverpool boss said.

Pleeton 'could have snatched a late goal, but did too much talking in the second half'

"We've said all the time until now, we'll be in the top four, and we could have won the game in the end, but played very good today, and probably could have had a couple of goals in the final 10-minute of the game and gone through.

"For us the Europa League is very important. We have to use the Europa League to get the best out of our players.

"If you don't, you just play in the Premier League, you'll get another result - the same result. I'm sure we're going to go with a lot of spirit from the game and the fight in the group, but we'll have to win some of these games at home by a good margin to stay in the position we are in."

Mamadou Sakho's late goal secured a much-changed Arsenal in the competition, but Klopp said: "For every game individually, I'm not a big believer of the results. For the group, to stay together and fight like today is always the way we'll win."

"We won't talk about the game for some reason. He probably won't see
