 that would make the line faster.

This is a government that has said it values the railways, but they have not said how they value it.

The group is a campaign group formed by a group of Lincolnshire businesses and citizens. They want the government to look at the cost of upgrading the railway line. These improvements would be made at various levels, including the electrification.

The campaign group is very concerned about the length of time journeys are taking and the journey times between Lincoln and Nottingham are now slower than they were 100 years ago. They believe that the government must fund the electrification upgrade work in order to make it quicker.

Jobs for Lincolnshire is a group campaigning for local growth and they claim the current figures are ‘shocking’. Their concern is that the government is spending billions of pounds on the Brexit negotiations when the investment could boost local economies in Lincolnshire rather than outside the county.

The Campaign for Better Transportation in the East Midlands has also backed the call for the electrification and claims that the government must invest in upgrading the track and train and invest in the infrastructure and the signalling.

The National Train Operating Company, Network Rail and Stagecoach share responsibilities over train services.

Their aim is to minimise travel time and costs of journeys which are often the most expensive. This happens because people are travelling in and between major cities and it is expensive to do so.

Network Rail is responsible for the major improvements. The other bodies have responsibility for smaller upgrades.

The railway is the third busiest railway in the UK just behind London and Manchester. It carries more traffic than the M40 each day. The line is used to carry freight between London and England and Wales as well as passengers.

The campaign group has launched a petition, and many people are signing it in support of them. It calls for the government to fund the electrification of the line and say more information needs to be given on the benefits.

The group feel that they are being forgotten about and the government do not value the railways.
