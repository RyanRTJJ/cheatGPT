 the grounds that Mr Attfield was a "vicious murderer". A trial date has been set for 7 November.

The two teenagers, both from Wycombe, west Sussex, were stabbed 14 times. The prosecutor told the court the boy's version of what happened was "a lie" and that he had concocted "a story about some other man having done this to him".

Criminal defence lawyer Jonathan Shattock said the boy had been angry at having been made to miss out on a £500 (US$700) GCSE trophy for his GCSEs – an award that has not been paid out since 2004 – and that he and his mother had been driven into poverty and homelessness by his father, whose employment in construction had come to an end.

Mr Attfield's mother, who is now living with the boy, had been "furious" that her son was being offered a job with a private hire firm as a "librarian", rather than taking a lower-paid job with the family's local NHS trust, Shattock told the jury.

Mr Attfield was "the one who stabbed your son, not him," he was told, and "had nothing to do with it".

He claimed he had been drinking and had been jealous his mother was spending more time with
