 the jet might be allowed to fly.

"The FAA remains confident this aircraft meets the stringent requirements of the FAA's airworthiness directive and certification requirements, including Boeing's requirement that it carry out a thorough review of the design and the system function to ensure that there are no undiagnosed or un-addressed weaknesses that present a danger to flying," the agency said in a statement.

Boeing said in a separate statement that its design review "is moving forward, on schedule". "We are addressing all of the concerns raised. We will continue to focus on safety and have no further comment on this order," it said.

Airbus' approval will allow the world's two leading jetmakers and most-booked plane manufacturers to compete on a wide range of models.

The deal comes after years of rivalry between the pair that ended in a major compromise. In August 2014, the US and the EU agreed that they would no longer take steps that would hobble industry rival Airbus' ability to compete.

"As was set out by the US and European Commission during the negotiations, finalising the ATR aircraft has created a level playing field for all manufacturers that can now benefit from a strong global jet industry," said John Leahy, acting US representative on the EU's anti-trust committee.

After years of wrangling, Airbus and Boeing agreed on March 31 to narrow the price gap, a move analysts described as critical to restoring competitiveness in a fast-growing segment of the market.

French President Emmanuel Macron called it a "historic day for both our industrial champions and for Europe".

"Airbus is a key French industrial asset, and we are looking forward to sharing its expertise in our aeronautics sector," he said in a statement.

As part of the agreement, Airbus said it had given the European Commission up to eight months to review its offer and to impose restrictions on any of its products that, for example, would affect the price on which Boeing could sell parts
