 to the image. Now the image will be in public domain in the US.

As you read on you'll find all the details in the legal file, but in brief an American jurist has ruled that I believe the photograph can be released after a US court ruled I did not invent the image. I have now applied to the US Copyright Office for a renewal of my licence to use the image, so that this can now be published on the web. I will get the copyright statement signed by the owner of the copyright in the US, which will give me full rights to reproduce it.

The original image is now in the public domain in the USA. It will remain there in the USA until it expires on the 1st January 2015. As far as I know this is the first time that a single photograph has been in the public domain in America. That means that people anywhere in the world, including the USA, can use a photograph they see in the book without the photographer's permission.

David Slater has already contacted me and is planning to publish the book. I am disappointed that he chose not to do so. I have been a photographer for 34 years and was one of the first on an Indonesian island to have a camera in the jungle. I have a personal interest in the rights to the image (I am also a photographer), so that was an important consideration. Unfortunately, I was not able to convince him that it was in the public domain, he did not believe that was correct. I have spent 18 months researching and drafting the book, using a book publisher I have worked with. I am really pleased with the publication that will be coming out in April. If my new book will benefit David Slater in any way, I am delighted about that. I'm sure he will enjoy the publicity.

I've been asked if there are plans to publish
