rower James Milner took a wicket against the Australians and an additional two for batting.

But the decision to suspend him for the first Test of this year means there is no place for a Test match this summer to play during the new, new regime.

A move to the other Test venue will be delayed at least a week for the players involved.

The decision also suggests it is time for the international team for the final four Test series to give its final report.

"This issue is about making sure that the player or organisation who has not been subject to suspension under this new regime has the opportunity to continue their football with the full support of the international teams," a World T20 Cricket Board of Australia statement said.

"This time around, one of the three senior team members will be on the sidelines during this important meeting."

Nathaniel Husaini, one of three of the five named to the squad with a number of wickets, was named captain, with his second one being awarded and his third being also awarded.

The final two Tests of 2018 in South Africa and Sri Lanka are also set for the summer of 2018.
