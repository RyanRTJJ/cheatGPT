 planned to move a second missile attack onto surface-to-air weapons sites in Syria.

The Russian navy claimed the flight was accidental as the aircraft was flying at an altitude of between 300 and 500 metres (0.2 and 1,000 ft) above ground during an emergency manoeuvre. But other reports said the plane was flying at close to 500 metres and the problem was with the heat shield and not the engines. A source told RIA Novosti that a search would be made for the Admiral Kuznetsov. If the plane is found under water then it would be used to test another new type of heat shield meant to protect high-flying planes.

Russia has denied any role in the shooting down of the plane but did not reject the US statement that it could have been targeting the Syrian airbase being used to launch air strikes from over the Mediterranean Sea.

"We've received an official statement from the US that they don't really know how it happened," a military expert said. It was later revealed that President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov had said the Russian fleet had conducted joint exercises with its Nato ally earlier in the week.

US officials also denied they were targeting Syrian government air defences but added in a lengthy statement: "We will take action if those involved in the shooting down of MH17 continue to target civilian airports."

They added: "The United States remains engaged in a global campaign to deny violent extremism access to the skies."

The Russian envoy to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has said the fleet's involvement in the shoot-down is an accidental and legal accident. However, it is unlikely any of the vessels would ever be used for such an operation and the fleet's commander was at the time, and has since been, responsible for Russian military engagement. "They are all safe and in proper hands and working conditions," said Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor
