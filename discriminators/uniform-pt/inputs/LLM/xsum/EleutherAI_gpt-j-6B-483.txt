 conditions regulations, if they consider the activity as temporary rather than permanent.

Last week's decision has shocked some who think this is a case of a major mistake by the EAT.

Beverley Taylor, of Irwin Mitchell, says the decision could be extremely costly to firms in the building industry which were not previously aware.

"Any employer, whether they are building firms or those carrying out building services or gas installers or sales representatives, they have to ensure that they have all the necessary workers covered by sickness, maternity pay, hours of work and all those other things. Those are key elements of the Working Time Regulations," she says.

"We have a real concern where those employers could be facing a very large bill, for them to be in need of providing those additional employment and working conditions, within the same building or the same company, which would cost them some large sums of money.

"A number of businesses will already be very busy in dealing with this case, and there will be a
