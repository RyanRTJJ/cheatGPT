 not be given full standing in a UN report and denied giving the order in any way.

"We need to be honest about what happened and we need to do a lot of more research," Dayan said.

He also said he would ask for more time to study with the world's best experts.

Israel won 24 international competitions at home, including the 1998 IAAF World Championship in London, that had been contested in Israel over eight consecutive weeks, including a three-week international qualifying tournament and the 2012 Olympic Trials in Dubai. It was also in the running for the 2013 Olympics to take place in Sochi, which is also held at the Jordan-Syria border, and was also awarded a second gold medal.

Israel had already lost all of its international rankings since 2006, and the Israeli media had long criticized what it called anti-Semitism.

Named "The New Jim Crow" by the New York Times, Dayan, who is also Israeli citizens and was awarded a medal in the U.S. under a program called the New Black Panther movement, played a key role in building Palestinian human rights after he won the 1993 Nobel Peace prize.

He has also led a peaceful demonstration in 2011 that led Israeli authorities to release 14 Palestinians charged with insulting the Muslim faith and using anti-Semitic slogans.

Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has called the Israeli government's decision "very shocking," saying the Arab world is the main target of the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

"We need to make sure that the Palestinians are not just killed but forced to live on a place of slavery," he said.

He took the opportunity to thank Israelis for "providing support" to protesters in the Gaza Strip and praised "every member of the international community, especially from the United States of America" who he called "one of the most committed, creative and committed people who ever stood up for the fundamental human rights of the Palestinian people."
