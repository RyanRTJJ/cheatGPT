 timing of Monday's debate on Theresa May's decision to introduce legislation "clamping down" on the UK's EU exit negotiations.

The Daily Telegraph reported on its website earlier in the day that Mr Corbyn's team had received a draft of the speech on Thursday. As part of the debate preparation, he was supposed to address the Guardian and The Observer ahead of the day's announcement of the winner. "Mr Corbyn's office are waiting for a comment or briefing on the Guardian's article on BBC TV's flagship news show The Politics Man before their response," the newspaper tweeted.

The newspaper would not say whether it had seen the speech.

Mr Corbyn's office later issued a statement claiming it was untrue to suggest he was planning a bid for leader. "The Labour leader believes passionately in the values of the Labour movement and being actively engaged with the Party he leads. He does not underestimate or underestimate the difficulty in getting the party he leads to elect him leader of the Labour Party.

"Any suggestion that the Labour leader is making a bid for leadership must be treated with utter contempt. This is not true and should be challenged immediately."

Speaking to Sky News the night before, Mr Corbyn dismissed the plan. "Jeremy will be speaking to people as part of his preparations for these debates but I don't see that they're going to give me a job," he said.
