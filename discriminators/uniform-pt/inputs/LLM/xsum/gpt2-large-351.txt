 clear that the problem of car crime is just as real and pervasive in Manchester as anywhere else. Every day across the city there are at least 10 reported assaults, thefts and burglaries."

Detective Inspector David Moore, from Greater Manchester Police, said: "People need to learn from what happened to Mike - and use the experience in their own communities."


Detective Inspector Moore said the force had seen a major spike in reported crimes, and the trend continued. Figures show that offences in Greater Manchester have increased by 33% over the financial year to April last year.


The statistics also show that motor vehicle theft in Greater Manchester more than doubled in the last year to July last year.


The Metropolitan Police's head of violent crime Chris Yates, said: "[The] rise in car crime is concerning. Motor vehicle crime represents one in every three crimes dealt with by police."

A spokeswoman for West Cheshire Police said a team of officers were dedicated to increasing road safety. They would continue to focus on increasing awareness of road safety in areas already suffering a high level of road traffic incidents.


Natalie Wilson, the campaign manager with the Road Haulage Association, said: "The increase in car crime suggests that the number of people using dangerous and illegal methods to steal cars is increasing exponentially."

But the force stressed safety concerns remained a key factor in its campaigns, as well as its drive to improve road infrastructure, and said, "We know that a car on the road remains a secure and safe space but the risk of that vehicle being stolen is real. We will increase the visibility of police to increase the chances of an owner recognising their car."

The force will also publish a "Road Safety Action Plan" designed to tackle safety concerns and tackle criminals' growing interest.

A force spokesman said: "We make no apology for being responsible for road safety in our region."
