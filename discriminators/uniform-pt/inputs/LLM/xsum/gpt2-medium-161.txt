Slimer, who has also created a variety of models of animals as well as human figures, has been calling for months for a human statue of an ape, and she has already received a lot of response to her latest design - though it seems few will agree that such a figure is an aesthetic failure. He believes that his creation is more than just a mere piece of visual art, noting that the human figure is in itself still an integral part of his project.

"When we have a human standing for the first time with our first eyes open is when we have touched the heart of humanity," explains Slimer. "I see a reflection of how all these worlds interact in our everyday lives."

Indeed, Slimer himself feels the figure is just the first step in establishing contact with humanity that is necessary for a just and peaceful generation of global society.

While the idea of creating an "infinite" statue of ape-man is already widespread, there is still much disagreement at best about what makes the statue in question. As noted above, there is considerable debate over whether the figure is accurate in representing the general notion of a human being, or is just another representation of what the human body is known for.

This is where artists on the other side can help, particularly artists in the field of 3D modelling, which may offer much-needed help to those challenging the current standard of portrayal of humans as both cartoonish and ugly.
