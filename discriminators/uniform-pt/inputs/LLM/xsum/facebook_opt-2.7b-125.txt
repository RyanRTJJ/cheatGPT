 Nations

Scotland have won their ninth successive autumn international and now top a Six Nations rugby table for the first time in four years.

Fittingly it was an all-conquering performance from captain Greig Laidlaw, who scored two of the tries.

The hosts, led by another impressive display from Greig Laidlaw, beat France 33-13 in Paris.

France gave themselves a chance with an impressive first-half performance, but Scotland controlled the second period to win convincingly.

Laidlaw, who helped Ireland to two Grand Slams, was involved in almost every try-scoring move, having scored the bonus-point second-half try that put the match beyond France, who have now lost their last seven in a row against Scotland.

Scotland were already in contention at half-time - winning 13-5 at the Stade de France - and went in front early on when Laidlaw put Jamie Ritchie over the line after a scrum-half pass from Finn Russell had put the winger on the attack.

The second-half scores came courtesy of tries to Blair Kinghorn, who won his first cap, Huw Jones and Laidlaw himself.

The result brings Scotland within four points of Ireland's tally for this season and puts them top of both Europe and the global standings. Scotland also beat Ireland and, alongside Wales and England, are the only teams to have won each of their last four Tests in the same format.

For the Scots that puts them in prime position to beat any opponent in the Six Nations which starts on 3 February.
