-year-old woman were taken to hospital but have since been released.

“It is an unfortunate incident,” an Eastern Ambulance Service (EAS) spokesman said, adding initial estimates suggested the two affected people had been badly burned when they fell from the apartment’s balcony onto an oil drum full of flammable liquid.

The fire was believed to have started after a man in a van took his keys from his apartment and left the building.

A man who lives in the apartment complex told the Evening Standard that he was shocked they could have been left living in such a blaze. He described seeing one of the residents sitting on the balcony smoking a cigarette at around 5am.

“He was the only one here at first and said he took the keys when he left the house, but the people on the balcony saw him taking the keys from his own house,” he said.

“He then came back in an hour or so afterwards, and we had not seen anybody on the balcony at all.

“There was quite a big fire downstairs and the windows upstairs were smashed in, but nobody was seriously hurt. We don’t know what happened to the people upstairs.”

Residents were evacuated from their flat after the fire was extinguished.

The man said that he saw an elderly man come home after work around 5.30am and saw three people living in the flat.

He then heard someone calling out for help and found the elderly man on the balcony, crying, because his apartment had been destroyed by the flames.

“He had very bad burns on his chest and stomach and had nothing on. He was very lucky to be alive,” he said.

The EAS spokesman continued: “We have sent our crews to the site in order to investigate the incident and have taken the number of victims to four. Our thoughts at this stage are of the two residents we took to hospital. The man and woman both sustained very serious burns and have been moved to a specialist burns unit.”
