 in all competitions, drawing six and losing five.

His side have the worst defence in England, conceding 51 goals in 23 games this season, and Neville said his side must not be afraid to play differently if the situation demands it.

"I think, as a group, we are trying too hard," Neville said. "We are trying to impress the fans. Sometimes you have to have a little bit of a kick to the backside and say, 'Right lads, here we go, let's do this different,' and play with a purpose that maybe we haven't played with."

"Sometimes you have to take risks, I accept that, but sometimes you need to accept that you're not going to get the win. We've got to go in tonight and be more positive and enjoy ourselves."

With only two Premier League games left - at champions Manchester United on April 13 and against Chelsea at Old Trafford on April 27 - the team face a race against time to get into the top four.

Victories over bottom-placed Aston Villa, who host fourth-placed Manchester City on Saturday, would leave them just two points behind Chelsea with just nine games to go.

"I've said to the players, it's now or never now I think, to try and close that gap," Neville said.

"We have to understand the implications of what we're coming up against, the pressure that's on and the challenge that sits before us. It's going to be a tough evening for us." (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Justin Palmer)
