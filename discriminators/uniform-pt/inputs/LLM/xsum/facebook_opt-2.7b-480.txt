 hit by a series of safety scandals in recent years.

He said he had made no decisions yet on whether to apply higher tariffs on the world's largest beef producer, given that imports of Brazilian beef already come subject to hefty tariffs of more than 25 per cent.

"That [further tariff] would be very difficult for Brazil to swallow," Mr Temer told reporters after a speech at the American Chamber of Commerce.

"Brazil is going through a serious economic crisis, [it has] a national debt of 60 per cent of GDP, and this makes it more difficult."

Trade row

Brazil's beef exports are valued at nearly R$80 billion (Â£18.4 billion, or $38 billion) in the year leading up to April 2018, according to official statistics.

In January, the European Union imposed duties on Brazilian beef, citing the country's high sanitary standards as a reason for the action. The US imposed new tariffs on Brazilian beef in March, also citing sanitary concerns.

Brazilian exports have fallen by 14 per cent this year, while exports from the US have jumped 17 and 23 per cent.

The US is Brazil's sixth-largest market by trade, importing more than US$2 billion of goods each year, Reuters reported in April.

Mr Temer denied he had agreed any kind of deal to end the trade row with the US.

"We're not talking about a contract. That's not reality," he said. "I know that the Americans don't want this kind of negotiation. There's a big trade war in the United States right now.

"I think they're more interested in a negotiated agreement."

Relations with China, however, have been better, Mr Temer added.

"We've had very constructive discussion with the Chinese, and I'm confident at the end, we will be a winner," he said without elaborating.
