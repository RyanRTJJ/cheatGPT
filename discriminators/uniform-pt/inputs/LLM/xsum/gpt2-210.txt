 the court found that his condition was "extremely" serious when found because he was unable to eat the rice and had diabetes that threatened to cause kidney failure. He was rushed to a hospital to be treated, but he failed the check for a bowel movement.

The boy's parents, Shulam and Khari, had pleaded guilty to manslaughter on Monday, saying he was the cause of their daughter's death.

The family's lawyers said the sentence would enable them to file a formal appeal with the supreme court that would bring him to a better, more productive life. They said there had been no evidence of any health complications for his mother, his father's wife and their three children. They said that the court had taken "significant steps to avoid the death of a child with diabetes."

In a statement, senior civil servant Aileen Mokdad and public health minister Chiran Raghavan said: "The fact that children with diabetes were sent to hospital despite proper evidence demonstrates that health care and care professionals have failed to consider this case. We will contest the decision to impose a severe sentence. "This is a significant miscarriage of justice for our daughter's life. Her care and support, which they provided to their daughter, has been taken for granted and she will suffer further physical, psychological and spiritual scars as a result of his diabetes failure in his parents' eyes."

After winning his appeal, Imran's mother, Aisha, said her son would now live "full life of dignity and comfort" despite the sentence. She added this would give her son "a safe, productive life and a safe place in society". Her son was due to travel to the United States for treatment, but family sources told Reuters the doctors, who are not authorised by the government, refused.

The ruling was the first time an adult and two sons have been convicted of manslaughter. No
