 of the Committee: “I do not think there are that many people in Britain that would say they would not be regarded, in respect of matters of law and of the way in which they will go about their lives, as British. And therefore, the idea that you can put this in an article of the constitution, that you need that, is not very good… I would say the only thing that will be British is your constitution, I cannot think of anything else that could define what it is.”

He continued: “I cannot think of anything else that would be British because British means that you’ve got this law that I would follow, I obey it, you’ve got this history that I will obey… you’ve got this food that I will eat, you’ve got this drink that I will drink, and if I’ve got the right passport, I will travel there. That is British. You cannot define what you’re going to be on that basis…”

Mr David Davis, a member of both the Committee and also the Remain side of the Brexit debate, said: “British is a bit of a muddle. I think it is entirely subjective. I would argue that Britishness is entirely subjective in terms of the way that it is formed and the way in which we define it.”

Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve

Mr Grieve told the Committee “bizarre” ideas had been floated by some people on how to define Britishness. He said: “There are various definitions that people have thrown out there, the way in which they claim Britishness… I think the idea that you can put a Britishness that is defined and that there will be no confusion about it is just bizarre.”

But Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: “I think in terms of the legal definition we are actually better off to have nothing in the constitution at all than to have the words ‘Britishness’ in there.”

A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “Sir Kenneth expressed concerns about the idea of defining Britishness. These views are shared by many and the Government does not agree with them.
