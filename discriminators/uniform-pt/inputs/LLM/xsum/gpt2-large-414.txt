 the virus has also been linked to Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Guillain-Barre, and other neurological illness. According to the WHO, the virus has also been linked to microcephaly and other birth defects.

The WHO said it is unlikely that people with Zika will be able to spread the virus to any other countries. However, some regions could do so "without any noticeable effect on the global population as far as we know" the agency said, adding "we have so far done very little to analyse potential risks" of a global spread.

The WHO's executive director, Margaret Chan, also warned that "over-the-counter mosquito repellents that are not approved for human use are a source of concern".

"Over-the-counter preparations contain hundreds of ingredients. Use can cause serious side effects due to their wide use. We're not convinced that there is a good public health rationale for products with fewer ingredients," she said, noting that those included in these products are more unlikely to pose health risks.

The WHO said it had started investigating the use of an over-the-counter drug that contained the mosquito repellent nifedipine, which is also contained in some insect repellents, after noticing a rise in cases of Zika infections.

"Over-the-counter products are not approved for human use and there are concerns about potential risks to the public health. We have made the precautionary approach with products containing nifedipine," Chan said.

The WHO says that in many cases of Zika, the virus can be transmitted to humans by mosquito bites, but in some parts of the world the mosquito that is bitten may not show symptoms. "We don't yet know if Zika is transmitted by mosquitoes that do not show symptoms," Chan said.

Chan said a team of experts had already published a report on a report, "WHO response to the Zika outbreak: the need for coordination, strategy and management to limit the spread of the virus to countries and regions most at risk".
