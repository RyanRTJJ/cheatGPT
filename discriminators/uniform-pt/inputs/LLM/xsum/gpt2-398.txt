The city council expects about 100 new jobs at the site and expects to invest £300,000 to £500,000 in an expansion at nearby St Kilda Oval, and £100,000 to £500,000 in other projects.

He said the site, which he called "the world's largest modern building", was used for a number of years as an employment center and said it was still up and running in 2018 or 2019.
