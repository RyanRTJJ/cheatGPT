 Conservative MP.

Brentwood and Basildon councils, with 11.5 and 11.4 per cent, respectively, share the lowest share of the vote with UKIP.

In Southend, Tory candidates hold one seat, with the Labour candidate in the last election winning two.

In Castle Point, where the Tories are not standing a candidate this time, the Conservatives and UKIP share the lowest share of the vote, at 1 per cent.

There is no overall majority here at present, but Basildon, according to Mr Coyle, now has a more balanced council with Labour and the Conservatives both on the same side.

The former minister also said the Tories were in the process of negotiating a deal to try and persuade the Independent Group of MPs not to back UKIP.

In Basildon, for example, there is no longer a UKIP councillor so could not take over their council seat.

But it is the Lib Dems’ candidate who is on a council campaign, which may yet lead to him/her losing her seat.

There is some confusion when it comes to who actually controls Basildon council, with Mr Coyle saying the councils administration is not under the Tory leadership but has been run by a ‘group’ of Lib Dems and Tories.

He said: “The problem that came out of that coalition is they have done a pretty poor job. The Lib Dems are much more able to offer us good quality candidates and some money.”

Mr Coyle said the party has no plans to stand any other candidates other than its four present, with the Lib Dems having had their own candidates in the election and with the Independent Group now not fielding any.

He said that any party which won the election did not have to pay a deposit or any other fees if they won and only had to spend a ‘reasonable amount’ by canvassing and leafleting.

But if a party did not get the 10 per cent vote of at least five per cent of eligible voters then they would not pay the deposit and would have to pay an extra £100 to £200 to stand a candidate.
