It is due to be launched in 2018, but its predecessor, the telescope's launcher, is being built in a shed in the Mojave Desert in California, near the launch pad.

To launch the Webb telescope, NASA's space shuttle Atlantis took off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in February 2011, and the spacecraft was placed on an orbit around the Earth.

However, when it is ready it will have to travel around the sun to reach its position in space.

The telescope will be taken to a highly elliptical orbit that crosses the poles of the Earth, allowing the observatory to capture observations in most parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

One of these parts is infrared, and that's where Webb's successor, the next-generation Hubble Space Telescope, has been taking much of its most recent pictures.

NASA's Deep Space Climate Observatory has also been observing the Earth and sky from deep in space for nearly 30 years, monitoring the change in temperature at and below the surface of the atmosphere as the planet rotates.

But Webb, which the agency hopes will rival Hubble in its abilities, will also be able to study the early Universe and how the first galaxies formed.

"We can make unprecedented images from that region," said Mike Broussard from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

"If NASA were to start a mission to map the entire sky with a telescope, it would be an enormous undertaking.

"But it will take only one Webb mission to cover an important fraction of the sky."

Some of the light the telescope will collect from that region will not pass through the Earth's atmosphere, which reduces the amount of radiation the telescope will have to endure.

"In the future, most of the light collected by Webb in that spot will not need to be shielded from the Sun because of the Earth's atmosphere," said Mr Broussard.

"That is a big step forwards."

He explained that in space, there is less radiation from the Sun than there is in Earth's atmosphere.

And so reducing the amount of shielding the
