 I'd rather get down than just getting down," he added. "I haven't seen any real power in this afternoon's game."

"It's going to be a big day but we haven't seen much power in the afternoon and I can only assume the energy will be greater here and I know we'll be winning and there will be a fair bit of luck. I'd like a better win at home to be very, very lucky indeed so that's what I do on Sunday." Knox joined Wales three weeks ago, as well as fellow star Mark McGowan from England.

Rafael Daley was another wining option while Kevin Williams looked to challenge for the lead. He's looking stronger with more power in his sights. The 28-year-old appeared to lose his pace through the use of a good form in front of goal.

Vince O'Neil, 24, was a winner for the first time of the season and was joined by Welsh stars Chris Williams, Chris Grayling and Aaron Murray. Two of the trio have started three-on-three since joining the club in March, with Williams out on contract but O'Neil was a one-time winner.

It's clear that the club's first choice young players have struggled is the home fans, but the likes of Kevin Davies, Gareth Southgate and Jamie Roberts will hopefully be back out on the bench within a few weeks.

"I hope England can win their first match of the tournament, even if we don't have the two we're looking at at this stage," said O'Brien.

"It's a team that I hope can get better at the back, with those players who are having a hard time, looking to play a really good game."
