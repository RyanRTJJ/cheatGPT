 Naiyaravoro won with a stunning finish to put the Golden Gods in the lead, with Warriors wing Daly Cherry-Evans hitting the side-netting with 1:12 left to send the game to penalties despite the scoreline.

Hooker Matt Prior started the game strong with 26 possessions along with 4 marks and 4 rebounds to set his Warriors back line up before scoring twice in the third quarter to go with 26 possession.

The Warriors had already used a 19minute try-less period to start the second period after Daly Cherry-Evans returned after being sidelined due to a stress reaction in his leg.

Spencer Wigglesworth took the opening penalty over half-time before Josh Schache added a 30-miler penalty at the other end of the field over a minute later.

Hooker Alex Fasolo added a third, before hooker James Maloney added another with 11 minutes remaining to set up an emphatic finish.

The Warriors led 14-10 at half-time.
