 on roads, and even to take liquids to the toilet.

It has been made on the basis of the concept of a "sliming effect", where small particles stick to surfaces while larger particles slide off, creating a "clay" surface.

They added: "The film coating is flexible, not completely flexible but certainly flexible enough to use and easily work on glassware of different shapes and thicknesses.

The researchers are planning to use the coating to make the glass interiors of wine bottles thin and hard. They will then use this same system to make the packaging of food such as coffee and cookies thin and hard."

It was invented by Prof. Erez Avizar at Tel Aviv University. He told MailOnline: "Our research in this area in particular showed that a thin film coating could be used to enhance the grip of hard plastic or ceramic surfaces to provide an efficient way of sealing them with thin water-tight lids.

"We envision that the coating could be applied to the plastic parts of many products to make them less fragile. Our work in this area in particular showed that a thin film coating could be used to enhance the grip of hard plastic or ceramic surfaces to provide an efficient way of sealing them with thin water-tight lids."

He added that they made the coating on a commercial scale for use in the automotive industry.

The results of the study, which were published in a recent edition of Journal of Applied Physics, indicate that the effect is due to tiny particles clinging to the surfaces like sandpaper.

Prof. Aizik's team have now launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter to help them scale up the process – and hopefully get the coating out to the market sooner.

The first round of donors will be asked to choose between a bottle for $60 (£46) or glass on which to insert the
