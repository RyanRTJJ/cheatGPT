 promising that “We don't even have a security guard at our building. Our employees work without any security” and that “the Chinese government has never asked us to build backdoors or install spyware into Huawei products.” “We're willing to work with all other organisations, provided they believe in a safe, trustworthy and secure mobile experience.

The company will now attempt to continue expanding its efforts by investing in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics and the Internet of Things. It's first steps into those areas will be launching in China, while its global expansion will be focused on markets that recognise the value of innovation. The company has plans to roll out 5G mobile services by the end of 2019. 5G is seen as a faster and more affordable means of connection for all devices, such as smartphones, cars and the Internet of Things. But, Huawei faces challenges to its expansion, as the US continues to block its access to the technology. It faces a separate issue that has emerged in recent times. Law enforcement agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation are increasingly concerned about the risks associated with 5G technology. Last month, a document leaked to the press revealed that the FBI wanted to block Huawei from using 5G technology. The document claimed there is insufficient security in Huawei equipment and that the company had a poor track record with regards to security, with its CEO admitting back in 2012 that it may never solve hacking threats to networks. But, the company has denied any wrongdoing. Despite growing uncertainty about Huawei, the company's founder has said he is not worried that the company will ever be banned from operating in the US.
