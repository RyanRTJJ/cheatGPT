These Brexit campaigners reminded us that they are in the public service, not as individuals but as elected representatives of Westminster for the entire British nation. It is in their interest to make a success of the exercise of delivering on referendums. The UK is a very different beast to the EU, with very different rules and different values.

Why do Labour Remain voters keep doing this? Perhaps it is to draw attention to their point that the vote was wrong as a whole.
