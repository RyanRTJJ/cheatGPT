 saying: "We have made it very clear that this company is not involved at all in any conflict in China, we don't collaborate with any type of government in any sector. We did some exercises with a couple of our customers, like the US military. So nobody has any relationship".

On Huawei-Gigablast relations, the new chief executive added: "The fact that there's so much interest in the company is in the US, but the fact that in the rest of the world people are interested and interested in the product – that shows we're serious about that.

"We think that at this stage that we have got a pretty good understanding with each of our partners, who are working on a lot of projects together.

"And they say the same thing about us – if I had a better chance to be in person, I'd like to do more things with them, but it would be a really great gift, I guess it's just because it would allow us to do the best we can. Even though we want everybody to be good to each other."
