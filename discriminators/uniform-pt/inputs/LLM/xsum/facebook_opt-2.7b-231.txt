Xiang Junfeng, vice-president of Wukong Bikes, said the company has been scammed by its former owner, who had an alleged interest in criminal activities.

"Many of us are deeply hurt but we still have hope," said Xiang, who added that he had been trying to contact police to get help in tracking down the missing scooters.

After two attempts to speak with police, Xiang said he had switched to the Wuhan Provincial Public Security Bureau.

The company has already filed for bankruptcy protection and is trying to restructure its operations.

It is looking for a new owner and is hoping it can get the scooters back within one week, Xiang said.

The company had started production in 2014 and was already riding high off a wave of positive publicity about its efforts to bring e-bike technology to China.

State-owned China Railway Equipment Corporation Corporation had partnered with the Wukong Bikes, as did Zhejiang Jianlin International Industry Investment Group, which was looking to promote electric bikes for long-distance travel.

Wukong Bikes claimed to have more than 1,200 electric models on the road in China.

The company's CEO Sun Yueqin and some other executives were reportedly arrested by Beijing police in May, according to reports in the Global Times.

Xiang said he did not think Wukong Bikes had broken any laws and did not know anyone in the company who had any connection with crime.

He added that he had been surprised by the scandal, as no one in Wukong's workforce could have been expected to take part in illegal activity.

"No one working or retired here has ever been involved in any crimes, and they all did not know each other well," he said.

Wukong Bikes posted a profit of 70.7 million yuan ($11.1 million) in 2016, according to the company's latest regulatory filing with Shanghai Stock Exchange.

Sun was also chairman of the company.
