 least 14 more girls are still traumatised after the crash. Another girl died days later at Glasgow University Hospital. The 16-year-old girl involved in the crash died in a hospital on Monday, 15 April aged 18. The family of 18-year-old Chloe Raine also died at age 23, as did their parents. The Rakes' father said: 'The whole family of them are traumatised.

Police had said they were looking at whether there was an alcohol or drug element in the crash. The five girls have had a month to come forward to the police. Dr Richard Thompson, a former specialist paediatrician and consultant psychiatrist said: 'These children could very well have suffered severe brain injury or die from this sort of event.' Dr Thompson added: 'I do not condone the extreme force'

The six-hour crash has been the scene of protests on social media and politicians have described the children's deaths as 'horrific'.

But police yesterday revealed their officers spent an average of one and a half hours following the vehicles, compared to an average of six hours in the initial search of the area. But a police spokeswoman said police had been in the field for three hours before the crash and that the police search had cost more than Â£10,000 compared to the original initial search. The family of the 12-year-old who died are believed to have been at home at the time or in the house when the crash took place last week.

There were more than 70 units in the area when police said the search began, including emergency services vehicles and units to support forensic work.

Barrack-Down officers found a black box, but have not yet been released because of the high number of deaths. Detective Chief Inspector Martin Green, of the West Mercia Police Command unit, said officers will now scrutinise the circumstances of the crash in "the most direct way for a long time".

The teenager's parents could not be reached as of press time.
