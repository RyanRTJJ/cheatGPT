, which took on added significance given the US president-elect's repeated references on the campaign trail to "self-funded" presidential candidates.

Mr Buffett also said he had spent $10bn in his lifetime, compared with Mr Trump's $4billion, because he had put $4 billion into Berkshire Hathaway.

Asked whether this sum would cover Mr Trump's tax bill, Mr Buffett suggested it would not.

"We've already paid more in taxes than we've gotten in return. We've put $4 billion into a tax haven," Mr Buffett said. "It's called Switzerland, you can go there and you don't pay taxes. So we'll be fine."

He said he had given $90bn to charity this year, putting him in the top 1% of Americans.

Mr Trump has argued he would have paid more despite the $916million he reported as income from 1995 to 2006 since his tax form lists it as a loss.

An audit by the IRS this year found he may have paid a lower tax rate or not paid income tax at all.

The billionaire business magnate said, too, that many of his big decisions during his lifetime had been in response for years to people giving to charities and other charitable causes, such as the Red Cross.


"We've never made a decision to do a charitable contribution that didn't take into account their willingness to give. We've done it all the time," he said. "When I had an idea, I would get together my children. They were the only one."

"They would say, 'Dad, what do you want to do?' I'd say: 'Let's give it a try. Let's go to a place the country can't afford to get into and see if there's a way that, if we can, that the money goes to those people,' so we made charity decisions that we thought were right for the American people."
