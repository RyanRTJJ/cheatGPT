 dissolved in alcohol, they report today in Nature Chemical Biology.

The remedy worked by creating an acid-free, hydrogen-deprived environment, said Daniela Raulelli, a postdoctoral researcher and researcher with the University of Trento's Centre for the Biology of Microbial Ecology.

Because onion and garlic are both sources of a strong enzyme found in the gastrointestinal system, it follows that these compounds could be used to treat conditions such as aflatoxins, viruses and other parasites.

This theory is supported by two studies, which have investigated the effect of combining garlic and onion on colon enzymes and their degradation in a well-understood microbial environment.

"The first was very interesting as it demonstrated that the onion was almost totally dissolved in alcohol and that is quite important from a metabolic perspective," said Raulelli. "When onion and garlic are combined, it works because the acid is going to break it down. This is quite novel and exciting because it means that these compounds are actually present in a highly acidic environment."

The second study used the digestive bacteria from a cow at the University of Leicester as its model. It found that after the fermentation cycle was completed, the bacteria began to degrade the mixture with a more acidic environment, which is a hallmark of a toxic environment, suggested lead author Adam McDevitt. The experiments looked at the ability of both types of microbiota to combat viruses and bacteria, as well as anaerobic microorganisms such as Proteus.

Because both food groups have components thought to promote growth and metabolism, they could have a role in treating conditions such as colon cancer, a common form of cancer in humans.

The researchers will now investigate the use of these compounds in clinical trials.

The experiment showed the onion and tomato could help to protect humans exposed to various toxic substances.

They also hope that their findings will provide clues for the development of a more efficient microbial management technique that can be used to counteract the toxic properties of bacteria. If this develops further, it could be practical
