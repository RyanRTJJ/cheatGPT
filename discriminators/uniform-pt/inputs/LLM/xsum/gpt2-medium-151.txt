 to give the Scottish Government "flexibility" on pricing under the NHS reforms proposed for 2015.

Dr Richard McAlpine, from RCGP Scotland, says the Scottish Government should be asking if they should accept NHS patient numbers going down even though the budget cut "has made absolutely no difference whatsoever as to safety".

In the context of the consultation period running from mid-September until mid-January there has been evidence from various organisations and a number of people of "serious concern" about the impact of health spending on the care of individuals.

It is expected there will be over 12,000 more primary care nurses in 2015, around 4,500 fewer mental health patients and a "large increase" in care of people with respiratory conditions. However, there is currently a gap of up to 400 beds.

Figures provided to Glasgow Live by Public Health Scotland suggest that around 50 per cent of people living in the city of Glasgow do not have access to adequate primary and extended medical care. That would affect the health of nearly 150,000 people living in the capital.

The Scottish Government has said it will take account of feedback from a wide range of stakeholders and "would seek to ensure health outcomes are delivered with the most appropriate support."

The RCGP Scotland consultation states: "It is important that the Scottish Government can ensure this funding is well distributed because it is necessary to ensure patients have access to essential health services and to reduce their risks of potentially life-threatening conditions."

In an analysis carried out for the Department for Health, RCGP claims an 18 per cent price rise for emergency healthcare across the UK, as a result of the spending plans unveiled in the 2015-16 Budget.

The analysis shows a price rise that will have an immediate impact on some people from the "very poorest social backgrounds", and will drive a higher overall average household debt than could otherwise have been the case.

It says cost pressures will be especially acute in hospitals over 2015-16 but it has already warned that these rises could be further increased if certain NHS trusts were "not able to meet a requirement in the Budget to raise hospital bed numbers".

Dr McAlpine added: "This should be part of the discussion if the Scottish Government is not
