m their families by the Franco regime and given to state-approved Catholic families in a practice known as "stolen babies". She called for an independent inquiry into the allegations.

Ruth Appleby's plea for an independent inquiry into the allegations of "stolen babies" was supported by the Spanish government, who acknowledged that the practice was widespread between 1936 and 1987, and that the issue is "neither denied nor silenced" by the country. It then requested the Spanish parliament to investigate the issue and decided to set up an independent committee to analyze documents and testimonies of those affected.

The committee published its report in October 2011 and confirmed that babies were systematically snatched from their parents during and after the Spanish Civil War. It estimated that around 30,000 babies were involved in the practice and that over 500 babies were stolen post-Franco. The Spanish government put in place a number of measures to help people trace the fate of their sons, daughters, or grandchildren, including allowing those affected to use DNA tests to identify family members.
