cture of events.

The complainants had not seen the programme before it was broadcast but were ‘made aware of it by staff in the warehouse’.

The BBC Executive Producer of Inside Out East Midlands said the programme had been “meticulously researched” and gave a fair and balanced account of the events. He said there was no evidence to back up the complainants’ suggestion that staff had been prevented from leaving the warehouse during their rest break, or that women had been forced to use the toilets for toilet stops. 

The BBC Executive Producer explained that the staff member giving birth in the toilets had not reported the event to management, and that the programme had included interviews with both the member of staff, and the manager involved. He said that the programme had clearly explained the circumstances surrounding the events, and that the programme makers sought to convey both sides of the story.

The Executive Producer added that the programme had not presented the story in terms of fault or blame, and that it was up to the audience to draw their own conclusions. 

The BBC Trust upheld the complaints, finding the programme was not impartial and the facts were not presented in a fair and balanced manner. The Trust also found that Inside Out East Midlands had failed to take into account all relevant facts that could have been used to provide a balanced and impartial account of events.
