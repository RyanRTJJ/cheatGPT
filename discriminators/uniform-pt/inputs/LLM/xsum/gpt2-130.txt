 100,000 people (see table, below).

The number of incidents has been decreasing over time, but has remained steadily upward for the first 20 years of drone use in an era of increasing surveillance. It's possible that the increase is due to advances in drones that reduce the need for the local population to report drone sightings.

It was also reported last year that the FBI recorded 581 per 100,000 people using drones worldwide in 2011. These figures are down 4% from last year, and are up 11% from 2013, who are just over 3,000. Another 10,000 people have become involved in drones worldwide or a few thousand in a year.

Last year (July 31) in total, 6,929 vehicles were recorded and 4,547 drones were involved in this last year. This represented a total of 12,300 reported incidents. Another 18,000 people were involved in drone issues, which represent a similar number of vehicles.

The largest problem for local or third party observers and witnesses comes when drones are not operating at will, although the FBI recently updated this standard to include remote-targeting technology in its new unmanned aircraft system. So far, the standard continues to increase as a result, and if you ask the US government, they will tell you there's already a lot to be learned.

According to the FBI, about 50% of the drone uses that occurred so far this year may be due to location-based tracking, according to statistics gathered from multiple law enforcement agencies.

"Many times the government doesn't respond to questions from interested customers and the business gets in the way of their business," said John Sorensen, Director of the US Department of Homeland Security (pdf). "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will need to provide these types of data, but it's important to note that if an investigation is conducted by private citizens with legitimate purposes, then it should not just be an investigation of a government employee or employee's use
