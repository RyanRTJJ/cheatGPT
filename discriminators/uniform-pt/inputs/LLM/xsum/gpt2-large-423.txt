The company also pledged to deliver the promised 6,800MW of green energy capacity from its new generation projects in 2016-17. This will be achieved by generating 5,720MW from a combination of solar and wind, or a mix of wind and solar. The company said it is committed to sourcing renewable energy through its new generation of wind and solar power plants.

"This has seen the creation a record 12 new wind turbines to date with further construction expected this year and in 2017/18 with another 16 expected after it has fully deployed the initial capacity in March 2017," said the company, which plans to invest £1.25bn in wind and solar energy capacity by 2020.

"This significant investment is needed to support Scotland's rapidly growing solar and wind markets which have seen rapid growth from just three years ago."

The Labour leader said it was a "clear demonstration of Scotland's power to be the world leader.

"The world-leading expertise of the UK Government are fully employed in the development of the renewable technologies available to us and the world's leading companies such as BP and Shell are collaborating on a number of projects with Scottish companies," he added.

"We need a government whose top priority is not just jobs but the economic security, social and environmental benefits of having clean power and low-emissions electricity," he added.

In a statement released afterwards, David Cameron hailed the success of the UK's renewable energy sector. He highlighted the £10m in subsidies for offshore wind which he had announced last December.

He claimed there are more than 12,000 turbines offshore around the UK – "a record" which, he said, was "one of the reasons why this industry is so attractive for new investment and jobs".

"We're clear that the UK should be leading the way on this, and we've announced new grants of up to £3bn to ensure that we can fulfil that ambition," he said.

Mr Miliband also hit out at the way green energy subsidies had been reduced in the Budget which will see their level drop even further.

He argued the changes would make wind and solar energy cheaper to consumers. "But that does not in any way take away from the
