 photographs were found on his phone on his arrest.

Robert Eason, 37, from Perth, had previously pleaded guilty.

Both men had their nine-year sentences suspended for three years.

At the time they were arrested, Morton had been remanded and Eason on bail pending sentence for the same offence.

Judge Gray left Morton with a six-month supervision period.

Eason was sentenced under the Criminal Justice Act.

The weapon they were found with was described as a Glock 9mm pistol.

Eason was found with another weapon, a Smith & Wesson revolver.

Both weapons had been legally bought but the pistols had been illegally converted to semi-automatic.

In a statement following the hearing, prosecutor Christine Wallace, said: "There can be no doubting that these two men carried out a deliberate and cruel act in carrying out what can only be described as a horrendous mass murder of at least six young men.

"The evidence showed that Robert had been planning a spree, to take place on the evening when these young men would be out in the evening spending time in the pub, and then in the early hours of the following morning to come and shoot them dead.

"The guns, along with the ammunition and a number of spare magazines, were found with them.

"And in that sense this was a very different crime to simply going out to the pub and drinking with friends on a Saturday night in September. It was a cold-blooded, planned act where they went along to the pub.

"They came back the next day and carried out that act of evil.

"The planning that was taken to commit this offence was just so appalling we had to give that serious consideration to the fact we needed to see these men locked up."
