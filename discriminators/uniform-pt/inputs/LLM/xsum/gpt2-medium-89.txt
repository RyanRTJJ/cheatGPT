 Mr Brown.

Prince Harry had to put on his clothes and went back to his room to dress for dinner the next day, the palace said. Before leaving that evening, he went to the beach with Prince Andrew and Prince Charles.

He went to another hotel by himself and had his shoes returned to him by a hotel security guard. The palace gave out photos of this encounter for two days, with the prince appearing again just a few days later in the same part of the palace.

Mr Brown later told the Sunday Times: "I was just a student. No one was looking. He came out of the building with his wife with my phone off." The prince's wife, Jane, a former model who is married, had been with him in a cab.

The pictures were found on the black market with a large amount of money â€“ $250,000, according to media reports.

The prince is said to have been furious at what he saw on the black market. The Royal Family were unavailable for comment.

It will not be the first time the prince had visited Hong Kong; he first visited the city in October 2006 to meet with local leaders. The royal family has also visited Hang Seng, the traditional site for the ceremonies which commemorate the Chinese independence from British rule in 1997. Prince Harry has visited Hang Seng twice in recent years and was joined by the king of Japan and leader of Turkey.
