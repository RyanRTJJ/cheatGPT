 fact that even at 20, he has an attacking ability, rather than an athletic one.

But there's another side to all this speculation. That his brother-in-law N'Dal, the former Tottenham defender who became a successful director of development at PSV Eindhoven, wants to turn the club's fortunes around. His nephew and son both represent the club's supporters base, while Celtic's hierarchy are all-out pushing for a transfer.

"You talk to everybody who knows their own players," added N'Dal. "I have three sons too, three beautiful grandchildren, but also you know that the fans and the clubmen have nothing to contribute, if I am correct. I have nothing to fear. What matters most is their legacy.

"But I do not think we have to worry about the transfer. What we have to do is to go out and support them. That is not something that, we know now, was a mistake, as we lost to Man United five years ago. To believe any other way is disrespectful and to believe the reason the club was so good with football is because of the fans that have come out to support us.

"I am very pleased that the Celtic manager has been able to turn this club's fortunes around and I know they will. I hope they do so with full confidence. It is a miracle there is more football to be played. We will be playing a great football, not just when everybody has got a new team in life. But when it comes to the boys, I want all the brothers to go ahead with the club."
