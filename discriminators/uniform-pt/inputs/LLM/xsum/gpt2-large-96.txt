 were also involved.

While no votes were cast in the vote, Sinn Féin were present behind his back, and voted in support. That included supporting a motion of no confidence in Mr McDonnell last September.

The motion was later rescinded.

Earlier this week it emerged that the DUP had received cash from the Northern Ireland government of £250,000 a week for eight months.

SDLP assembly member David Ford called for investigation after the latest revelations.

He told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme: "The DUP have accepted funding, payments, gifts on condition that they are supporting it by voting for the government and to be a vote machine.

"When the DUP are not voting for Sinn Féin the money stops being paid out and we have concerns about if that money is being used for lobbying.

''We also want an investigation to see if there is a breach of the LIFO Act which prohibits direct political or partisan fundraising."

'Good faith'

On Monday, the DUP's Stormont Affairs Committee approved a three page report which was authored by former Lord Chief Justice Sir John Stevens.

It was sent to the Stormont Assembly and Finance Minister Sammy Wilson on Monday.

It is designed to "consider the current situation relating to the allocation of public funds to the Assembly and its functions of government, and to provide a basis for future budget planning".

The report states there has been a shortage of money for a number of reasons. There has been a reduction in public sector employment and spending. Some of this money has been used for specific purposes.

The report recommends that the "funding of the Assembly should be reallocated according to a phased manner, which may not coincide with the election to the assembly".

The committee report says: "In particular, the current allocation of £300,000 (£150,000 for the Executive) is too small and should be increased to an approximate level of £450,000
