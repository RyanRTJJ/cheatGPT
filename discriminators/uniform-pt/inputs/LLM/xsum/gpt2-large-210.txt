 Scotland Yard found it was a case of the "unfit for schoolboy" syndrome with the father and grandfather "clearly ill suited for the role of father".

Baby Imran's father, Mohammed Imran, was a convicted rapist. The court heard that the boy's grandmother, Zamaia Imran, had admitted to placing him in foster care because it was "better than being a criminal".

Following the report, the CPS launched proceedings against Mrs Mahmood and Mrs Mahmood's former teenage son Zulma for neglect. The CPS added more allegations, including neglect, towards Mohammed Imran. His barrister, Nicholas Davies told the court that the man was the "great uncle" of the child. The man had been arrested in August last year and was on bail.

Davies told the court that Mrs Mahmood admitted the allegations and that Zulma was "overwhelmed" by her uncle's "unscrupulous" behaviour. He said: "I fear that he's not well enough to protect this boy from his uncle."

Mrs Mahmood has denied those allegations and said she did not know the boy was in imminent danger and was "clearly unprepared".

The boy's mother, Zamaia Mahmood was said to have also been "overwhelmed" by her "unscrupulous" actions because she had known him since he was aged three. He was admitted to HMP Wandsworth without his parents' knowledge in June 2001. He was "underweight and ill-prepared" for child safety in the children's home, her barrister added.

The woman's father, Mohammed Imran, has been charged with the theft of about Â£150 from a children's home. However, the CPS declined to continue with the case.

The CPS was also told by two other alleged victims that the woman had failed to take sufficient measures for their safety.
