 member of the US State Department counterintelligence unit, was said to have engaged in talks with Russian agents posing as a diplomat in order to gather compromising information on the official. Moscow has not claimed whether Mr Fogle was really a diplomat.

It follows a spate of expulsions by Moscow in August. Russian authorities expelled the US ambassador and staff members in an act of retaliation to the expulsion of Russia's spy chief.

It marks a dramatic deterioration in ties between Moscow and Washington since the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, and the subsequent expulsion of Russian diplomats by the UK and other Western states.

In 2014, then Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a law allowing Russia to expel US diplomats and to ban non-resident aliens, such as diplomats from the US or UK, who would act in the interests of another country.

A statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry accused the former diplomat of trying to recruit a Russian employee as a spy.

"The head of the US department of state for the Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics, Ryan Fogle, organised meetings with a representative of the Russian foreign intelligence service, engaged in negotiations on recruiting a Russian official as a Russian spy," the statement from the ministry said.

The ministry's claim that US diplomats have long been "looking to recruit Russian intelligence officers as agents" does not appear to be substantiated by previous reports.

Russian authorities also accused America's intelligence services of trying to recruit Russian citizens to spy for them, but did not specify which agency.

Mr Fogle previously worked as a senior programme officer in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs for the state department, Reuters reported. The bureau's Russia desk is based in Washington.

The news of his expulsion comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing a set of amendments to Russia's constitution that would enable him to run for a second presidential term for the 2018 polls.

The amended constitution would bring constitutional amendments to a nationwide vote before
