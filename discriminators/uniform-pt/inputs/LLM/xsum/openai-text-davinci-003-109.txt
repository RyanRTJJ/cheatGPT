 to take place between 00:01 and 23:59 on Tuesday 7 August.

RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said the union's negotiators had put forward a “workable framework” that could have paved the way for a resolution and an end to the long-running dispute over the role of the guard.

He said: “It is disgraceful that Arriva Rail North have chosen once again to ignore the opportunity to nail down a negotiated settlement. This refusal to engage and forced RMT reps to walk away from the talks makes it obvious that the company have no intention of moving the issues of guard safety, security and access at the heart of this dispute and no respect whatsoever for the essential role our members play in keeping the railway safe for both staff and the travelling public: the understanding which lies behind the guards role in the future of rail travel.

“The union remains available for meaningful talks but the ball is now firmly in Arriva Rail North's court. We cannot and will not stand by while the company attempt to bulldoze through their attack on the role of the guard and the important on-board safety function that our members provide.”

The RMT had initially planned a total of five days of strike action in August, but the union had agreed to suspend the planned action while talks continued.
