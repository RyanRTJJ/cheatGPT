 safe and decent regime.

Incidents of violence among inmates at HMP Exeter almost doubled in a year, with 647 incidents in the 12 months to June 2018 compared to 344 in the previous year. Self-harm incidents also rose in the same period by a third from 443 to 602.

Inspectors praised efforts to address serious problems, such as levels of drugs misuse, but concluded that progress had been too slow.

In a report published today (29 January 2019), Chief Inspector Peter Clarke said:

“Violence had increased substantially but staffing had not kept pace, despite best efforts to recruit additional staff. We identified a number of factors impacting on the level of violence, but there was no doubt that insufficient numbers of staff played a major part.

“This was exacerbated by the reluctance of many staff to compete violent incidents or to intercede swiftly where such incidents occurred.”

The inspectors found levels of assaults on staff had dropped but were still too high. They found there were not enough officers on duty to manage the two key wings, each of about 200 men. As a result, the regime was limited, safety was compromised and there was little real activity.

The report said:

“We saw little fromthe available education and work sessions to reduce idleness and prevent the associated boredom that can lead to an increase in violence.”

The inspection also raised concerns over the numberof physical interventions used to restrain or separate prisoners, saying some were not justified.

The report concluded that addressing these problems would require a substantial additional investment in resources and that the Prison Service had to take urgent action to tackle the issues.
