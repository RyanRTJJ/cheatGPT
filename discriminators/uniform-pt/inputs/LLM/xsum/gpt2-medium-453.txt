One in four adults suffer blood pressure with a systolic limit of 90 mm Hg or higher at their home or hospital, for instance. For diabetics, it's just 15%.

Loud talking

A new survey by Diabetes UK found the UK has the highest rate of heart failure in the developed world, with 45% of people dying from it annually.

In total 1.5 million people got advice during the six-year study period from the charity, which analysed 1.5m people who would otherwise not have needed it and another 800,000 for whom it hadn't been provided.

More than half of the advice came from people older than 65, and one in 10 received a treatment called a diabetastonist.

It is particularly recommended for those who struggle with the effects of an increased risk of heart disease, such as having type 2 diabetes, low levels of HDL cholesterol and abnormal blood sugar levels, said Andrew Green, diabetes director at Diabetes UK.

However, a survey by the charity found that "loud talking about high blood pressure might be difficult for some people, particularly older people".

He said: "Diabetes UK estimates that more than 40% of adults in the UK suffer blood pressure with a systolic limit of 90 mm Hg or higher at their home or hospital, for instance. For diabetics, it's just 15%.

"Some people are unlikely to improve over time, but can try and get the extra advice and this survey suggests there isn't much pressure from health professionals.

Diabetes campaigner Peter Jones said: "People in all age groups and conditions would feel at risk if their blood pressure continued to drop at regular level. People living with diabetes should know that we must fight the war against heart failure, and we know from this recent survey that the NHS has had a big boost in recent years if we are to cut diabetes. We need a coordinated national strategy to tackle the scale of the problem that we face.
