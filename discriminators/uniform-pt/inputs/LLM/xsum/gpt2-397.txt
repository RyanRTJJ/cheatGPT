A number of the side's players are also available for the challenge as they visit Nottingham Forest (15:30 BST) on Saturday, October 17, for an official training session.

As well as the pre-season, the South African squad are also ready to look to improve their home league standings with five matches remaining. They are looking to claim a point with a win on Friday and four points on Saturday as they prepare for their first-ever head to head on-field clash with the English Championship title-winning Leeds United on Sunday.

Ahead of the match, Nottingham Forest's Sam Thistle will be a factor in their success, albeit in limited fashion, as they will have a large number of players competing and need to do some of their homework but the squad is fully fit and determined to get the win.

"We want to have a solid, consistent run of results," said Thistle.

After all, they have the right players, it's football. Every team has it.

After the game, they will decide once again what is 'the most important thing in the way we play the game for the country'," said Thistle. "This is probably the most important thing to play for the team, to win all the titles.

"But it's important that we play well for the game, and to give the squad the advantage we can."

The club confirmed that it is planning an attack out of Lincoln Park in preparation of a four-point win over Leeds United on Saturday.

"We're going to run out of control first. We know there are many things that can go wrong on Saturday so we're going with everything we have," added Thistle.

"The Premier League is a big part of this game, and the Premier League is the second-biggest league, so we're going to be a little bit aggressive in getting in the game. That's what we're up against."
