 warned that the UK would not commit to any kind of ‘blank cheque’, and that the government would need to see a business plan providing costings and a detailed proposal before agreeing to back the endeavour.

The UK is the world’s centre for culture, media and sport, making it an ideal choice to host the convention. But any potential host must demonstrate that it has the capacity and resources to meet the event’s needs over such a long period. This includes being able to host delegates, partners and sponsors, ensuring excellent standards of catering and accommodation, and delivering a legacy of innovation and economic benefit.

The government is working with a range of partners, including industry and local authorities, to explore the key considerations when bidding for such a major event. While a number of factors need to be taken into account, economic benefit and regional investment must be particularly important to make it a success. 

The government will also need to carefully consider transport links, infrastructure and safety to ensure a trouble-free and efficient event. All relevant research and consulting advice must be gathered and submitted ahead of making any decision.

Despite the considerable challenge of ensuring the UK’s bid for the World Media and Sports Association Conference and Expo is viable, the enthusiasm to succeed Dubai and bring the event to the UK is clear. It is hoped that the bid for the convention will benefit the country and its people for years to come.
