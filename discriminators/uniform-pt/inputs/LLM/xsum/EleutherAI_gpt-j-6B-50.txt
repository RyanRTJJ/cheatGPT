 had seen ads for zero-time jobs that could be a start to a journey into employment. The government said the ads "encourage a level playing field, increase the employability of potential jobseekers, increase the demand for relevant skills and deliver real value for employers".

Some critics have complained they are misleading and offer zero-hour contracts "for free". Those who want to see the ads could have until February 6 to object because their regulator said it will also publish results on their impact by then. The ads will be accompanied by an information booklet, to be distributed at the same time, with tips for people thinking about a zero-time job.

"Today we say 'no' to the exploitation of workers, we say 'no' to the undermining of rights at work," the labour minister Frances O'Grady said. "We say 'no' to exploitation. We say 'no' to the 'for nothing' culture that is spreading across too many parts of our economy."

The information booklet warns: "A zero-hour contract may seem a bargain, but it could make you lose out financially or affect job security. You could end up working too much and too many hours."

The government said the average income from a zero-time job was less than Â£900 a week in early 2015. Critics have said the ads could widen the gap between working and not working at the heart of the UK's austerity programme.

Some people complain that zero-time contracts give them no certainty at all regarding how much they will be paid, what hours they must work, whether they have a contract and whether or not the job will end.

The TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "Millions of people know of the negative effects of zero-hour contracts and that's why today's adverts are of such major importance. Zero-hour contracts are essentially contracts that do not guarantee any employment rights at all, even for a person living and working in the UK.

"Yet, the government seems unwilling to give zero-hour workers the protection they need. We call on the minister of state for Business and the minister of state for welfare reforms, Amber Rudd MP, to tell us what work arrangements they will put on an equal footing
