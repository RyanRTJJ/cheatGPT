 which will give around 1,500 of the residents' homes and businesses new communal use - to be completed in May 2020.

Following the scheme approval, a new Â£20m street safety initiative was approved by the council in December.

The scheme, which is delivered in the short term, will protect residents and businesses from dangerous behaviour on and near the streets, and will be introduced on some roads in the next six months.

Following the new street lighting, residents will see footpaths being lit from April 2019.

Mayor of London Andy Burnham said: "This landmark scheme is one of many exciting plans that have been put forward by our local community to make the St Nicholas House area of Central London safer and more accessible.

"The scheme will see the creation of new communal space which brings a range of new facilities to the neighbourhood to benefit these local organisations.

"It will also provide new infrastructure which is integrated into the scheme, to make it easier to access for residents and shoppers.

"And it will be introduced across all of the road schemes in the vicinity - not just St Nicholas House. This represents a huge improvement for those who use or work on the surrounding streets - which will also be significantly safer."

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: "This project was enthusiastically endorsed by me as the Mayor of London and the UK Government, and works in tandem with other schemes and initiatives that we are already running.

"It is particularly exciting in that it will benefit several local organisations including St Nicholas House, who have been recognised as having the highest rate of crime in London.

"This has been a longstanding proposal of mine, as Mayor, to provide new, good quality street access that is integrated into local transport networks across the city, to make it easier for people to get around, and to facilitate the free flow of goods and people
