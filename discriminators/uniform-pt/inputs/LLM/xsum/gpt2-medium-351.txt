He added: "Any time someone gets killed or injured in a road accident, it has a huge impact on the community and communities." Police said he had not been seriously injured during the incident and it was understood Samwell suffered a broken skull, abrasions and burns, as well as multiple head injuries and a bruised arm.

His body was found by a passer-by on a road just outside his home in Tyneside, Manchester early on Saturday morning. Two men, both 32, have been arrested on suspicion of theft under £5,000, theft under £10,000, burglary of the property and criminal damage. Samwell had a suspended licence.

The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was said to have been walking along the path just outside his house on Saturday when he noticed Samwell's white Hyundai Sonata. Police are understood to be investigating the possibility that he had stepped over a dead body on the car's bonnet, but police refused to reveal the cause.

Murdoch was arrested on the grounds that there was an "entirely reasonable excuse" for his arrest and that police were satisfied their investigation "had been fully pursued, thoroughly investigated and concluded in an impartial manner".


At 10.20am on Saturday the force tweeted: "Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the tragic loss of Chris Samwell this morning." In the afternoon a statement said: "We can confirm that a 35-year-old man has been arrested by police outside his home on the A3, with investigations ongoing. Police say the circumstances of the incident are still too early to comment." A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: "There was an incident on the A3 between the junction of A8 and A9 between 11.40am and 11.55am last
