 while the median monthly wages for the top 10% of households were up 1.2%, or about 1.6% compared to the same month a month ago.

These results suggest that China's economic slowdown is continuing.

Last year the country's economy grew by less than 1% a year as the economy was hit by economic factors such as slowing growth in the retail industry.

However, while growth in commodity prices fell this month, the real growth in real output was flat.

Last month's Chinese GDP growth fell even further due to an unusually high GDP growth rate. But this latest data showed that the world was still in a recession, which has hurt the economy and contributed to the drop in the yuan, suggesting that the government will be able to cope. (China has a history of not keeping up rates in recent years.)

China's inflation rate at the end of this month was down 5.4%, with the Chinese central bank's benchmark rate falling to 3.85%, from 6-7.5%.

According to a report from the International Monetary Fund, China's economy has been slow in its recovery so far. However, it will be interesting to see how China's economy responds in the coming months.

The most important thing now is to continue to boost the domestic consumption of goods and services and ensure the sustainability of the economy as a whole.

This is critical. We cannot wait for China to hit the next peak of its social and economic dynamism right at last - a place that is capable of living up to its potential. The China experience is telling us something. If you want to know what may come next, read this interview with China's top policymakers.
