 5.5% in the same period. Nielsen reported holiday results last month, but did not reveal profits for the three weeks ending on December 2, a sign that margins look weak.

Sears saw profits for the holiday season plunge nearly 21% to $1.2 billion from $2.04 billion in the comparable period in 2011, while Kmart enjoyed a 14.2% rise in profit to $1.25 billion in the holiday week from $1.15 billion in the comparable period in 2011.

Toys R Us has seen net losses for six months in a row, though profits have increased. It has lost $1.15 billion in six months, compared to profits of $1.01 billion in the corresponding period last year.

Other retailers also saw the steepest decline in sales: American Apparel posted a 22.1% decline (to $15.87 million in its latest quarter) to close out the holiday season.

Toys R Us lost $19.4 million in its second quarter, but reported a strong holiday weekend, as sales rose 20.8% to $21.1 million. Overall sales increased to $4.5 billion for the three months ending December 2.

On January 7, Sears said that shoppers who placed their last order last year received a rebate of $50 (20% off the pre-tax price of a new gift on that day), with no obligation to return a purchase.
