The minister also said he would make a "hard decision" about whether he would attend a conference of ministers within weeks.

The remarks come after Mr Turner described Scotland as a "divinely-guided country" in an interview with Sky News. He added: "I'm worried that we could still be on the right side of history but people have told me that the whole European Union, the EU as an institution and not the United Kingdom is very much a part of our culture and this is not the case."

"That is very, very worrying," Mr Johnson told Sky News Scotland. "The Scottish nationalist is very dangerous and I am very concerned. If I were to go to a conference of ministers with the UK Government which is a part of the European Union and say we don't think so, that's a very dangerous thing to do."

He added: "If I were to go to a conference of ministers – which is a very close and very effective and important political venue and there are so many great Scottish Ministers in government – I would be very very worried. It might take many weeks for me to decide if I will speak in front of people.

"I think you are in for a very nasty thing. I think you are going to be looking for the next government where you have people who are well prepared to make tough call and the fact that people understand that is not going to be easily dealt with."

He said he had spoken with Lord Mayor about taking part in a "very important" Scottish government conference. After a meeting he said he did not understand why "most ministers – probably most of the country – are not prepared to listen to the needs and aspirations of their constituents".

Lord Mayor was quoted by the News.
