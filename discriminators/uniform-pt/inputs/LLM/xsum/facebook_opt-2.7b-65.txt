"I thought that this year was going to be so different from all the years before. Instead, now there's no Christmas," she wrote.

"My world is collapsing around me... I can't breath. My heart is breaking. For the last four years, Christmases have been the best days of my life. I love you all so much."

A statement on Friday from the coroner's office reported Scott's full cause of death as multiple blunt force injuries caused by a fall, and concluded she had died from complications of acute methamphetamine toxicity.

There was no sign of sexual assault, and police said there was no foul play at her home.

In her message to friends on Facebook, who have taken to her friend's Facebook page to leave tributes since her death, Scott's daughter wrote: "If you hadn't seen her post today you would think she was doing great, it was nothing but happy posts. So many people are just praying for us. No one would expect someone like her to give up on life like she has lately."

Friends and family told police they last saw Scott alive while she was out celebrating her 40th birthday with her family on Saturday night.

Her disappearance drew national headlines within a day and was treated as a missing persons case. Her body was found early on Monday in a suitcase on a road in north London.

Two arrests have been made. A 51-year-old man from east London was arrested on suspicion of murder on Thursday, following reports Scott died as a result of assault, and a 47-year-old man from Bethnal Green, east London, was arrested on suspicion of murder on Friday on suspicion of the same offence.

Scotland Yard said a joint investigation with the London Ambulance Service and Met police is ongoing.
