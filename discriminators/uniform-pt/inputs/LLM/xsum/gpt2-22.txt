Wages are expected to be affected as a result of air travel and taxi services going out and back.

Mr Duncan said: "Air travel is an absolutely critical part of the UK's economic development.

"The Government's planned changes will provide millions of jobs, strengthen public investment and extend investment in the UK economy.

"As part of this plan, the economy will be significantly upgraded by the changes which will support job creation and growth."

The Government has been under pressure over the budget and has hinted its new investment plans may come as a threat to business and to the economy. "The Government has warned that the Government's plans to cut business and investment spending in the past three decades will have the effect of creating a Â£14.6 billion shortfall to the UK budget," the Prime Minister's Office said. Meanwhile, a Treasury report today revealed there are more than 5,200 redundancies amid an eight-month period of uncertainty.

A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said that the figures do not include any redundancies at government-run airports due to "the ongoing uncertainty over airports policy.

"We will consult with industry, transport associations, public bodies and other stakeholders before making any further decisions about how our air travel policy will operate for the next 40 years. The Government welcomes the data and the ongoing review to ensure that we do things right."

But the Treasury said it had been "surprised" by recent figures out of the Cabinet Office.

It said the number of people employed by government contracted airports during 2014-15 was 783,000. "That would be 5,200 fewer than in June 2012 and 783 fewer than in October 2012, which are similar to the estimated 10,200 or 5,200 fewer workers at our busiest airports during the same period.
