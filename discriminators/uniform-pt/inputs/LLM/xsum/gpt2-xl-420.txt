 most economically disadvantaged youngsters could still do well at English A-levels and gain better secondary school standards. The research, by the Sutton Trust, the largest charity working in this area, was released as a bid by the Prime Minister and Education Secretary to promote more high quality schools. The study, published last week, looks at the prospects of 462,200 children at age 11 in 2014. The findings show boys are more likely than girls to pass at A-level and to gain GCSEs in reading, writing and maths. But, as the researchers note, the figures also show that many of the poorest children had "considerable odds" of attaining those high standards. The Government is planning to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to help increase the numbers of poorer children taking part in English A-levels. Some of the recommendations in the report, published today, will raise fears among senior politicians that the best-off will simply end up playing catch up with the poor: One suggestion is to make A-levels a "target" subject that pupils can be required to pass to gain access to university. However the Trust said that was not an easy solution but recognised that "a strong policy message is needed to help build a culture for excellence".

So they don't have a solution. In a separate study, the Sutton Trust found that for boys who achieve the average grade in English, maths, Science and History, their chances of going to university are about the same as those of boys from deprived backgrounds who do not achieve these grades. In other words, it's possible that children from wealthier families will be more successful in schools than those with less resources which will leave the poor children behind. Now there's certainly no doubt that we need to improve the education of the poorest in this country. There are some very good initiatives being piloted which are working well. There is no doubt that the system is broken but I'm not aware of anyone who would suggest that it is deliberately broken in order to ensure that there can be no chance for the poor children.
