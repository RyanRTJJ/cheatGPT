keithing and Portlaoise were there to pull it from the water.

The boat was towed out from the harbour on Thursday.

A spokesperson for the UK Coastguard said the ship had been boarded by rescue teams and would be taken ashore.

Two vessels - one British, one Irish - have been left with more than 80 casualties, according to police.

Those injured included a three-year-old boy and nine people who took part in an outdoor music and yoga class which was held at the popular port city's popular O'Connell's Irish pub.

Those in the classes included singers, drummers, dancers and other musicians.

'Most tragic day'

Coastguard officers said many of the injured were airlifted to hospital.

"There's a total of eight people in hospital, including the three children that were in the class," an officer said.

"A young family fell to their death when a Reaper capsized - there was just two people that managed to escape the vessel.

"Fortunately, nobody else was hurt, it has hit a reef along the way.

"There's a total of 84 people from the various classes - they have been sent all over the country."

Officers said the vessel would be towed out and its sinking could take some time due to the size of its cargo.

Last year, a similar Reaper came dangerously close to making landfall in West Scotland.

But the wave that battered the vessel, on its way to Portmagee, did not break until it nearly reached the shore.

Its captain escaped, a passenger suffered severe injuries and the ship's fuel went off.

And in September of last year, two ships collided in the Severn estuary.

Four people, including two children, were killed in that incident while a further eight people were injured.
