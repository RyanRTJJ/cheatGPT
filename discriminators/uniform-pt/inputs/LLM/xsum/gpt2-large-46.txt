, she will not go to the Games, but if she is unable to participate then the same principle applies," said the German Sports Confederation (DOSB).

Dopers have a long history of entering and winning the Grand Prix, which was first introduced in the 1970s when Germany won its first Grand Prix. In recent times, there has been a trend of Russian athletes coming to Stuttgart and competing on the home soil.

A spokesman from the Russian Olympic Committee said the federation was already monitoring the situation. "We believe it's natural that athletes on the doping list, or that have tested positive in international competition, would be given clear opportunities to participate in Olympic sports or sports activities. We are ready to respond to this offer," said Evgeny Trenin.

The IOC would not comment during their meeting on the proposal, saying that they are still waiting for the Stuttgart ruling and would wait until the next Olympic cycle before making a decision on it.

Russia has denied doping its athletes and is seeking a return to Olympic participation, claiming that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is biased against Russia. Some members of the Russian delegation have blamed the Russian Ministry of Transport and the Federal Anti-Doping Agency for allowing the cheating to continue.

The IOC will select four teams from the 16-country FIFA World Cup qualifying group to represent the United States, Italy, Canada and the Netherlands in December, in preparation for the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea. The four teams will meet in Pyeongchang for a single set of qualifying matches.
