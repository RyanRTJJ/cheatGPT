 Malaysia

When Lewis Hamilton said after Mercedes' home grand prix that he needed to close the gap on Nico Rosberg and "show him how it's done" in order to "close the gap in the constructors' championship", that was the biggest compliment you could pay his team.

But Hamilton has a big task here in Malaysia, on the winding streets of Sepang, to finish anywhere other than second - but he is on more than decent ground to do just that.

Rosberg must finish further back in fifth place or lower, to be second and not the championship leader.

At present the German is 53 points ahead while Hamilton is 57 behind. In order for Hamilton to take the championship Rosberg will need to finish second this weekend because of the greater number of points scored in the race than a win.

A second place finish for Rosberg here will secure his third title and there is every possibility the German could close the points gap even more in the next three races, with Hamilton in Canada and the USA and Rosberg in Russia and Spain.

Hamilton has already stated that he will do what he has to to ensure the gap in the championship does not get any bigger.

A win will move Hamilton back within 15 points of Rosberg in the final four races and a second place finish could do the trick.

It is, in some ways, inevitable that Hamilton, who had such a good season in 2015, will find it difficult to replicate that feat - the championship is a close one and it will take some spectacular and surprising heroics to end it.

At the moment we are not even at the halfway point. This could go through the back of that garage door - you can feel the pressure building. Mercedes are going to do something amazing and I hope Lewis does something amazing at the end - he has always delivered on big occasions.

It is now time for Hamilton to put his Mercedes head in front of his McLaren heart

He is a great driver and at
