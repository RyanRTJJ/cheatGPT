 the weekend.

We won't have any time to lose in the build up to this one. It's another big game against something that's strong in strength. And we have to keep our cool. They are a fantastic side too, which means I know when we play against them, we have got to be ready to fight. When you are looking at something like that, you put a lot of hope in the manager and team in the short space of time. We could have been on that list, but we're not on that list anymore. We haven't got those kind of things going for us at the moment. We have just to be ready, we've just got to grind them out.

Clement said there were positives this year.

I didn't have to think about the result but as I've said I think we have some positive things that we still have to clean up. Certainly we need to find out how we are getting on in the fitness department. My belief is we will be in a good position and that we have got some really good players in that room.

There was some concern at the start of the season that the style of play was not as well received by the fans and the players (who have been in the Premier League since 2005). This season seems to have come a lot easier.

The Saints have never been the first team you think they would be in any other position playing at the highest level. But you've got a team, as did the Swans, that is at a place in their history, in their league, but they've never quite got that confidence. This isn't to say those players are the worst in the league, but these guys are very hard working and you don't get that by merely winning a game like this. You've just got to look at the stats and see where you are in the league
