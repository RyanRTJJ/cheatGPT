 "didn't deliver on the pledge of more help to work, particularly to people who are disabled, in the last parliament".

"Our approach is quite simple – that when you get a disability you need support and we want to give you that support," she said. "This is a very real option for most parents."

The SNP has been accused of lying about disability benefits as it attempts to attract disgruntled Tories.

The party's deputy leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has repeatedly said that those receiving incapacity benefit who are unable to work but who are looking after themselves must be expected to take up "additional responsibility" which will be overseen by social care professionals, who will collect and analyse data to assess people's needs.

The welfare system is currently under government scrutiny following David Cameron's pledge to abolish the tax break for low-paid workers who choose to claim incapacity benefit.

In addition to claiming incapacity benefit, many people pay into the social security system through employment support allowance (ESA). The government has promised to cut the "bedroom tax" – another benefit that is based on individuals' average household income, but is used by some working households to meet the care-to-work criteria – to just £20 a month for each adult. This would mean that families with an income of £30,000 a year would need to drop their ESA payments.

The Conservatives have also called for the end to the "bedroom tax". The party is calling for a universal social housing benefit – which is not based on a household's income – that will cover the whole of the UK's housing needs, not just in a specific area. It would also give people to work through additional responsibility, including in social care settings.

However, in its manifesto published in July, the SNP was clear that it will stick to its manifesto commitment to reduce the income tax free personal allowance. At the same time, the party says it will try to help the "most vulnerable"
