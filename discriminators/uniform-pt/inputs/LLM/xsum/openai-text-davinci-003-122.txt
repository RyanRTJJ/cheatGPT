Khatkar was sentenced to 11 years in prison in May 2014 for various offenses, including rape and assault. His victims ranged in age from 34 to 61 and included a vulnerable learning-disabled woman.

During his sentencing, he was described as a “dangerous offender” and a “predatory male.” Judge Robert Egbuna said Khatkar had “terrorized” the city of Derby with his “violent and predatory behaviour.”

Khatkar’s sentence included a lifetime ban from entering Derby, and he was also placed on the Sexual Offences Register.
