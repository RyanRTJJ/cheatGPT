 are the primary beneficiaries of IRNSS. India has already reached out to these nations for cooperation in utilizing the system for their own benefit.

The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) comprises a constellation of seven satellites, of which three are already in orbit. The others are scheduled to be launched over the next few years. IRNSS uses a unique combination of dual frequency bands, L5 and S-band, to accurately pinpoint the geographical location of any user. This precision is ideal for navigation and timing applications. The Indian government is working to make IRNSS a regional gold standard and share its resources with the five regional partners. 

IRNSS will become operational once all seven satellites have been successfully deployed, providing a regional alternative to the United States' Global Positioning System (GPS). The long-term goal will be to develop an international navigation system, as called for by the International Civil Aviation Organization. By availing regional-level precision navigation, IRNSS will benefit a variety of sectors including aviation, marine and land-based communication systems. 

In addition to leveraging IRNSS for their own applications, the regional countries are invited to participate in the systemâ€™s future enhancement and initiatives. India has proposed to the regional countries exchanging data from ground-based receivers, which would allow the correction of satellite-based positioning signals. This brings the opportunity for the nations to make use of IRNSS and serve as contributing partners in its further development.
