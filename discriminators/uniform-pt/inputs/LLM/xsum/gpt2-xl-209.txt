 time that the initiative can offer micro-loans to a wider number of people than its micro-finance pilot programme in Pakistan.

The GCU has also helped to finance micro-finance by issuing loans, or loans guarantees, to banks in the UK. The loans are loans of up to £120,000 that are guaranteed by the loans fund, with the funds being used to finance the costs of providing credit to people in the micro-finance sector.

The new initiative brings together the activities of multiple organisations, including Glasgow University, Glasgow Trust and Glasgow Caledonian University. It allows the micro-lending network to work more closely, and with greater commitment, with Glasgow Trust.

The organisation's chief executive, Dr Romesh Ranganathan, praised the work of GCU's loan arm, the Loans Guarantee Corporation (LGC), which is also part of a UK-wide loan guarantee scheme.

Sadiq Khan, the shadow chancellor, said: "Gordon Brown's failed flagship education policy could be bringing back the days of debt bondage. This initiative is set to demonstrate that our new Labour plan for education can tackle the roots of poverty and inequality and deliver long term solutions.

"These loan guarantees, alongside the new loans scheme, will help provide much-needed short-term financing to help those who are currently struggling to support their families.

"Micro-finance, while often seen to be a panacea, continues to be controversial and has a particularly bleak record. Our proposals will ensure micro-finance is providing a route back from poverty, providing work for some and a sustainable alternative to debt. We must do our best to ensure this vital programme works to its potential from now on."

Professor Lesley Cooper, Director Education, Skills and Employment at Glasgow Caledonian University, said: "The Scottish government is committed to providing support to families who lack income and assets to make ends meet.

"With £60 million of support and a new micro-finance pilot scheme, we are determined to tackle the complex issues the micro-lending sector is facing in Scotland."
