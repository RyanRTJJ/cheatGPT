 for a number of reasons.

The government has made it up of several governments to fight terrorists, with Welsh government officials responsible for vetting the Syrian refugees, saying there are "well over 1000" arriving in the country, and the government is not able to do "anything to stop them".

Cameron suggested that "the next two years should be an issue whether it is enough to help and ensure we are going in the right direction".

Greens leader Bill Shorten criticised David Cameron for saying "we need Â£100m of help for refugees" and suggested refugees should be moved overseas if they did not want to stay there permanently.

Mr Shorten said "in order for the state to really work".

Some 30,000 Syrian refugees have arrived in Kent - the largest number in Britain. The government has received "numerous declarations of intention" but "no concrete action". The UK has sent in "a number of people from the Balkans", according to an Associated Press report.

This comes after other groups at the Conservative Party conference urged a more open attitude to refugees including immigrants, and refugees being given a chance to seek asylum and work, The Independent reported just last month.

Mr Shorten criticised the cabinet's inability to take any action to prevent "this disaster".

Speaking after meeting with UKIP leader Nigel Farage, he said the government had refused to act before it was "the country of the people".

Mr Shorten also argued for the government to consider "whether to continue to welcome immigrants from Syria and Iraq and not let it be seen how many Syrian who want a job and want a place in our country will come forward".

He added: "I think the only way to do it is through an open, credible and responsible process of vetting refugees from the Middle East and North Africa coming from Europe who want to come and work for us and not to be pushed through by
