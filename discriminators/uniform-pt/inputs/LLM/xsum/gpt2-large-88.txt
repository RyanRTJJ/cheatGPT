C is able to compete effectively in Welsh speaking areas nationwide.

Bafta TV has also been criticised following its decision to ban shows including Doctor Who and Broadchurch. It was revealed plans to bring back Doctor Who were dropped last year after the BBC's own ratings and fan responses indicated it should be reintroduced.

The committee is concerned there are concerns about the BBC's capacity to deliver its vision for S4C as a commercial player. It cites the difficulties facing BBC1 as one such failure, with recent coverage of the European Championships also being considered "at odds with the BBC's goals of cultural diversity".

It also said S4C has been criticised for its "lackadaisical" response to what it called the "new" media. The committee said the corporation has "shown little interest in addressing and responding to media trends" and that its response to cyber crime is a "major concern".

It added: "It seems to us the BBC has forgotten the new realities of the internet, particularly with access to content not only through the television, but also through online platforms like MySpace, Twitter and Facebook. It could not have been clearer in making its public statements that the BBC is firmly committed to its public service mission. But while the broadcaster has shown little interest in addressing and responding to media trends, it has not shown anything resembling concern about the lack of investment in digital media in Wales."

The report said such a lack of commitment was concerning, as Wales will need more television services on digital platforms if S4C is to remain competitive in emerging communities across the country. It also said the current generation of Welsh people does not need all of the content available on its television services.

The report suggested the BBC should put more funding into broadcasting programmes of national interest rather than the BBC Two and BBC Wales channels. The committee also called for more investment in S4C's science and digital services.
