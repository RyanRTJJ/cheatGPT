 it said would "remove any uncertainty around potential joint projects".

"As a result of this consultative exercise, we are fully focussed on ensuring NMW receives relevant advice when considering its participation in the new project," it said in a statement.

This week some of the bodies in charge of historic property, the Historic Wales group, sent out a joint letter saying it was looking for more details.

It suggested a separate "independent board" would be needed to look at the possibility of an acquisition of the historic sites.

"We think it is fair to say that NMW needs to look seriously at the role that Historic Wales could play," the members wrote.

The Welsh government said the government was "concerned about potential conflicts of interest" arising from the proposed transaction as part of the Historic Wales project.

A department spokesman said: "One thing is certain: We are currently in discussions with NMW on the possible joint development of these two important historic sites from historic to modern."

It said any new government department would need to identify which local authority already owned one of these sites of interest.

The UK has lost more than one million structures over the past 30 years and more than 150 historic properties have been damaged or collapsed since World War Two. Several are on the list of properties "for sale by eminent domain" on a "bid-and-take" basis because of their historic importance, according to the Historic England Forum.

Among the locations are the Roman, German, Spanish and Roman Catholic crossroads of Norwich and Swansea, the Roman Colne road and Caernarfon, the ancient fortress at Battersea Park and the original home of Queen Victoria and Prince Edward II.

NMW has more than 100 historic properties in Wales.

In November 2016, the company agreed to accept its first capital grant from the government after the Conservatives were weakened by their failure to get the controversial EU accession talks done when they were elected.
