 The figures were announced in a news release by the group.

In London, average weekly like-for-like sales were up by 7.6% from the previous year in the Capital region, and 9.3% in the South East. The growth was led by clothing from Marks & Spencer (up 3%) and Ocado (up 2.9%) at the top of the market, while food sales were up 1.5% at the end of the year, compared with last year.

In the rest of the UK, like-for-like sales were up 0.3% over this time period. They were strongest in Yorkshire (up 6%), Wales (up 3.1%) and in Scotland, where average weekly sales were up 1.9%.

However, like-for-like sales were flat in Northern Ireland after a 0.9% fall in the previous 12 months, whereas like-for-like sales were down by 1.7% in London and 0.1% in the South East.

The report, which is seen as a key indicator of consumer confidence and spending, measured average daily non-store sales by using store sales information and a similar survey carried out by the BRC in April.

Unlike the likes-for-like report, the store sales figures are based on the most recent available figures.

The retail report is calculated each month ahead of the official Easter long weekend on the final Sunday of April, when retailers sell a record number of products for the high-street sales season.

In their press release, the retail leaders said that, as the sales of household goods were off the growth for the fourth month in a row, UK retailers are facing a bleak and competitive environment. However, they hope to see their stock levels growing again later in the year.

The figures will certainly help retailers to make their case to market regulator the PRA, which will have to decide as to whether to continue to accept, or amend, the data for the final quarter of 2015.

The latest BRC/KPMG retail report, which tracked trends before the Easter sales period, will most certainly help the market to plan for a weaker shopping period later in the year.
