The verdict: This statement is misleading. The UK has taken part in the EU's Common Agricultural Policy and receives funding from the CAP - but its membership has ended on 29 March 2019.

A vote to leave the EU will not automatically end all EU support for farmers and producers.

The statement in full:

We don't control who gets money - we only decide how much.

But this is wrong. The UK does not decide whether other European countries receive public funding.

Since the 1950s, UK has played an important role in the European Union as member states have voted on major decisions made by the EU.

Withdrawing from the EU means ending our influence in Europe altogether.

Why does the UK have to fund farmers if we leave? Why can't we just decide ourselves how much we get back?

As we leave the EU we can start to decide things for ourselves again.

When we leave - we can decide on our future relationship with the EU.

We can get back control over the budget.

We will no longer pay money to Brussels to run a Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).

We can spend money on our NHS and schools.

On 29 March 2019, the UK will be no longer member of the European Communities.

This will mark the end of 55 years as an active member of the EU and will free us to make our own decisions.

It will also end UK involvement in major EU policies.

It will make us stronger, and allow to us start to chart a new path for our own country.

What if our farmers need more money? We will be able to decide how to spend our money to meet the needs of our farmers.

And since the final vote, Leave supporters have argued that the country should leave the UK's obligations to the European Union.

In addition to the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the UK receives funding from Europe's Economic and Monetary
