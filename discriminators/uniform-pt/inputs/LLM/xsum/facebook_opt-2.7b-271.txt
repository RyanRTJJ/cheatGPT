're not worried at all, he's just going to get some rest and recovery time," said assistant coach Rob Baxter before the game.

"He'll do a wee bit of rehab on it and see how he is, and then we'll decide whether he's up for the challenge at Twickenham this week, but I don't think he's going to be a long term injury."
