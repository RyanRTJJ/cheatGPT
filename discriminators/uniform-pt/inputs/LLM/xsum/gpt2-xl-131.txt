 has cut power to 300,000 homes.

But Mr Crouch, 54, said his life had changed since the disaster at the plant, with "no day off in a week" since the accident on March 17 at 4.45pm.

"I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy," he said in a phone interview. "I've got a couple of heart attacks."

He first was evacuated from his home and lived in emergency accommodation, when he was brought to hospital "because people would throw things at me".

"It's a hard thing to think about, but you have to," he said. "You've got a lot of people who suffer a lot from the stress and you want to do everything to help."

He met Mr Smith on an event at a care home, and said they were reunited after the fire.

"It's been a whirlwind, it'll go down in history," he said.

He has since moved into his own home and is getting to grips with having a job again after being "forced into it". "I had to work with a machine that burns people," he said.

Mr Crouch had been due to talk further at an event on Wednesday in the north east, but his travel plans have been cancelled, he said.

"Some people I spoke to earlier came back to remind me what happened to their lives, for some of them the shock isn't over," he said.

The fire engulfed the two-storey plant on the outskirts of Hulme, about 22 miles from the Cheshire town of Stockport, just after 4.30pm on March 17. Police said it is "still possible that more people are dead".

A further 20 people were still unaccounted for after firefighters arrived at the plant as the blaze grew to a huge inferno. Fifteen of those were confirmed dead, while 12 were still unaccounted for until today.
