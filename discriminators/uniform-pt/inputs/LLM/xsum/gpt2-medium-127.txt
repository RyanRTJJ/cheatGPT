"The New York Times has been a strong advocate for diversity in its print editions. By focusing on the work that is worthy, in the spirit of the Highland Clearances, it's going to create a year for a whole new generation," Joyner said.

Joyner will be doing the writing on the second instalment, with the editor and reporter Deborah Koehn doing the original, with the art team from HarperCollins publishing.

"Both the editor and I were very inspired by the film In the Time of Cholera as well as the work of Barbara Henderson. We have enjoyed watching her tell her stories both in the film and the book and hope to take her and her team on the same journey into the unknown of life in the present day. As we move forward, we are committed to exploring diversity and inclusion in the books and articles we publish," said Kathy Gendron.

For now, there is a page containing a link to the new issue, which has already sold out. The book will be released on September 27, after the upcoming Halloween holiday, though many of the books are available for purchase immediately after publication.
