-Catholics are charged the full bus fare.

The Government’s free bus pass scheme has been a success, which means that most pupils in England do not have to pay for school transport.

The Conservative MP Stephen Twigg said that he is “pleased” it has been extended to help get children to school.

“I am pleased that the extension of free bus travel for some of our poorest children is being announced today,” he said.

“In Flint, only about half of the children live within three miles of the school, so I’m pleased that this new scheme will make a difference to many of our poorest youngsters.

“The Government must stop these cynical attempts to raise taxes while increasing the cost of living.”

The Government’s National Student Travel Scheme for children aged between 5-18 years-old will be extended to help more youngsters with transport, the Department for Education has said.

The scheme, which will see free bus travel and discounted school meals extended to disadvantaged school-aged children aged between 5-18, will be extended to those from families which do not include a primary-aged child in March, instead of June 2017.

The extension – if approved by MPs on the Education Select Committee – follows an extensive public consultation which saw a record number of people support the move.

“The public support for this scheme is overwhelming given that it will continue to save the Government millions of pounds and make travelling to school more affordable for most children,” a joint statement from the Department for Education and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said.

“That’s particularly true for those families with a low income. We will now extend the National Student Travel scheme to include all pupils from eligible households before June 2017, which will provide more children with the freedom they need to get to school.

“This means children in England will still be able to travel for free to school or college to start a new term, despite coming from a household in receipt of certain benefits.”Read More
