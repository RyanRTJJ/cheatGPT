 there has also been an upgrade to the grassed areas at the corner of the race route and at the main entrance.

The money was awarded through Sport NI’s Bikes for Benefits programme and aims to help keep the races close to those in the constituency who can enjoy them.

Mr Black added: “Sport NI has been a long-standing supporter of the Motorcycle Race Calendar and, as soon as the news broke earlier this year that our NW200 would be the beneficiary of the Bikes for Benefits funding, we felt it was only right that the event was to benefit the constituency. I am sure it will be a popular event during the year.”

A meeting was held this week attended by a number of groups who represent the local area.

Councillor Robert Bracken, who sits on the council and represents the area on the North Down Area Committee for Sport Ireland, said: “Sport NI and the Bikes for Benefits programme enables people across the country the opportunity to enjoy and participate in events like the North West 200.

“This funding will help the NW200 to create an even brighter future and will ensure that all will have the opportunity to come and enjoy the races.”

A total of 12 sports are covered under the Bikes For Benefits programme which aims to build communities, support sporting success and benefit the health and happiness of sports enthusiast across Ireland.
