 room I was very happy to be part of it," said the former Worcester City and Doncaster Rovers man. "It has been an unbelievable experience since I first got a cap, coming here and just being part of it. This has been a long time coming. The game has been fast-paced."

Reece Burke has never taken a holiday. The 21-year-old winger has travelled the world over the past two years, representing England at senior level. Now he has his dream. "This is the best thing that has ever happened to me," he said, after helping England beat Australia in the World Cup final in Brisbane. "I have been dreaming about it for the last three years â€¦ This is the culmination of all my dreams and I am just here, speechless."

At just 21 years of age, Reece Burke is a natural footballer. He spent the summer in the United States playing for New York Red Bulls II, the first team for the US side in the Major League Soccer. "We are an English club and I thought I would get an opportunity playing for the US side but we did not get along," he said. "It is a bit of a different style but I had always been keen to play as much as I could."

With the Red Bulls II, Reece Burke won promotion to Major League Soccer after 16 appearances in his rookie season with the Under-23s. Then, when they qualified for the Eastern Conference play-offs, they were eliminated in the semi-finals by Columbus Crew. "My mum came and supported me in that game. There was a chance I would just miss out with the senior team. It is tough keeping your head down but you get in the team and that was that."

Reece Burke is making history for the country of his birth. In Saturday's World Cup final in Queensland, the 21-year-old scored two tries that capped a remarkable performance.
