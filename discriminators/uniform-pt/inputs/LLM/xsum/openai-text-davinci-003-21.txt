attempt at world honours.

DeGale was cut twice in the opening round, before rallying to become the second British boxer to hold both the IBF and WBA super-middleweight titles.

The two-weight world champion, who first held the IBF belt after outpointing Andre Dirrell in May 2015, has now set his sights on becoming the undisputed champion of the world.

“I’ve done it in style, I out-boxed, out-fought and out-thought him,” he said after the fight. “I’m delighted - I had the courage, the power and the will power to get through it. 

“I was expecting to win the IBF title and I knew I had a good chance of unifying the belts. Now I’m gunning for the World Boxing Council belt too.”

DeGale's ambition to unify the 168lb divisions pits him against WBC champion Badou Jack, while the winner of WBO champion Billy Joe Saunders' title fight against Martin Murray will have rematches with Degale and Chudinov vying for the championship.

Despite the challenges ahead, the former Olympic gold medallist believes that he can take his place amongst Britain's boxing greats.

“I want to establish a legacy for British boxing and be the best ever British boxer,” DeGale added.

“I’ve unified the divisions at super-middleweight and I want to now move up and become a three-weight champion. I want to challenge the likes of Bernard Hopkins, Joe Calzaghe and Carl Froch.”
