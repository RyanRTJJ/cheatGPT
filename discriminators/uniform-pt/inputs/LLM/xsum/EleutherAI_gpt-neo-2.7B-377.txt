 Bureau of Meterics and published on Monday from the Central Weather Bureau at the Ministry of Home Affairs show the state’s primary production in December was 1.6 million tons — the highest since December 2008, when the figure stood at 2.0 million tons.

The BEM said, though, that the year-on-year growth rate was “much lower” than in the previous two decades. Last year, the annual figure was 3.24 million tons — a 16 per cent rise from a year earlier. December 2010 was the least productive state with a figure of 1.48 million tons. “However, this was the lowest in a long time,” the bureau said.

This is at least the second major change that the government had announced since the first of the year. In July, they had announced that the state was among “three major economies” in the country. This implied a more detailed assessment was needed of the economy from a national perspective.

The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), which was responsible for the state’s weather forecasting, however, believes the situation ‘s definitely changing and forecasts “a trend towards more rainfall this year in the North-West and parts of the south of the state, particularly in June-July”.

In fact, they believe the situation will change again in the short-run, and that another “severe drought’ will be “likely” and “short-term’, which would mean rainfall is likely to increase.

“Though, it is not the same situation that we saw last year, it’s certainly possible that we will see more rainfall this year,” BOM head S.M. Santhosh said.

The BOM also said the “state is likely to see the seasonality of rainfall shift”, and that it will see more rainfall of between 500-1,000mm against a normal of 300-800mm.

He also predicted there would be less flood situation this year and rain on top of a drought situation.

There has be no major rainfall in the state since February 26. The highest rainfall was over 100mm at Mysore
