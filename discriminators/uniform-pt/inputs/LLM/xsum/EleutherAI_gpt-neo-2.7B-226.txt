In 2016 Action Man received its first update, featuring a new face, new hair and a more powerful weapon which can throw stones, bricks and anything else.

Mr Krummel has since made more updates to the toy, including new accessories and hair pieces, since working on them in his spare time as a retired police officer.

One action figure of a young Action Man, played by Michael Peake, was on display in the Leicester Museum in 2008, where he has since been replaced.

Although he has received more than 50,000 letters responding to criticism about Action Man and the delay to the latest update, Mr Krummel says he never wanted to see the dolls in the "big bright boxes" in stores again.

"They weren't meant to have 'big bright boxes', that is pure and simple rubbish, my view is Action Man was released with a purpose to make a difference. They needed to be made widely available," he said.

"Action Man was meant to be for all ages. They would have wanted action figures, they would have gone on adventures, they would have had other hobbies as well as playing football or running marathons, action figures in the 1980s and 90s were not very different but they were made to last."

Mr Willie, the designer behind the original toy, said:
