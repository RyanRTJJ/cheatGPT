 and is published with a journalist's utmost integrity. I believe this is what the public deserves, but more importantly this information should come from the journalist rather than another authority."

He went on to say that he had written to the Royal College of Nursing's CEO about his concerns about the way it had handled the newsworthiness of the reports, and that "I continue to believe that the NHS needs better care journalism in hospitals. It has no better role to play in hospitals than reporting on the problems in hospitals. Journalism that can expose care fraud."

The paper added : "On top of that, the NHS must be vigilant about being up front when reporting on serious matters like criminal activity or claims about its staff. Journalists should not be used to telling other media organisations that they are being biased at best and at worst helping corrupt or abusive relationships and that those outlets get the truth."

The article, The Truth About Dr David Cameron, received a flood of criticism online, with some describing it as "an anti-democratic smear campaign from Labour".

One Reddit user who wrote "this story is really sad. i really believe the nurses would know more about it than doctors," claimed "Doctors, nurses and doctors are all professionals who are highly trained and intelligent."

He argued that a BBC journalist could explain everything they know about the scandal through the information provided and "that is incredibly difficult for journalists, especially for something like this to come from the government."

He said: "This is also anti-democratic. First of all, David Cameron should really get into trouble over this and there is not a reason for this to be leaked. This is a direct challenge to those organisations that he has made fun of, he should be ashamed of himself."

The article ended with two pictures that claimed to show "the real deal", which he added "couldn't be made to look any better than this."

A spokesman for the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said it had been made aware of the allegations and is investigating.
