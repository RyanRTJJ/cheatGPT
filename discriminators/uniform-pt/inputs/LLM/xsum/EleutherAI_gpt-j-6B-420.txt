 top 100 students missed places over three quarters of the time

For children from poorer working families getting into top universities has become increasingly likely - but in many cases getting a place can be as much as 30% harder than for top students.

A study of more than two million applicants by the University of Oxford, London School of Economics and York University, shows the 'cream' never reaches a table. Almost 7% of applicants from the top working quintile missed out on their first choice, compared to 5% from the bottom quintile. By choosing the best students, universities will tend to over-pursue, the researchers say, and fail to admit enough of those who could improve their grades.

The findings, published in the journal PloS One, reveal how education in Britain still segregates as a class of its own. Top sixth forms make a bigger contribution to the university league table than private schools, the poorest students perform worse at university than rich kids, and "brightest and poorest" students get into top universities at a much lower proportion than "brightest and richest".

The study analysed data for 520,984 students between 2007 and 2009 at the top 100 universities in the UK, all of which received more applications than places.

Researchers calculated the "brightest and poorest" pupils missing out on university places as a proportion of those from poorer backgrounds who got into institutions like Oxford and Cambridge. They then applied this proportion to the population of applications from students from poorer families. They looked at how this group performed at each university, and how likely they were to get a place, compared to the brightest, wealthiest students.

Most of the top universities in the country accept more applications than places. An Oxford University application has a success rate of less than 1%. But if even the best of the best are falling by more than 7%, the research suggests that many of the "best of the poorest" are missing chances to go to university.

"The odds of getting into Britain's top universities [such as Oxford, Cambridge and LSE] is increasing in the past few decades but it is getting less likely for everybody," said Professor David Ozden from the
