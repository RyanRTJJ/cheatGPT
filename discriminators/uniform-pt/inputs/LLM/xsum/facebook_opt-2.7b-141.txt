 the aim is to make MIT's liberal arts college course material “available to everyone online.”

The announcement says the system “will use the edX system to offer an expanded slate of courses from some of the world’s most revered universities.”

On Saturday, Harvard President Drew Faust said her school "lends a hand to the millions of students around the world enrolled in open educational resources.”

“These open educational resources have a profound impact on public education, and they provide more opportunities for students than any classroom can match. We are delighted to continue this collaboration with others in the UT System,” she added.

MIT Chancellor Stephen E. Salazar says it “will be an exciting and exciting opportunity for MIT students and graduates, and a new source of opportunity for millions of K-12 students across the U.S.,” adding the plan will create “an unprecedented capacity to engage and educate students about the ideas they love.”

“MIT will expand upon our existing partnerships to create programs that draw from the vast trove of MIT courses, covering areas across the spectrum of the liberal arts, natural and social sciences, and business and management,” he added.

The UT system has also entered into an agreement with the University of Chicago-based eCampus Network to support a “high-impact initiative that brings eCampus Network courses to new locations across the UT system,” officials say.

At the end of the spring semester, both the Massachusetts and the U.S. education systems have introduced a range of changes to help parents and students adjust to online learning amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The Massachusetts state education commissioner earlier this week asked schools to close their classes to in-person teaching and move to remote learning following a massive rise in coronavirus infection rates.

On Friday, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos pushed “ Distance Instruction in Response to COVID-19” legislation, saying the legislation makes “clear that Distance Instruction for up to 10 percent of a school’s students must be available from day one” in the event that schools close due to coronavirus.
