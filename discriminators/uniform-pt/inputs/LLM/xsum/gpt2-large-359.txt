Al-Sobky was among a dozen people who sat behind a black screen during a discussion about sexual harassment in an English talk show last week.


The host, John Cameron, was confronted by Al-Sobky over his claim that women "don't want it, they wouldn't take it, it's a form of humiliation", according to The Sun.


Al-Sobky also responded to comments by fellow panelist Julie Baines, 31, saying: "It wasn't good conversation, but there's nothing I can do about that."


The show was broadcast from London with the participation of a group of Arab women. It received more than 700 complaints by Sunday.

"To our knowledge there was no discussion of sexual harassment or the Arab media's responsibility in covering these cases," he said.


Abidin claimed that Al-Sobky was an active participant in international media coverage, and therefore, the authorities' banning was motivated by that.


The incident caused controversy in Saudi Arabia, where media and activists are protesting against a recent video of Egyptian-Jewish comedian Ahmed Qaddour. Al-Sobky is seen as a hero to many Egyptian activists and journalists.

His remarks drew condemnation from Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who called for the cancellation of an Al-Sobky talk show set to air next week.


He also sparked outrage when his comments on sexual harassment sparked outrage in Norway's capital, Oslo, where his show was to air on Friday morning.


Meanwhile, Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende suggested that the boycott of Al-Sobky's show was not a solution and urged the authorities to take measures to prevent any
