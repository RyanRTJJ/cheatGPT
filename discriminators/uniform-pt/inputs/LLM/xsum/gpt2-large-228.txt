 no effective treatment for fungi. "It can be a very unpleasant situation," he said. "The only way that we find a cure is to stop the infection." He said one of the reasons for this was that people who had no symptoms of having fungal infections would then have to undergo painful surgical procedures to clear the infected organ.

Professor Gow said the World Health Organisation was also responsible for making no difference to the number of deaths.

He said this was partly because the organisation had not prioritised the issue.

He said there was a need for urgent research to find out the reasons for the rise.

Professor Gow said it was not clear if there were any specific diseases causing fungus disease, but it could be caused by fungi as well as bacteria, viruses and fungi.

The problem has become so widespread that in some countries fungi caused three out of every five deaths, he said.

He said fungi infection "is not a fungal disease as it's not a pathogen but it can be serious".

He said there is also a fear in some parts of the world that people have become less cautious and are becoming less aware of the potential dangers.

People can be exposed to fungi by eating food or picking them up from wood, wood smoke and other sources.

Fungal infections can take over the lungs, causing pneumonia and bronchitis. They can cause meningitis and other complications.

People can also be exposed to fungi through soil, air or drinking water.

Fungal infections are caused by fungi on living organisms called fungi, which are living organisms with a specific cell wall.

Fungal fungi grow on dead tissues to start new growth, which is how the fungi infect.

There are approximately five types of fungi and not all of these are harmful to humans.

Professor Gow said the most common cause of fungal infections were:

Micrococcidiosis - the infection of the cells of the mucous membranes
