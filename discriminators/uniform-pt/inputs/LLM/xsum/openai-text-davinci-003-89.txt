 order to consider Glossip's case. Glossip is set to be sentenced following an appeal to the Supreme Court.

Glossip was convicted of a 1997 murder of his former boss, but had claimed that he was framed. He was originally sentenced to death in 1998, but a new trial was ordered in 2004. He was sentenced to death again in 2016.

The Supreme Court's decision marks the end of a long legal battle for Glossip and his lawyers. They had argued that his initial trial and conviction was based on unreliable evidence, and his appellate lawyers had urged the justices to reconsider his death sentence in light of new evidence.

Glossip was originally set to die by lethal injection at 3 pm on Wednesday. But Governor Fallin has now postponed the execution until September 30th, allowing time for further evaluation of Glossip's request for a new trial. Although Fallin has the authority to grant clemency, it is unclear if she will take action in this case.

Glossip and his legal team have argued that new evidence indicates that his conviction was based on unreliable evidence and was racially biased. The defense team believes that Glossip's alleged accomplice, Justin Sneed, who is serving a life sentence for the crime, was the one who committed the murder. They have asked the Supreme Court to consider their appeal for a retrial or the granting of clemency.

Despite Fallin's decision to postpone Glossip's execution, his fate remains uncertain. It is possible that Fallin may commute his sentence to life in prison. This, however, is ultimately up to Fallin, who must now weigh the legal merits of Glossip's appeals with considerations of public safety and justice.
