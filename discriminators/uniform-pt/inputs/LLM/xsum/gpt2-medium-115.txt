 time of a second attack, in the town of Kargil, he held a knife to the young Indian journalist's throat and demanded to know how many times Pakistan and India had visited his country since independence.

After the assault on Khalaf, two men from the town of Bishwanath allegedly attacked a civilian on an air passenger flight, stabbing him after he had questioned the actions of Indian officials. The victim, a medical student, died, and the assailants were arrested. They were eventually convicted, sentenced to 12 years in jail and given two years' probation and ordered to pay a fine of $21,000.

But, in April 2016, the Indian Foreign Ministry called on Pakistan to step up its cooperation following a spate of attacks on journalists in India. In a statement, the ministry urged both sides to take stronger action to protect the freedom of the media, including stopping all attacks, warning against "illegal and counterproductive attacks on independent journalists".

Meanwhile, two Pakistani police officers tried to set fire to a government vehicle in the city of Lahore in October and later pleaded guilty to their role in the attack, while another, the same police officer, who had committed previous assaults, was arrested.

The government has not responded to repeated requests for comment about whether the ministry had raised the issue with the government of India and on whether it had requested the security agencies in Pakistan to increase efforts to catch those responsible for such attacks.

India was initially "haunted" by a series of attacks in 2012 - on media workers, diplomats and activists, including two journalists. Several other Indian officials, including the country's home minister, had also been targeted in terror attacks on December 2, 2012.

The New York-based New America Foundation, an advocacy lobby group, said both the security agencies and the Indian police had a responsibility to improve the security situation in parts of the country, especially with such attacks continuing.
