 strongly opposed to this plan and instead wants the hoard to remain in the town museum.

The GVHC believes that the hoard constitutes a unique opportunity to educate and engage the local population to an impressive cultural heritage and thus the best choice would be to house it in the new art gallery. They believe that by doing so, the economic, social and educational values associated with the hoard would be maximized. The GVHC suggests that the new art gallery should incorporate a dedicated area to feature the hoard, in order to draw in more tourists and promote Kirkcudbright as a major visitor attraction in the South West of Scotland.

Dumfries and Galloway Councilâ€™s main concern is that the gallery could not provide a secure and suitable environment for the hoard, whereas the current museum provides these conditions and is more easily accessible for local people. They believe that a more suitable alternative to the gallery would be to expand the current museum.

Ultimately, the decision of where the hoard should reside rests with the owner, the National Museums of Scotland. They are trying to weigh up the benefits of both options and make the best decision for the hoard and the community. Ultimately, they will take into consideration which of the two options is best suited to conserve and display the hoard, provide educational opportunities and attract visitors.
