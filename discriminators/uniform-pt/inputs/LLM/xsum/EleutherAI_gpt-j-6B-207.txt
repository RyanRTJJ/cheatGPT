 racially aggravated grievous bodily harm with intent

The five men are from Birmingham, Walsall, Wolverhampton, Nottingham and Essex who deny murder and conspiring to cause racially aggravated GBH with intent

The jury of seven women and five men has been told they must decide 'on all the evidence' if Mr Ullah and three others were attacked when they intervened in a fight

A MAN suffered 'life-changing' brain injuries and could be left with brain damage after 'hundreds' of punches and'stomping kicks' to his head in a 'horrendous' fight, a court has heard.

Ikram Ullah Khan, 28, was stabbed in the neck in the Stratford Road area of Sparkbrook on Saturday 2 July.

Five men are accused of the murder and conspiring to cause GBH with intent and three others are accused of assisting the five men to cause GBH.

The men deny all the allegations against them.

The court at Birmingham Crown Court was told that Mr Ullah was left 'on the floor' as he sat outside a chip shop on the Stratford Road at about 2am on Saturday, 2 July.

He was discovered by John Jones, who was on his way to take a bus home.

As the fight was broken up he noticed two more Asian men on the footpath in an attempt to help Mr Ullah as he lay on the ground, the court heard.

Jurors were told Mr Jones tried to 'pull apart' the two men he spotted on the ground alongside Mr Ullah but a third Asian man, wearing a tracksuit top and dark clothing, intervened and the court heard the following words were shouted: "He's a Paki, he shouldn't have been stabbed."

The court heard Mr Ullah tried to push him away, and as he made to stand up a car drove past. The prosecution say the driver of this car heard the 'racial overtones' in the words Mr Ullah tried to shout, adding that: 'He went for them,' the court heard Mr Jones say.
