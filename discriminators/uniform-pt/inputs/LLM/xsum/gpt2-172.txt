Bryan Crooks picked up four wickets and was sent off for taking one run out on 10 August after he was struck by Sharpe's bowler, Shaun Maloney, who had had a successful approach.

After an extended discussion on wicketkeeping the pair agreed that a new order should be held at Newham rather than the Old Firm - a decision which was upheld by the judges who ruled he was not allowed to face Sharpe.

Williams was initially suspended after a second wicket on 14 August after Sharpe was in the face of a double wicket.

Tasman's try after his first wicket of the season saw Williams caught out on wicket by Travon Dansom.

Clarke, who was left with 3-6 for the second wicket, got into trouble but won off.

On a four-on-three boundary, Clarke was caught out for an attempt where he missed to his wicket but he had hit Sharpe's fifth ball

Clarke and Williams started playing second wicket at the very boundary where the second wicket on the inside right-hand side came short in the space of five overs. Sharpe then used his spin to reach on Sharpe's second.

Clarke (22) was caught out for an attempted cross (24), but he picked up 4-5 on the second wicket before being sent off for being caught out for being caught out for swinging between the wicket and the wicket. Clarke was seen running up to Sharpe at the boundary after his third out but ran down in fear for his life and was left with only 7.

Sharpe was assessed after the third out but was assessed for not meeting Sharpe's limit for wickets so he was not seen on the surface.
