 group is £4.5bn.

It said it was working on alternative ways to generate new revenue as part of its plan to expand into new markets including Russia and Brazil. It said it was exploring the possibilities of an IPO, which would enable it to raise a new capital of £5bn before the end of 2016.

The news is one of a number of moves in the industry that has emerged in recent weeks. Amazon.com and Starbucks have moved into brick-and-mortar stores, while online bookseller Barnes & Noble has acquired e-commerce firm Ingram Micro. And technology firm Apple has hired Apple's former vice president of retail operations.

On Apple's retail plans, Apple declined to comment on Thursday's announcement.

The company said it would release more information on Apple Inc's plans at an event in San Francisco on Monday.

It said: "In late June 2015, the company unveiled new iPhones and iPads, and then launched a new software update that made all of these products even better. These updates have allowed us to keep cutting-edge technology in every stage of its lifecycle, from construction to sale, and has enabled us to deliver new features and services that will not only surprise our consumers, but delight them.

"More broadly, the company has continued to transform itself, and has become stronger and more innovative. We believe the greatest value is to continue to surprise our customers with innovations that change the way they think about their devices, their lifestyles, and the way they communicate."

Apple said that it "continues to innovate on key product and design fronts and will reveal further details in the most meaningful way possible".

It added: "We are proud that our products continue to delight our customers, and our employees, and we thank them and their families for their commitment to our company.

"We continue to grow, create jobs and put people back to work."
