 to level his century with Ricky Ponting (127 on the third day to Ian Bell's 161).

The visitors dominated for the first twenty-seven overs, and it looked to be another one-day series when things went downhill for Worcestershire - as they did in South Africa. His partner in crime, Joe Clarke, played a major role, giving Worcestershire a good edge on bowlers but not necessarily a big one, and the score of 6-41 in ten overs was his maiden in three years.

At the start of day three, Worcestershire, backed up by Clarke, made 4-16 and the series ended within three hours 15 minutes instead of five!

Worcestershire, who was playing in his fifth T20IC in his career, took the loss that night and his run of nine straight T20 ODIs - and the first two at the MCG in the five years he has played - continued with a draw against the slow-start Victoria Royals.

While Worcestershire is the only one with a T20I in four of his six ODIs this season, David Warner was bowled by Mark Soshie to give South African side Zimbabwe the first ODI win at Brisbane in three years as the tourists rolled to 12-7 and 8-15, their best ODI overall score.

Warner was named captain, his maiden as captain, after three successful ODI years - 2008-12 and 2013-14 - helped lead Zimbabwe to one of their most successful runs in history at the time.

South Africa, on the other hand, have only finished one out of four ODIs they played this year - four with three losses - in seven years. This season was their fifth of eight in the one-day format - the last time their record in that area was outside five wins was in 2011 when they were the fourth best side.

A draw with New Zealand - and with the hosts outscoring them 9-14 to 0-30 - and an 11-hit defeat to Australia at the MCG - both went hand in hand,
