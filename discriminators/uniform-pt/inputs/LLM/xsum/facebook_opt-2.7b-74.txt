 back as the drivers went for "tactical moves" in the long-run segments.

With the weather forecast for Sunday much more like the first part of Wednesday's practice session, drivers decided to run "only some of our normal set-ups" and to "try and make some overtaking moves", Hamilton having the best time of 1min 27.082secs.

That put him more than a second clear of Bottas in the sister Mercedes, as he tried out various set-ups having run long stints at the start of the session.

"In qualifying I had to go on the defensive, because it's not easy to overtake," said Hamilton, who had previously said he planned to "keep the cool head" and just make the most of his good start from pole position to fight back to the front.

"I had a strategy with the long stints in the beginning, but we obviously ended up with a one stop for my race, so we had to change our strategy and take some risks at the end of the straight when there was low speed."

Pirelli is predicting track temperatures of 24C at the end of the straight, not much warmer than at Wednesday's morning session.

However, they also said there was "potential for higher temperatures in the final sector" of the Austrian layout, the long, uphill section which leads into the second and final chicane that passes through the Red Bull Ring.

Pirelli said there were "definitely options" for the tyres on offer, allowing drivers with no more than one stop to make an effort to be competitive despite the low temperatures.

While they said they have tested a wide range of tyre compounds for both Pirelli's ultra-soft and super-soft, they did not rule out the possibility of more radical changes.
