5m in Scotland last year despite the country’s continuing economic problems, the Statistics Authority said.

That figure included 2.2m domestic visitors, 2.5m of whom were in the most recent figures, up from 2.3m just the previous year – despite only 3.5m Scots not having the funds to go elsewhere, the stats authority said. (The figures exclude students from mainland European countries.)

By contrast, the figures put overall visitor numbers at more than £15bn in total for the same period last year, and overseas visitor spending at nearly £1.5bn.

The Scottish Government hopes the figures will help to highlight the importance of tourism, which has grown by a third to nearly £30bn a year and accounts for as much as 9% of Scotland’s gross domestic product.

A spokesman said: “Scotland is a growing destination and the latest figures reveal our success in this area.

“They also reinforce the importance of the economic benefits that tourism brings. In 2015, our international visitor numbers reached record levels – higher than the number of international tourists to the UK.”

A new Scottish Government strategy states the Scottish Government’s priority goal is to increase international tourism to a £50bn industry by 2020.

The ODA, however, is also concerned by continued weak economic growth in Scotland, with GDP growing at just 1.8%.

The strategy says the Scottish Government now expects an economy similar to those of the best performing nations across the advanced world, but it adds: “It is of course vital that growth is kept at a sustainable level.”

According to the ODA, Scottish tourists pay up to 10% more than visitors from London for goods and services and 15% more in the case of accommodation.

The agency also warned economic growth has reached levels seen in only one other OECD country: Finland, which grew 6.5% last year and is now experiencing unemployment rates 1.8% lower than Scotland’s.

According to the ODA, a quarter of all tourists now say Scottish places are important to them, up from 25% in 2005.
