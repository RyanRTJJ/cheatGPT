Mr Bailey’s legal team last night made an emergency application for a hearing on the matter, alleging that Judge Moran was “wrong in law” in granting the Garda request to stay the case.

Judge Moran has no date set to rule on the application, but he will hear the case when the court re-convenes this Friday, when the case will be dealt with as usual.
