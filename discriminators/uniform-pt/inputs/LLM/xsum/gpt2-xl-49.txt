Luis Suarez has called Lionel Messi one of his closest friends and he hopes the Barcelona forward can help his country reach the 2016 Olympics.

The two have a great relationship, so it comes as no surprise that Messi, who had been named as the tournament's top goalscorer by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and was named its player of the year, was chosen for the South American squad.

Messi's team-mate Javier Mascherano believes the forward's role is huge in Brazil.

"Messi will bring something to the team to be honest," he told El Pais. "If he can help a team-mate achieve something it makes it easier for him as a man, because he knows how many sacrifices you have to make in the game.

"Messi brings to the team quality with his skill."
