 of the 1990 Premiership champions Portsmouth while working in a hotel room in London.

But he added he had been "not really aware or aware that I'd missed the game", adding: "I am aware that I'm not aware of the injuries, but I was not in a condition where I would have missed so much time playing against Portsmouth. It's a shame that my team missed what was going on and not being aware of it. The club really should have given me the best possible head-up." He ended the conversation after his team-mates called for an apology. When the club tweeted how disappointing the loss of an outstanding player would be, The Sun reported it was because of his role in the 1970s, but later added: "They knew he played for Portsmouth but were not clear about why he was not represented by the English Football Association. I've received a lot of messages from fans in England, with fans from Northern Ireland and elsewhere."

Portsmouth's record matchless campaign

Portsmouth manager Jack Heens said: "After the loss of Michael O'Reilly in 2005, Chris was clearly not as good to Newcastle who gave a great performance while he was away. Now Chris is not looking back, his performances and experience have played a big part for the club but the loss of his man in the 1990s was simply horrendous."

Former Newcastle midfielder Mike Gilt said: "The best team in the club, so far as we know, played well when he got left off with injury to his knee. We thought that he'd start making things right but, once again, he was a player we have to thank for coming through the door.

"It was his return that really got the game going. He was a player who scored on our line, made the most of it, and he had his best game of his career."

He added: "The way Manchester United have performed at home has been the best they have attempted to come across at present."
