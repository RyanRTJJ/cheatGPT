 recommended levels of sugar and saturated fat in their food, with 30% of people said to be "doing well" and the rest "lacking in confidence".

Professor Michael Neumark, co-director of the division of preventive medicine at the University of Oxford, says sugar consumption is "very much linked to chronic disease".

"We've all heard of it being the cause of heart disease, stroke, type-1 diabetes and obesity, and we think we know very little about it," he says.

"It could be the single most important factor causing long-term health problems, and because we don't know much about it there's enormous pressure to reduce it and the idea of an intervention seems very reasonable."

A third of Americans believe it's fine to eat a large amount of sugar to gain weight. Just 20% of them said they "were doing perfectly well" with their sugar intake and the rest said it was too much.

"The evidence is really clear, people who eat a lot of sugar will tend to have very high levels of fat in their blood rather than sugar, and that will be a significant problem in those of us who are trying to lose weight," says Prof Neumark.

Even before the study was carried out, the British Dietetic Association, also representing doctors in the UK, said it wanted people to "discover" sugar - not to go hungry.

So what can people do to limit their intake?

Avoid sweet items such as cakes and pies, or more likely soft drinks

Drink less water, fruit juice and sugary cereals because it can be harder to digest they

Cut down on sugar substitutes such as fruit powders and confectioner's sugar, and limit consumption of processed foods

Dress in clothing and accessories that help you shed excess weight, such as shirts and jeans if your waist is higher than 25cm; avoid oversized t-shirts and caps

Try to eat meals where you eat and drink together, and avoid eating at restaurants if you're feeling full
