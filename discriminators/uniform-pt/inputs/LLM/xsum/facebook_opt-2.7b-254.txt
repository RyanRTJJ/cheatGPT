, who was with her, noticed she suffered a'severe injury' in the toilet cubicle and contacted the police believing her daughter had been attacked in the toilet.
She was taken to hospital where she remained for treatment for several days.
The incident sparked fears of a rise in assaults on teenage girls in North Devon at the time.
At the time, police said: "A teenage girl sustained a serious facial injury inside a McDonald's toilet cubicle following an unknown incident. She remains in hospital. Detectives are investigating. It is believed two girls left the super-strong glue on the toilet seat."
