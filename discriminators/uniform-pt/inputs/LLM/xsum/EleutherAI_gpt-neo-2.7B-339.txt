 summoned Asghar to appear before a magistrate for allegedly trying to set fire to a prison.

Asghar's mother, Khusro Rizvi, filed a legal complaint that would go some way to resolving the dispute, while demanding an apology to Asghar and his family, saying he was "not only a Pakistani but a human, too."

Haque, a former head of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), said Asghar had been a "regular prisoner" who had not been involved in any disturbances.
