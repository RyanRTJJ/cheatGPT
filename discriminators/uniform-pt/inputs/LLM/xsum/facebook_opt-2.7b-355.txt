 a "significant risk" of children being harmed in the way that the schools where they were sent to were "failed to adequately protect them".

Wilshaw, the education inspection body, said he had decided to call for an end to the practice of sending vulnerable children to a church.

This is what he said earlier in his report: "We conclude that there has been an unacceptable failure in the protection of children, with girls and boys suffering unacceptable levels of harm in two large, well-known and established schools."

He said it was wrong to blame the problem only on the schools' leaders and "the way it is presented has given the impression that there were no safeguards or oversight systems in place".

So what did Ofsted actually find?

Wilshaw found two cases of incidents of serious harm that had been identified as being a risk to children before the children arrived at the schools.

"These cases were considered to be a significant risk to children, and the children were excluded from the relevant schools before they could join existing schools."

But he also found other children had been exposed to the risk, "and no proper steps were taken to protect them", he said.

He went on to say that his conclusions were based on an incomplete analysis of the data, but "if this was done in other instances, it is highly likely that the findings would have been very similar".

"It is therefore clear that where children were being transferred to schools, the data collection system failed."

How does it work?

The Ofsted process involves a school sending Ofsted one of five kinds of information:

Evidence on any previous safeguarding risks that the school has faced,

A list of information given to pupils and parents when they arrive,

Information that the school has received about the new school, and

Information about the school's previous experiences of safeguarding issues.

Schools are required to have the relevant information ready within a week of receiving it.

Where a school is deemed not to have taken the necessary steps to safeguard a child it could be sent back to Ofsted for its second round of inspections. And if it is
