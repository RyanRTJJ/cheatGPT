 Commissioner Mark Murdoch said such a case could arise in other police scandals, but the laws relating to them should be better.

"We certainly don't want to use the police to do what is not police or a lawful police activity," he said.

But Mr Murdoch warned officers would be investigated for "wrongdoing if they behave unlawfully" and that "the potential to be subjected to criminal proceedings is always there".

The ABC understands that police were warned the raids were illegal in September, when they first investigated Mr Blair's private office and the residence of former cabinet minister Alastair Campbell at No. 10.

One senior officer even drafted a report for senior counsel to explain the issues involved. Police told the officer the plans would be reviewed on their next major investigation into security of ministerial offices.

But the officer believes the advice has not been acted on and is now understood to be a subject of legal action.

Mr Murdoch admitted the situation could not be repeated as there would now be "clear rules of law" about getting warrantless search powers. It meant officers would be "more careful if we needed to use them in future", he told the inquiry.

Mr Murdoch said that even if police had done all the legal requirements, "it would still be wrong".

In 2007, Police Minister John Dyson became the third minister to resign after it was revealed that police illegally accessed the details of a journalist and his sources. The revelations sparked a furious backlash over the state's use of police powers.

He also admitted that the actions of police were "completely unacceptable" and "the public don't trust police any more."

"I'm not going to say we should be giving police the same powers, which is why I haven't indicated the kind of review of that legislation that I think it needs," he told the inquiry.

He told the committee there had been no public protest against allowing police to search phone taps or search premises.

But Mr Murdoch admitted that
