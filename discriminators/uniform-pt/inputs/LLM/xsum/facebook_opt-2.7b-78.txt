 year over the killing and initially bailed. After being released on bail, he was recalled to jail while inquiries continued and he has subsequently been charged with murder.

The IRA was behind at least 12 executions or attempted executions in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, a report by a parliamentary committee last year claimed. The IRA’s “repressive and violent approach” was aimed at demoralising the local population, it said.

In one assassination attempt over a two-year period in 1967-1968, 10 people were abducted in Enniskillen before being killed by a car bomb. Another 10 were abducted in Belfast before being killed in a bomb blast and their bodies hidden in a rubbish tip.

The IRA’s “repressive and violent approach” was aimed at demoralising the local population, the committee said.

The report also said the killing of a Catholic by the UDA in Belfast in 1972 marked a tipping point that led IRA members to become more brutal, as they felt “there was no other option”.

The committee said its inquiries had uncovered “extremely disturbing testimony of some former IRA members” who agreed that their actions of the 1970s “had crossed an unacceptable line and they were prepared to have their day in court, as they were now in their sixties.”

Two former IRA members who agreed to testify on the record to the committee said they saw death squads murdering members of two rival families. “I have worked in these areas and seen the murder of innocent people, mainly Catholic,” one former IRA member told the committee. “We all wanted to go straight – our families did not want to hear about our actions. So we spoke about it and kept it out of the street.”

A Sinn Féin spokesman said that if the government “sought to pass judgment on its own record, it should do so in the context of the peace process”.

A representative for Mr Adams said: “This is absolutely grotesque. Gerry Adams has never broken the law. We do not comment on speculation.”
