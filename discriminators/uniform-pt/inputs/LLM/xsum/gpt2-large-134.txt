 city of Homs. A doctor at a hospital in the town on Wednesday admitted that there had been a sharp reduction in the number of victims. "Our hospitals used to receive 300 or 400 casualties per day but now their number has dropped to 40 to 50," Dr Nizar al-Zeyr said.

The UN security council will hold an emergency meeting later on Wednesday to discuss the worsening situation in Homs.

On Tuesday, the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said fighting in Homs was a war crime and urged international concern if it continued. Johnson, who was visiting Israel at the time, said he hoped the UN would use its powers of the council to ensure action followed.

US air strikes in Syria and Iraq have become an annual issue in the US presidential election. Despite mounting evidence of civilian deaths in recent months, Republican candidate Donald Trump has accused Clinton of hypocrisy, saying her failure to comment on the situation on Syria was "extremely foolish".

On Friday, the White House announced that the US military had conducted 16 air strikes throughout Syria since the start of the year, striking several locations.

The strike on the hospital in Jarboula was the only confirmed air strike within Syria so far this year.


A Syrian news website on Wednesday reported that the Syrian military had lost control of the area north-west of Homs to rebels after rebels shot down a fighter jet and destroyed five tanks. It added that fighters had also attacked an area further north.

The UK foreign secretary, William Hague, said the US action demonstrated Washington's determination to prevent the world from becoming a world without safe havens for extremists.

A group of around 20 members of the Syrian government-backed Supreme Military Council, led by the general Abdul Karim Idris, took part in the celebrations in Jarboula, according to the group's social media
