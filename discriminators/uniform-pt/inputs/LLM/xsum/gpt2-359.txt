"It came out after years of criticism as a show that has lost respect for the Egyptian people," his wife, Ezza al-Sobky, told the BBC.

Reuters reported Saturday that she and the crew of "The Americans" had asked their network to remove the show from its Egyptian Facebook pages, but they were reportedly not able to get that done.

Sobky, a former aide to Morsi, said in a television interview that the show, which he did not name, was "all about politics" and was about "fighting and fighting for the freedom of Egypt".

He also described it as "political propaganda".

AFP quoted the president's sister, Abhisit al-Sobky, saying that she felt she was "absolutely not" allowed on the show because her sister expressed "unacceptable feelings" about it.

Sobky says he does not condone the comments, which were published on his Facebook page on Saturday. He said he was "not a Muslim" and said his remarks were not "re-elected speech".

In response to the comments, Morsi addressed the audience in a televised address. According to the Egyptian press, a special police battalion was seen gathering security at the square, but did not arrive.

On Twitter, Morsi used a Twitter account to urge unity between Muslims.

"There is only one way to change Egypt: unity, which means unity. In Islam, equality, justice, peace and justice. Equality is an art. Equality is an action," he said on Twitter.
