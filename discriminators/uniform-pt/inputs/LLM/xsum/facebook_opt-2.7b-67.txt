 autumn.

Rega also sold his controlling stake in the company last year.

“We can confirm it is looking into the matter,” a spokesperson for the company told the Guardian.

Rega’s spokesman told the BBC on Monday: “This has just popped up for the first time. I don’t even know how it happened.” The spokesman would not confirm whether he was Rega. He said he had been with Rega “for a day or two” before his exit.

Rega’s record label, Rega, began as a record shop in London in 1984 and has grown into a multinational corporation with more than 500 staff worldwide.

Formula 1 world champion Jenson Button and rega founder George Martin signed up the Rocking Horse on to its roster of artists, and the record label also counts artists like Madonna and Lady Gaga as its clients.

Rega also has operations in Germany, France, Italy, Denmark, Estonia and Latvia.

Formula 1 and the FIA are known to investigate allegations against its members. The most prominent case was last year when Martin Brundle, who served as the BBC’s television commentator for the sport, accused Bernie Ecclestone, the sport’s former chief executive, of paying bribes to the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, in an attempt to land him the role of Formula 1 chair.

Ecclestone denied the charges and there was no evidence of bribery.

Last year Ecclestone also denied allegations that a company called Wokingham Capital – named after the UK town of the same name – had received illegal benefits in return for a £5m donation to McLaren.

The case was not pursued by the FIA.

A Formula 1 spokesperson said: “We are not commenting.”
