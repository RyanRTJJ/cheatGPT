 also suffered.

The group's chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, said the survey also showed Muslims were less welcome across the board, with a decline in many towns of tolerance and respect among some people towards their neighbours and the police.

Ms Hilsenrath said: “A more open, accepting and tolerant society is good for businesses and for the economy, and for the health of our democracy. But this report also shows we still have a long way to go to make everyone equal and respected in our society.”

The commission’s annual report, based on a survey of 8,000 people in every local authority in England, Wales and Scotland, will reinforce ministers’ ambition to become a “diverse and tolerant nation that provides equal rights to all” by the end of the decade.

The report found that in 2010, just 19 per cent of respondents felt they could be a “tolerant” in their own working environment, compared to 66 per cent in 2005.

The biggest decline in tolerance was by gay people (down from 79 per cent in 2005 to 59 per cent in 2010), followed by Muslim people (down from 68 per cent to 54 per cent) and the Jewish community (down from 57 per cent to 46 per cent).

Meanwhile, there was a similar proportion of positive feeling for the police as there had been in 2005 in every local authority except one – in Redcar and Cleveland. In that town, the number of people describing local officers as “often courteous and respectful” fell from 43 per cent in 2005 to 31 per cent in 2010.

The findings are published ahead of a major speech by Prime Minister David Cameron to the Commonwealth leaders’ summit in Glasgow next week.

Mr Cameron, who will announce plans to overhaul Britain’s equalities laws, has said equal rights were “the foundation stones of our democracy”. The Government has vowed to introduce “equality impact assessments” on all
