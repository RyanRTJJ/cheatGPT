When it came to that fateful referendum day, I was one of the 'Remainers' - I supported Leave but decided to cast my vote for Remain as a way of changing the narrative of the campaign after the polls closed that morning.

Since then, I have been very clear about what I've come to see as one of the greatest mistakes of my life.

I don't believe that my decision had a negative impact on the outcome of the referendum. I do believe that millions of people did feel the effects of the vote which resulted in the United Kingdom's loss of sovereignty, a significant economic slowdown and an uncertain future for a country that was once a great player in British life.

"No" voters came into the referendum very late, perhaps too late for many to participate. In addition, Brexit is a political and social issue that is not widely shared by those who do not support the 'Remainers' - meaning some 'Remainers' will not receive as much support as had they voted 'No'.

It took a very long time for me to discover that I was living a lie. I had been told that my vote would bring increased security and prosperity to myself and my friends. It did the opposite. I have lived with this knowledge for over ten years now.

In the years that followed, the lie intensified. The reality of what I did not understand started to form a new layer which finally started to unravel all of the lies and misconceptions that I had been fed.

Both camps, as we know, were largely ineffective - the Northern Irish electorate, for example,
