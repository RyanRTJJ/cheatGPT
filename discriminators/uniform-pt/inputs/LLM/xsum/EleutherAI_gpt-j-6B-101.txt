 just four runs and ended on 146-7.

It was a similar story at The Oval with Mark Pettini's century the highlight of Worcestershire's batting but his was the sole score of substance among a batting line-up that included 16 players hitting the 30 mark, 14 made over 30 and 15 over 20.

The Worcestershire openers passed 50 by the time the seventh wicket fell, but an ill-timed run-out cost three of them while Matt Spriegel fell for a top-edged 52 in his first over. Tom Smith played a calm hand in his eight over with two boundaries and the excellent Will Beer produced an all-round performance with some nice fending off the legs before going for 27 at the other end.

Pettini and Tim Curtis shared a second wicket partnership of 61 and after the excellent Spriegel (3 for 27) went for a patient 34 before playing on, it was Worcestershire's batting who had the last laugh. A top-edged pull off Beer's gloves gave the visitors their fourth wicket before James Martin found the edge off James Bracey for two, the next two players then fell to the same pair in consecutive balls to concede 49.

Beer went on to make 78, including eight boundaries, and Martin then joined a 41st-minute stand which had not been bettered in over 15 years with Andrew Shaw (27), and finally ended with a fine catch off a Dermot McInerney leg-side throw from mid-wicket.

A last-wicket stand of 32 between Craig White and David Wainwright was not enough as Worcestershire were finally reduced to eight overs remaining. White was the aggressor while Wainwright's slower left-arm bowler, Ben Smith, was kept to just one ball more than 45 overs in a game that lasted just two sessions and three balls.

The other day was the first of three in this weekend's Championship games featuring a team which is unbeaten through six games after winning only two Championship games last year.

Kandia Oval will be the first of
