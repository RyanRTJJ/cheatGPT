 at the university he said students should not be included in the immigration target system for fear of alienating them. "The last thing we should want to do is alienate students of all origins. We need international students. They help the economy and provide expertise. They help maintain our universities."

Students voted heavily in favour of the Union, as well as pro-EU groups, by 78.8% to 21.2%. The referendum comes after a tumultuous year for students in the UK's higher education sector. In January 2016, more than 10,000 students protested across the country on the eve of the referendum on membership of the European Union. The campaign to keep the UK in the EU was supported by students as a way to protect the institution they study and the students, staff and academics who work there.

In 2016, as a result of a drop in the number of international students, the number of students of all backgrounds in higher education in the UK dropped by the most for a decade.

Hamilton said there was a need for clarity. "The UK will be a much stronger democracy, more open and united, if universities continue to be free from external, direct or indirect attempts to influence the teaching, the research they carry out and their student organisations. They need to work with the government and the UK as a whole and help the UK succeed internationally."

Professor Sir Ian Boyd, president of the British Academy, who attended yesterday's meeting, said many would have voted for the union because of the need to protect against the loss of EU funding. The BAI said the government should maintain and increase the Research Councils England funding available to universities in the event of a Brexit.

Boyd said the vote for the union was a good sign for the future of higher education in the UK. "The students were saying clearly they were not prepared to stand on the sidelines and allow universities to suffer."

It comes after a similar vote
