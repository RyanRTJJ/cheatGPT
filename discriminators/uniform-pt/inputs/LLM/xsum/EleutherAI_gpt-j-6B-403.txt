 22 runs off 16 balls as the hosts reached their target without further loss. Mitchell Santner (2-42) was on target for the South Africa while Dale Steyn (0-26) did well to bowl New Zealand's top four cheaply.

At stumps New Zealand had built a commanding total of 216 for only three wickets in hand, but it is early days. New Zealand's chase could be tough because Australia have struggled to get past the 50 mark against South Africa. And they have just two new balls to look for wickets.

The New Zealand team will take on Dale Steyn's team in the series opener at the Wanderers tomorrow (April 5).

New Zealand are not new to playing spin in ODIs. Kane Williamson and Williamson's older brother, James had a great relationship as pacers for New Zealand, while Corey Anderson has enjoyed success against spin in T20 cricket. Mitchell Santner will also be bowling as the pace weapon.

Dale Steyn will be looking to make his mark as South Africa take the field against New Zealand.

Australia might have a strong line-up on paper but the South African bowlers have been able to turn it around in recent times.

In the last three years, South Africa has won seven out of 12 ODIs against Australia, while in T20Is, they have won 13 out of 20 matches.

South Africa will be hoping to continue in the same trend on Saturday, before they turn their attention to India.

The Australian team has a host of world-class players, including Steve Smith (who is playing his first World Cup and leading his team in every ODI), who has averaged 47.66 runs across all ODIs since March 2017 and who has scored nine half-centuries and hit one double-century.

Other big-name players in the squad are David Warner, David Warner (again), Shaun Marsh, Steve Smith, Nathan Lyon, Chris Woakes, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis.

India will hope Rohit Sharma can guide a young bunch as captain to victory in the series opener. India won the last time they faced the Kiwis
