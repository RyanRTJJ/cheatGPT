 Labour councillors.

Meanwhile, Ukip has had only minimal advances in Essex and Hertfordshire councils, according to provisional figures.

Party leader Paul Nuttall said: "We started 2016 with zero councillors at the last election and by the end of the year we will be over three hundred councillors for the year.

"When the Labour Party had the wind behind its sails they ended 2014 as the main opposition in local government.

"We know what kind of chaos that has led to – under Theresa May they have lost a third of their councillors in local government.

"Labour should listen to our message and start taking notice of local government.

"Our message is: no more empty promises, time for action. Labour is on its knees and they should get up again."

In 2015, Labour lost more than 300 seats in council elections.

Of those seats, about 60 went to UKIP.

But in 2016, Ukip has only gained 15 seats, although the party is hoping to finish the year significantly ahead of that in June.

Paul Bowden, the leader of Essex Council, said: "Labour has had its fair share of bad weeks, but in our experience, Essex residents vote as they see the need.

"The Essex branch of the Labour Party has more activists locally than the Tories, which shows where their voters' real priorities lie.

"Labour is in the best shape we have seen it in years."

A spokesman for the BTP said: "While the Tories have enjoyed good results in the local elections, it's not at all clear that they are in a position to make political advances over the remainder of the year."

Brent Council's interim leader said Ukip had made some gains, but that the party lost more than expected in the local elections.

Coun Tony Ball said: “I don’t think that what’s happening in local government will resonate with people outside of the area, because they will look at it, and they will say it’s the local authority and therefore you need to get on with it.”
