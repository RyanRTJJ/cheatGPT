 behind the performance of some of its rivals, leading the Government to call it a "national scandal".

But in a letter sent to GPs last Tuesday, the party accused the health authorities of using data from QEUH to justify a major overhaul of the NHS, saying it is "deeply concerned that there are no proper controls over the collection and use of such data".

"The Health and Social Care Information Centre in charge of collecting such information has no formal authority and is operated without any ethical standards," the letter said.

Last night, the party called on the Tories to immediately review data collection practices at the health service. It added: "As it is clear to us that such data is being misused and used in a way that is not transparent, it is right that the data is reviewed as an urgent priority."

Labour claimed that when the Government released figures on A&E waiting times in mid-2011, this was based on data from NHS Improvement, the organisation set up by Lansley to improve A&E performance.

But the NHS Improvement data showed A&E waits were already starting to fall at QEUH for a number of major events, including when a patient was admitted and discharged. In other circumstances, however, a significant gap remained.

Labour was given access to the data last week and published an analysis from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine of the NHS A&E performance for the period covering April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012.

The council's report said: "Despite an overall improvement in A&E performance over both 2012/13 and 2011/12, A&E waiting times continued to improve at only limited sites.

"For example, at the other four sites where 2012/13 performance performance was poor there were still significant waiting times for inpatient admissions or discharge during the whole of the year, including at both weekend and weekend mornings."

But the findings were disputed by GPs, who pointed to the council finding that although A&E waited time performance over the same time period was improved across the board, many major events remained "above par" at other sites, including weekends and
