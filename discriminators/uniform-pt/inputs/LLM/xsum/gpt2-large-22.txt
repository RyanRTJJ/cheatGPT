The air travel association The Air Passenger Organization and its clients — including major airlines including British Airways and EasyJet — have written to the government urging it to address the problem.

According to The Independent, this is the second major disruption in days. On Monday, it was "suddenly" announced that the Olympic Stadium's roof collapsed after the roof fell in and landed on a nearby subway station in London. In both cases, the buildings involved were not yet officially designated as World Heritage sites. But at least one of these events does have major impact on the entire airline industry; this is an important issue in the aviation industry at large because of the potential consequences in terms of flight paths across the country.

The closures are an all-too common occurrence during winter storms like this one. This winter, a number of flights had to be canceled because of high winds after "high" winds forced some flights out of Heathrow and at Gatwick. This came on the heels of a number of flights being stranded at Heathrow. And in November, two flights were grounded at London City Airport because of strong winds.

The airlines have offered passengers on flights to continue their journey, but no refunds for early departures. Many passengers have gone to Twitter and other social media to complain about the cancellations.

"I flew out today and got put on hold. Didn't know they had cancelled all flights, which are normally on time!" tweeted @Doty_Brit. "[F]orth of 7 flights (all 3 cities) have been cancelled after high winds
