allana and James Milner all scored in a thrilling game as Liverpool were held to a goal-by-goal draw.

Both groups are on the same level as a World Cup, and the Scots will look to replicate that in the play-offs, as they did in 2008 - where they reached the play-offs on a tie-break.

Group F: Bosnia-Herzegovina (c), Netherlands (h), Croatia (a): Two old foes have been drawn together by the same side, and are yet to meet in international football. The Dutch will be looking to get back into the big European top flight for the first time since 2010; just their second ever European Championship.

Croatia, meanwhile, will be aiming to end a seven-year drought for a third straight European Championship: only the 2009 holders have never claimed the title.

Serbia have been through a similar qualifying group in 2004 before winning a spot back then: although they won only one of the four matches, they reached the play-offs by playing a second group of five against four teams who did not qualify from Europe (the Czech Republic, Ukraine, Norway and Albania) that year.

England had beaten the Dutch at Wembley with a 2-0 win in 2009, but will look to make amends against Bosnia-Herzegovina, who look to be on the up already. They've won the last two Euro 2008 tournaments as well.

Group G: Nigeria (c), Cameroon (a), Republic of Ireland (m): The only group of players from Nigeria is from the country's only Super League, where Cameroon's players will be familiar with a different set-up. Nigeria were in Group G a year ago in a play-off against the Republic of Ireland, losing 1-0.

Republic of Ireland are in their first European Championship with coach Giovanni Trapattoni. He has been with the country since they won the World Cup in 1990, and has brought many of his own players to Spain. His men will be hoping that their experience in this competition
