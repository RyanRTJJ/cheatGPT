young, enthusiastic coach," said Strachan.

McDavidson had been assistant manager of League of Ireland side St Patrick's Athletic, and had been linked with the post of Motherwell boss before Jim White was appointed.

He said: "I'm looking forward to working with Gordon and Mark. I've been discussing it for the past couple of weeks and I'm delighted it's all now sorted out."

McDavidson, who made one senior Scotland appearance in a B international against Canada in 1998, has been player-coach at Thornton Hibs, Danish club Vejle Boldklub and St Patrick's Athletic in Dublin.

He said: "I brought a lot of success to St Patrick's Athletic and I'm hopeful I can do the same at Dundee United."

McDavidson, who has been coaching with the Scottish Football Association at schoolboy and under-21 level, moved on from St Patrick's Athletic for personal reasons.

He said: "I'd been with them for two and a half years and I wanted a new challenge, a change of environment and a change of scenery.

I know there's great potential at Dundee United and the size of the club and its fan base really excited me."

Roddy MacLennan, the Tannadice club's chairman, said: "We are delighted to have secured his services and feel he will be a valuable addition to the team."
