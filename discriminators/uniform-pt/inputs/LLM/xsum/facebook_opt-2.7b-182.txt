-winning scrum-half Andy Goode has branded the decision to stage the 15-a side event as a 'financial shambles'. But RFU boss Ian Ritchie said: 'We've got to concentrate on the women's game at the moment. We've got a new sponsor for the women's game and we've got new support.

Everyone makes a lot of money out of men's rugby but it is a complete disaster when you've got a World Cup coming up. 'The players and nations deserve so much better than what we're getting.'
