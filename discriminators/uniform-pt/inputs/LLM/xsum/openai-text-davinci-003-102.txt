dge froze payment by Argentina of services owed to the U.S. government and its agencies, including the Department of Defense, the Pentagon and the United Nations until Argentina pays the funds. The ruling is the latest step in a 12-year-old legal battle between the hedge funds and Argentina over bonds issued in the wake of Argentina’s 2001 economic crash.

The hold court order by US District Judge Thomas Griesa came in response to the hedge-funds' complaint that Argentina is failing to pay them and other bondholders, who had accepted significantly lower compensation on their debt.

The order bars Argentina from making payments to any other creditor until it pays the funds what they said they're owed — a total of $1.3 billion, plus interest. The ruling could potentially have serious repercussions for Argentina’s economy, as the US government is a major creditor of the country, providing it with financial and military aid.

The decision to freeze funds for the US sets a potential precedent for other creditors. The court ruling is a blow to Argentina’s efforts to renew its credit and raise funds, and could lead to further financial turmoil in the country.

The ruling comes as Argentina struggles to deal with yet another financial crisis. The country has been locked in a long-standing dispute with the vulture funds, and is facing default for the third time in its history.

Argentina also faces sanctions from the U.S. government over its lack of payments to creditors. Argentina's government has argued that these sanctions are unfair and have had a crippling effect on its economy.

The decision by the court to freeze Argentina's payments to US debt holders could make the financial legacy of the country even more difficult to overcome.
