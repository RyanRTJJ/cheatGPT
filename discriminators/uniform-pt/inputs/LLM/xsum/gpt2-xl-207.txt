 grievous bodily harm.

On 23 July Mohammed Ismail, 29, was stabbed in the arm in a similar attack in the same area of Sparkbrook. Abdul Aziz Aamer, 31, was stabbed for the second time in the same area, in the same block, on 27 July.

Dauid Hussain, 31, was stabbed in the throat in the same block of Sparkbrook on 31 July. Abdul Malik, 29, was stabbed in the head in the same area on 1 August. Aftab Ahmed, 30, was also stabbed in the head in the same area on 1 August.

Two men, one of whom is married to Faraaz Ahmed, were also tied up in the same area for the second time on 4 August, after a series of attacks.

Mr Wightman said the two men had appeared at Birmingham Crown Court on three separate dates in December, after which the couple were released after prosecutors dropped the trial date.

He said: "What we're doing now is an action that's been referred to as judicial review of his [Faraaz Ahmed's] acquittal.

"A judicial review is an action to appeal a decision. It basically takes an appeal to the High Court and is an independent application for judicial review."

A spokesman for the Home Office said it "would not comment on individual cases".

"The court also upheld all other indictments."

Mr Rahman's lawyer, Tair Rahman, told the court the ruling had caused him "emotional distress" but the matter must "go through the proper legal system" so it can be "resolved within the next couple of weeks".

Mr Rahman's brother, Haseeb Khan, who was in court for his client, said: "This whole case is inhumane. We were here to support him. Some people don't know how to treat [people]."
