 information.

With this in mind, the Micius project manager, Dr Dinesh Thakur, said it is impossible to send anything bigger than a 1 megabit message.

"There were certain things on the Mars surface which I thought would be useful for the mission," Dr Thakur said in an interview at the European Research Centre in Kourou, France. "We thought, for example, if we could get a good signal over the mountains, we could send the whole world.

"The problem is that the signal strength is very low - if the signal is at the highest, it will lose strength. So, there will be no time to carry this payload through the atmosphere, therefore we need some quantum information."

Dr Thakur said: "A lot of things on any planet have one of these three properties: that it is magnetic or that its chemical composition will affect the size you can get through its atmosphere."

Professor Stephen Eynon, director of NASA's Mars Exploration Laboratory (MAL), said the mission represents a step forward in science.

"We know that the planet of Mars once was an atmosphereless, desert planet once," he said. "The fact that these data could be transmitted through the atmosphere is a nice step forward. This is certainly much finer than what we've come up with before and it is exciting. I think we're the first people to measure the chemistry on this planet and think we can measure the solar system to a much finer structure."

The research was recently published in the journal Nature Geoscience.
