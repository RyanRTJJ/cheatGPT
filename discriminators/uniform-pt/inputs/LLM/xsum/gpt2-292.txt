 the past to punish repeat offenders, but some officials say it's outdated.

Some officers have been assigned to patrol the city's West Side to keep things simple. Others work out of buildings like the city's main parking lot.

All told, the officers have had their training for 30 years.

HELP, Hawaii: An early morning of the night, the head of Hawaiian Airlines Flight 93, Jim Hall, told his family he'd like the people in the hijacked plane to get out of their cars, only for them to take them outside to board.

The flight attendants were so impressed with his enthusiasm, the flight attendants and employees put some stickers on their cars saying, "We're not allowed out there in those backyards of the Hawaiian Islands!"

Hall and his family said they were forced to "let things play out on the street." They said the hijackers had a great idea, a "smooth ride" and that the first person to land on the plane did not need to use his car until everyone left.

He said he's had a chance to tell his story before and he doesn't believe that anyone that was caught up in the mess has ever seen a hijacker before.

Hall's cousin, David Brown, was at his family's store the day the plane crashed.

"He used to fly out in the morning, but now it's almost the same time that it's midnight in Hawaii; you get to sleep at dawn and think, What'll happen if I do another hijack a couple minutes later? What will I lose? And not be able to take another phone call at night."
