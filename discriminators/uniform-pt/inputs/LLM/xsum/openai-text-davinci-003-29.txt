 7-3

England's Phil 'The Power' Taylor has become the first player to win the PDC World Darts Championship title six times, after a 7-3 victory over former champion Adrian Lewis.

The 45-year-old produced a faultless performance at Alexandra Palace in London, setting a world record in the process by averaging 103.88 in the final.

Lewis, the 24-year-old `Jackpot' from Stoke-on-Trent, was no match for Taylor in the Â£200,000 tournament as the world number one repeated his 2011 success.

Afterwards, Taylor said: "I felt I was better tonight than last year. I feel like I'm getting better.

"I had to play better darts than I have in the past, but I'm just lucky that I've done it."

The man from Stoke-on-Trent has now lifted the Sid Waddell Trophy on seven occasions in total, equalling the record held by Eric 'The Crafty Cockney' Bristow.

"It's unbelievable," added Taylor, who won the first of his 24 world titles in 1990. "Coming back here tonight I felt a million pounds, I can tell you.

"It's not just about winning. It's about performing. I've done it."

In Saturday's semi-final, Taylor had beaten world number two and reigning champion Gary `The Flying Scotsman' Anderson 10-6.

Before that, Taylor had enjoyed comfortable wins over Jamie Caven, Scott Rand and a thrilling 4-3 success over Dave Chisnall in the quarter-finals.

Taylor started the final against Lewis with a 180, and proceeded to win
