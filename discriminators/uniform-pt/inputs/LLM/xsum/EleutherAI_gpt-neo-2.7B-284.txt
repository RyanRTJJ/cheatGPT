 A proposed change to the London Plan would see the council write to the Department for Transport asking for a law change.

The suggestion comes from local cycling campaigners. The change would require the Department for Transport to provide a formal response within 45 days.



As well as adding to the number of “right” turns on the road, and removing the driver of a lorry from a legal test of a cyclist to the left, the change would see cyclists having to give way on the left only on a lane with a solid white line when overtaking between two motor vehicles.

This comes despite reports that motorists are continuing to get out and give the cyclist a right of way – something Cycling UK wrote to the Department of Transport over.

Cycling UK wrote: “A survey carried out in June 2012, found that only one third of the cyclists interviewed knew (or suspected) how a right turn should be signalled in their road environment. This information is vital in improving cycling safety on our roads and improving safety for all road users.

“The failure to inform cyclists is dangerous because many cyclists (even experienced ones) don’t use turn signals or wear high-visibility clothing.”



The report also notes that a recent analysis of Cycle Space, a free tool designed to improve cyclist safety, finds that, by making motorists and cyclists less likely to signal left, the amount of right turn space has fallen by almost 20% and has been cut in half in recent years compared with four years ago.

Commenting on the suggestions, London Cycling Campaign’s chief policy officer, Mike Hookem, said: “As we’ve seen over the last couple of years, the Highway Code is being used by many local councils to enforce a code of conduct on cyclists which can have a chilling effect.

“We need to protect our vulnerable road users and the Highway Code needs to be updated and made fit for purpose, especially when it comes to making sure that more right turns are left – cyclists aren’t turning right onto
