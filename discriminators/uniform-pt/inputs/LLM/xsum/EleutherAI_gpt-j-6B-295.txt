,500 tonnes of asphalt has been laid on the run-in to the island section.

The majority of the funding comes from the Scottish Government and British Cycling via Sport Scotland.

A further Â£60,000 is being used to improve access to the island section by creating a dedicated pathway for pedal cyclists, pedestrians and skateboarders on the west side of the island.

The island access improvements are estimated to cost Â£150,000, with the island section improvements estimated to cost Â£40,000.

The Â£2.3m is being used to repair the island section and resurface a Â£1m investment in the section.

CycleSport, who are managing the project, are hoping to use the section as a test track so next years race can be part of the Olympic Games.

Commenting on the project, NW200 Race Director, Martin Collins, said: "I think an island section is essential to the success of any major event.

"The NW200 has proved itself to be an annual contender for hosting an Olympics cycling event, and the improvement of the island is a key part of our preparations to deliver that."

Scottish Wheelers Association Cycling Coordinator, Mike Smith, was delighted with the improvements which had been made to the route.

"The island section improvements will definitely help to boost the race profile of the event and improve spectator enjoyment.

"It's also been great to see the route has developed at the other end of the island too, with improvements to the run-in into Peel and the addition of so many brand new bales and kerbs at the start and finish," he said.

The race's Â£1.2m in sponsorship from the Coors Light also will be used for improvements on the island section.

Mr Smith added: "I think we are all looking forward to the race next year and seeing how it fares on the new island.

"It's all very exciting, especially seeing such big improvements."

The event gets underway on July 16th and the full route can be downloaded here or on the event website here.
