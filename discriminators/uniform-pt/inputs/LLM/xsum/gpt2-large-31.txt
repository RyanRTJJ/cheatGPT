 the rest of his career as well is a fantastic feeling for all of us," said Queen's Director of Sports and Heritage David Gyngell. "You never really get these kind of outcomes in golf so we are delighted.

"We want everybody to have a great time at Queen's and this will be a fantastic addition to the Club's calendar. We are obviously very pleased that Andy will be making his return to the Club this year."

Andy Murray's career has already endured some controversy, having been dropped from the British and Irish Lions Tour that he had been set to attend shortly after his 2014 season was cut short by illness, his return in May 2015 being cut short when an injury to his foot forced the decision. He has since been included in this year's Ashes squad for the first time since joining the competition in 2012.

He will now return to play his second Ashes Test later in the year. "It's a massive honour to get back to The Queen's again," said Murray. "The tour has already been great to play on in the summer and I am looking forward to playing one in this great place. It will be great to see a different type of crowds and feel the excitement of The Queen's Club in the autumn of this season."

He previously said: "Playing the tour has been a great experience both for me and the team. It's been very eye-opening and hopefully is something I can carry onto becoming the leading player in your category."

Queen's also has the biggest winter calendar in the professional world and has a further seven big tournaments all being held over the course of the year. Many clubs are seeking to add to this with the final three rounds of the year being held
