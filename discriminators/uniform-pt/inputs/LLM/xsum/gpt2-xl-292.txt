 the US prisons for quite some time. These include "restorative sentencing," an element of the justice system in which people commit crimes, get support to help them become a better person, then go back to the community, and help those communities. It works, and it reduces the likelihood of them doing things like committing more crimes. But it can be difficult to implement when there are all kinds of complexities in criminal law.

The question for people is, will the Trump administration's move to undo these changes actually help reduce the problem?

"It just seems like so much hand-wringing and so many folks who oppose this are willing to say things that are actually counterproductive."

On Wednesday, the Trump administration sent letters to the leaders of the federal criminal justice system, asking them to tell the public which programs should remain and which should be cut. The letter specifically asked about the use of diversion, which has been shown in studies to be beneficial to reentry, especially for people without a criminal history. But for people who already have that history, it could potentially be harmful.

"There's always such pushback against diversion," says David Kennedy, executive director of the American Citizens Crime Commission (ACCC), an advocacy organization for low-income Americans. "But on the whole, when it works it works, and the results are overwhelmingly positive and well-received."

The commission's survey suggested that 1.6 percent of the 1.1 million people who said they went to prison or jail in the past year actually returned to prison. But it's unclear if that's because they were getting help for specific reasons like drug addiction, or to keep a low profile so as to be eligible for their work programs. To Kennedy, the fact that many people are already going to prison for a crime they don't really commit is evidence that diversion is a success.

It's still possible that diversion could help some offenders reorder their lives in terms of their career paths and
