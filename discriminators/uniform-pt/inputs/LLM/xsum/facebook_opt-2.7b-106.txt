 the countries included in US President Barack Obama's ban on laptop computers onboard a single-engine passenger plane travelling between Europe and the United States. The ban was also imposed on planes flying between Europe and any other North American country where the government has deemed there is an imminent threat of terrorism.

The ban was introduced at the tail end of a week where the US was reeling from a number of terror attacks, including one at the Orlando gay nightclub.

Speaking about the decision, French Transport Minister Alain Vidalies said: “France now considers that the risk from these threats is no longer as serious as it had been in the past.”

"I cannot imagine that people who have a concern will still buy an air ticket with a laptop," an aviation security official from the United Arab Emirates was reported as saying at the time.

US officials were not available for comment on what made them think that the risk of a laptop bomb on a plane had “declined”, but the Washington Post cited a senior US official as saying: "We do believe the threat is less than it was a year ago."

This would appear to contradict Obama's pledge a month later to expand the ban to include planes travelling to Europe from "any other" Middle Eastern country. Officials at the US National Security Council were not immediately available for comment on that claim.

"We are not ready for a single aircraft,” the UAE official was reported as saying at the time. “But the technology is there.”

US investigators have not been able to determine what is being used to mount the devices, but American officials have not ruled out terrorists creating a device on their home soil, using equipment such as explosive liquid or thermite.

“At this time there is no intelligence linking a laptop to a specific threat,” US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said when asked if US officials were considering banning laptops on flights.

In total, there are a dozen countries included in the laptop ban on single-engine aircraft, including Britain, which has banned them
