 chose their favourite.

The results, outlined in a paper in the journal Scientific Reports, revealed that participants, who are generally happy, were also more likely to prefer being involved – whether in a sports competition, a personal relationship, or having a professional career – over getting what they wanted at work.

They wrote, "When a desire is fulfilled and its satisfaction is associated with an increased sense of happiness, that feeling is a'reward."

"So, in short, the human mind is an automatic, reward-like mechanism," the researchers wrote in the paper.

They did not find the same result with anger, however, as "these negative emotions are more likely to be associated with feeling pain when one feels a reward."

"We conclude that emotional excitement is not the sole or even exclusive reward in daily life. It may be one of thousands – if not the greatest – of non-rewarding experiences", the authors wrote.

Researchers suggest that this could encourage people to seek out activities and rewards they "believe" will improve their lives and the quality of their lives.
