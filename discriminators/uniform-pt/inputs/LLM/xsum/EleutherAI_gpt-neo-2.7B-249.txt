 not recognize Dayan's appointment. Dayan is director of the Jewish Agency of Brazil and a former ambassador to Paraguay.

Hussein has said the only possible reason for a delay would be because the U.N. would reject such a nomination. "We believe that this type of nomination can only be accepted if the Secretary-General of the United Nations has explicitly endorsed the nomination," Hussein's spokesman, Husam Badran, said Friday.

It's not the only problem: Brazil also has other diplomatic appointments without approval from foreign ministers, including in Syria, Nicaragua, Iraq, and elsewhere.

Brazil's rejection of Dayan's appointment is the most pressing of these complaints. But it's likely not the only one. In fact, many Latin American diplomats who deal with Israel find themselves in hot water for approving such appointments.

"As a diplomat you try to promote the interest of the countries under your jurisdiction," says Michael Herz, former Argentine ambassador to Israel and former dean of the Argentine College of Foreign Relations.

"Brazil has the highest standard of ethics, honesty and openness in terms of administration, and this is one of its principles as well as its policies – to support good governance of the countries it represents and their policies," he says.

And Pessoa thinks the government really only took such action out of a belief that this would not affect relations with other countries or that it would be less controversial.

But we can be sure this type of appointment had an impact."

Other diplomats who have heard criticism of these appointments feel the opposite.
