 asset, was accused of using his position, "with the support of Kremlin security services", to recruit a Russian spy to infiltrate US groups and to steal US information from them. Two Russian nationals, Anatoly Papanov and Ilya Ponomarev, were arrested in the US following an investigation led by Justice Department.

Mr Fogle, a Russian-born American citizen who has been repeatedly accused by US agencies of attempting to recruit a Russian intelligence officer, was charged with working as an agent while trying to recruit a Russian spy.

The FBI alleges that Mr Fogle attempted to recruit a Russian spy while providing cover for the Russian spy, who was working to illegally penetrate the United States through the Internet.

On July 31, the US accused him of attempting to recruit a Russian intelligence officer while working for the CIA.

A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman says it is too early to say Mr Fogle could be the 'black cat' from Moscow who killed one of the Russian men. The spokeswoman was asked to comment on Mr Papanov's death.

The official said Moscow would not "jump to conclusions" and it was too early to decide whether this Russian spy would be the 'black cat' that killed Mr Papanov. The official also refused to comment on Mr Ponomarev, though he was charged as a suspect.

Mr Papanov and Mr Ponomarev were accused of working for the Russian secret services in the US. They entered the United States illegally and sought access to US computer systems and documents there.

The Russian news agency RIA-Novosti quoted Aleksandr Deryabin, head Moscow's Federal Security Bureau's counter-intelligence agency, as saying that the two Russian nationals have been detained in the United States. He would not elaborate on the suspects' identities. He would not comment on their arrest. He would not confirm whether the two men were accused of spying for Russia.

Mr Deryabin would not address why the two Russians were on American soil in the first place. He would not comment on why such allegations have been made.
