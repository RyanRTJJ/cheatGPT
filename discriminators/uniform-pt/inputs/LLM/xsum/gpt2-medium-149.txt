arkshire, Scotland, East Riding, West Riding and rural areas in Scotland.

The first two phases of the Inventory of Historic Battlefields contained sites in the Borders, Aberdeenshire, the Highlands, North Lanarkshire, Scotland, East Riding, West Riding and rural areas in Scotland. The Inventory of Historic Battlefields also contains areas in Scotland which are not covered under this site

The first six areas are of particular interest to archaeologists as each of these sites contain valuable archaeological resources for those wanting to study the history of the Wars of the Roses and the conflict in Great Britain.

The Inventory of Historic Battlefields was established to bring together all 19 sites from the Inventory of Historic Battlefields and provides unique and invaluable opportunities for researchers and historians to research events and conflicts from before William MacLeish and Sir Charles Luttrell came to power and their impact on the lives of the people involved.

The inventory covers both Civil War periods of the 18th and 19th centuries and focuses mostly on those that occurred during that period, the 'Great War'. However, it also includes sites with historic connections to the modern era, such as the Northern Fleet in the Isle of Wight and the Northern Guard at St Mary Magdalene.
