 micro-lender in the world to go this route.

The bank, located in an old warehouse beside Glasgow Caledonian University (GCSU), has issued 1,900 micro loans, in which the repayments are linked up with a credit line of interest-free loans, from local companies with commercial premises on the micro-lending site. These loans are linked to an investor's personal guarantee. These micro-loans are only available on payday and in cases of emergency which is when loans may be extended for 24 hours or more. No funds is transferred from the investors to be repayable to the project.

"The business plan has been designed to ensure the project can be self-sustaining, and by doing this, it's possible to avoid using the loans for the development of the micro-lending platform," says CEO Michael O'Byrne. The idea is that interest-free loans from the company will be able to fund the project.

The project currently stands at the stage where it can issue loans to about 120 projects. It is also planning to provide further loans to project teams within the next two weeks.

Mr O'Byrne believes that loans are not currently widely available on a regular or affordable basis in developing countries. Since micro-lending operates on tight margins, the founders would like to see micro-lending become more accessible through the introduction of interest-free loans.

Other micro-lenders have found that loans are not as widely available as they would like. In the past, micro-lenders were able to issue loans at a premium or even more. The founders hope that interest on micro-lending will help people obtain a more affordable and accessible option to make their own loans.

"All of the new products are designed to meet the same requirements that a bank would have," says Mr O'Byrne. He states that the products are a way to keep people honest and in good repute. He also explains that this project comes at a perfect time, with interest rates and credit limits rising significantly in the
