The UK Medical Association said a recent survey showed almost all doctors are now aware of the health risks of unnecessary cetirizine, the only drug in which cetuximab fails to work - and is linked to increased cases of fatal sepsis and sepsis-end stage fever.

Including the NHS's largest private employer NHS Employers' Association, doctors have overwhelmingly found the drug is unnecessary."

The union representing NHS doctors criticised the drug and said recent studies had failed to produce conclusive evidence suggesting the use of it had a lasting and significant effect on survival in certain conditions such as chronic kidney failure.

The union says it is too soon to determine whether the safety of cetirizine may be improving because of its rapid approval.

A group of academics led by Sir Nicholas Soames, co-author of the review who has since resigned, has warned that cetirizine has a low effect on the growth of the prostate, but should be regulated to prevent adverse side-effects.

The University of Reading's Simon Chapman-Wright, chief scientific adviser for the Royal College of General Practitioners, has warned that further research is needed at the scale the research has recently been initiated, and he warns of "problems surrounding the efficacy and proper administration of cetirizine".

"The best way to prevent a rise in side-effects and avoid unnecessary cetirizine use is for the industry to stop making use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs which have been shown to cause serious and prolonged side-effects," he said on the BMA news website.

The BMA has also launched a petition calling for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to review the safety of cetirizine.

Rates of sepsis and sepsis-end stage fever, which are related, are rising and are a concern for women who deal with the illness as the disease is transmitted on the same route: via the vagina and bowel.
