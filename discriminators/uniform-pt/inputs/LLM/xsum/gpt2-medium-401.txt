According to the Welsh Housing association's 2014/15 Annual Report, 843 of the 860 council/housing association houses are vacant. That means there are 628 properties left standing. For a local council, the number of vacant dwellings is 1,083 - 628 vacant.

Of those homes, nearly 75 percent are owned by council, 43 percent are held by housing associations.

A property's current value is more important than the current health it is capable of delivering, according to experts.

The average council and housing association home costs £1,814 per year, equivalent to around £21,922 per year.

Caterham's council housing estate, on the other hand, has a price tag of £10,600, the highest in England, according to The Housing Industry News.

Sydney's council housing estate, however, costs around £17,000.

According to the Welsh Housing Association's 2014/15 annual report, 2,146 council and housing association houses currently remain vacant in Wales.

This figures is based on its own research methodology – there has been a review of Wales since 2010 and a further round of changes to the country's Landlord-Tenant Act.

This means, over the past 12 months, housing associations around Welsh areas have either been allowed to stay open and in operation or have been given extensions to their lease duration and prices.

As there have been further housing reforms since the consultation deadline, a study by the Welsh Housing Association's survey is still available online. A Welsh Government response to the poll could come in two years. The Wales Times reports that it has no date set. However, we would expect a response by October.
