 struggling company than losing an experienced boss after five and a half years.

Fung recently received an announcement from his new employer the Sanyu Group that he would not be taking part in China's major pension fund investment program.

"For my part, I'm not going to return to the service of China," Fung told The Guardian. "I believe I can help people. I haven't gone to Hong Kong, which I can't."

Fung left his job as Hong Kong's chief economist in 2013 after being forced out by his own government. He's now the vice-chairman of the Peking University's Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Policy. His departure from that job is surprising given recent history of successful Chinese economic growth.

Fung, who is also a fellow at Peking and a fellow at the Brookings Institution, has said he'll not return to China until he's satisfied with his financial situation. However, he could still return to Singapore, where he's invested in some of the biggest companies in China including Peking University's Huayi Capital ($39.95m), Dalian Wanda Group, Qigong's China Holding Trust ($8.5m), and some of the largest equity investments in Chinese capital markets. That may be a little disappointing to some.

"I think everyone has their issues. The Chinese economy is an extremely weak one," says Fung. "But the China sector will grow and I believe that has to be put in perspective with our investment in other parts of the world â€¦ I'm not going to be part of a global financial system that devalues and then makes them go hungry. That's not what the Chinese economy really is."

With one of the best in the world, Fung can still contribute to the company's growth and diversify a company, even if it doesn't do well. There's no guarantee he'll be back.
