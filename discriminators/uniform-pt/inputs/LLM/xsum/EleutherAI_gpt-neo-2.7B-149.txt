arkshire and the Glasgow area.

A Scottish War Cemetery was established by Lord Lyon Kingant in 1653. It was at first used mainly for burials for soldiers who died in a battle or were ‘blown home’ to make way for additional land to be cleared to make way for the new parliament estate.

It is unclear whether more elaborate cemeteries were designed to cover such sites. In 1847, another ‘battle’ cemetery for casualties was opened at the entrance to the New Entrance to Glasgow Cathedral and in 1899 it was also used in the construction of the new Glasgow Film Theatre. By that time, this site had been the site for ‘the old chapel’, part of the former Newent area, since the end of the 14th century. It became subject to the Lord Lyon Kingant battle cemetery with the extension of Glasgow’s City Council. In 1930 this second Cemetery also fell into disrepair before being cleared in the 1970s.

By 1974 the site had also lost use as an area of common land after the extension of the city wall to the Glasgow Necropolis where it is now the site of a footpath. Many gravestones at the site are those of Glasgow’s working class, the poor, and of the homeless and unemployed.

The majority of the Glasgow’s burials are members of the Glasgow Corporation and other institutions. As far as is known only two burials are Scottish troops, the first was that of Lieutenant-Colonel Gartside, killed by Jacobites during the 1746 rising in Dumfries before a body was buried, in 1831, at Wigton Military Cemetery. The second was that of Charles Hamilton, killed by the French cavalry near Haddo.

The majority of the burials are those of women from the upper class who died after marriage and children. A total of 841 women of the Glasgow elite, and their relatives, are buried here.

The burials here include the daughters of Dr James MacKay Macleod, a leading member of the City Company of Free and Accepted Masons, and his wife Joan, both of whom were buried here at the Glasgow Necropolis.
