 the Royal Australian & New Zealand College of Paediatrics and Child Health found that "the absence of intervention for these two years caused immediate death in the child." It added that the "significant impact" of the children's isolation on Baby Imran was compounded by the risk that he would "become lost or disoriented" while sleeping on his parents' bed.
