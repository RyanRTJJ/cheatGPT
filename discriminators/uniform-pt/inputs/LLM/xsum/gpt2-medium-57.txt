"Bolstering the current law against fires burning in gardens has a beneficial effect on fires' effectiveness," Stewart said. "The current law also encourages fires to flare early and not late in hot weather but this is not appropriate in summer months."

Nanaimo Conservative MP Tony Coady said he will support increasing the fire danger areas on the island.

"I will vote against any increase that makes us less safe," Coady said.

On behalf of his motion to increase maximum fire zones, Coady said it was unreasonable to require fire-fighting companies, or firefighters, to be outside of areas where they may not be needed.

He said while the increase is not recommended by the Ontario Government, Coady believed it would be a wise proposal, considering the high risks in certain areas. Coady said the province should consider lowering the fire risk areas to include areas where fire risks remain.

The increase is required by the federal government, but there has been no recommendation yet from the provincial government.

Stewart said after a study conducted by the city of Vancouver, it discovered a correlation between smaller fire danger areas and higher numbers of fires in summer months.

The increase would impact 2,500 structures, but a further 15,000 would be affected if they receive the fire hazard designation. About 4,200 firefighting vehicles would be required to respond to more fire events in summer months.

Meanwhile, the federal government has suggested that B.C.'s Fire Services Commission may change the way it manages fire risk areas for smaller communities. The current designation has the goal of reducing fire incidents in some areas.

The proposed change to the fire risk areas would affect about 2,200 structures, but at the same time, the number of vehicles responding could climb to approximately 10,000. Meanwhile, crews at smaller fire hazard areas could respond to more fires in summer months.

In a written statement provided to CBC News, BC Wildfire and Fire Services Canada said: "Fire hazards are not an easy problem to address, however, we must continue to review our fire status code, which is the basis of the current fire status code for large fire emergencies,
