 world record holder is unlikely to train ahead of the August 1-4 world championships in Eugene, Oregon, after just four weeks of preparation. "There's still a chance that I will be able to participate in the world championships," Bolt said this week. "I'm not sure yet, but I know I'll get everything done and I'll be fully recovered before the world championships. I'm really positive that it will all be fine. I think I'll be fine." Bolt also had an operation last year, to repair a torn groin muscle. The 2009 world 100 metres record-holder has been training for just two months since that operation and had planned to train for only six weeks before the world championships. "This year, I was trying to get a full load of workouts into each week," Bolt told ESPN, adding that since his injury, he's had to limit the amount of running he can do. "Everything came back so early," he said. "You have the knee, you have this. Now, you have this and you have an infection." Bolt had hoped to be ready for Olympic trials this year, but that was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. "It's been a really terrible year for everyone, and especially athletes," he said. "We just hope that come August everything will be back to normal." Bolt said he has been watching videos of athletes with disabilities, which inspired him on one of his recovery sessions this month. "I felt so motivated," he said. "I just really wanted to show myself that I could do it. "You know what I mean? I remember being like, when I lost a friend on the track, all those years ago, how hard it hurt to lose someone." Bolt is expected to be replaced in next week's Diamond League meeting in Monaco by Kenyan world 400 metres record-holder David Rudisha.
