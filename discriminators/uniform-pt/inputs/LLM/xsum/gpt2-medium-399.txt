 $2 trillion plant in the UK to manufacture iPhones under contract with Apple.

Apple will also pay Â£732 million to settle two class action lawsuits brought by customers of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

The court hearing for the cases could start as early as Wednesday afternoon, and is set to last about 80 minutes.

This is an explosive turn of events for Brexit and how the EU negotiates its business and trading relationship with Britain. The court date will mean that some business can no longer claim to have been misled by the EU, and Britain could have to deal with a trade dispute with the EU that it has denied.

The court had previously ruled: "While there was no legal case to support the applicants' claims", and given that they were not "maintained under false pretenses", it could therefore not proceed.

This decision means that a massive EU legal battle may have been lost, but for a single EU lawsuit, which is the subject of the first trial in the case, as well as the latest announcement that Apple will no longer be able to continue selling iPhones under contract with the European Commission (EC).

The case was brought against Apple by a former Apple employee, Mr Benjamin J. Leeson, who claimed that he was misled about the legal status. He was suing Apple for its iPhone and iPads to make profits, and then over the phone and tablet sales of the devices.

Leeson sued Apple last year over Apple's refusal to provide employees and manufacturing facilities for the EU projects but the EU has refused to allow the companies to go through a settlement after the trial.

According to Reuters, Mr Leeson's claim will be heard in front of Baroness Sir Peter Trades, the former chief judge for the Court of Justice of the EU. The court hearing is set to last about 80 minutes. Apple has not yet filed its case as yet, but with Brexit negotiations continuing, it cannot just sit around and wait for the proceedings to
