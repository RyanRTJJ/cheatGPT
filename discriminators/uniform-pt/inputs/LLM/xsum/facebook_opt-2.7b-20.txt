 and the electricity will be taken off the grid in March, the Guardian reports.

The move could have negative effects for the climate because the decommissioning of these coal-fired power plants results in the emissions of carbon dioxide into the stratosphere, according to a study by environmental lawyers at the University of the West of England.

The shutdown process will take place gradually over the first half of next year, and will be carried out so as not to disrupt the lives of local communities or local businesses. Once it is fully operational, the plants will produce no greenhouse gas emissions to the planet.

The government has previously said that the last fossil fuels in Britain will no longer be generated prior to 2025, but is looking at how to gradually phase them out once they become more expensive to produce.

The country is already committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050. The National Grid, which operates the grid that covers Britain, is also looking at alternative options to cut emissions and reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2035.

Renewables such as wind, tidal and hydro power, for example, are being considered to replace some of the retiring coal-fired plants. The electricity grid is still largely reliant on coal even for electricity produced around the clock.

According to the Guardian, experts say the impact of the shutdown will initially be limited, as other electricity generators such as gas, nuclear and even hydropower will step in to make up for the energy shortfall. But if the island shuts off production completely, it could lead to the loss of electricity to some of Britain's largest and most remote communities.

The closure of all coal-fired power plants by 2024 is part of the energy sector's response to the Climate Change Act. The law aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050, and by 90 percent by mid-century.
