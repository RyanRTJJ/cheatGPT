), and how they will be announced. There are, however, many possibilities. There are possibilities, as I described in "The Power of a Public Statement on Iraq," including "In an op-ed," as President Bush once did, "An article in The New York Times" published under headline "The Right Way to Fight" and "On The Record by the President," as President Obama has done in recent days, "A teleconference on the Internet" or of all three of these possibilities, but we'll probably hear no more than the second one. It is interesting that the "opinion piece" in The New York Times that I was asked about -- the one that was written by David Brooks and published in the op-ed section this morning -- is the very same one I was asked about last July by Bob Schieffer, who is, I think, an astute observer of how the government reacts in response to an attack. It was "The Right Way to Fend," and, as we know, it was very nearly never published. But, as I explained there, Brooks was talking about the right way to fight a war in the era of "information wars," not in the era of war at peace. And the question of what would happen if, for tactical reasons, the president did not want to address the world in such a way, is as unanswerable as the question of what would happen if the president did not release a National Security Council memo on the assassination of President Kennedy as part of a carefully crafted speech that he intended to give that same evening. But there are some other possibilities, and they're worth considering, because it would be amazing if we found out that we would not be hearing about one, and only one, of these many possibilities for how to treat an attack on America, even if it were an unwise decision.

The first possibility is an official announcement, at some level of government, that there is a danger that Saddam Hussein will launch a weapon of mass destruction and that his regime is a threat to America that requires a military response. A military response is being considered, and, unless some significant decision is made that I'm not aware of -- and I'm not sure that there is
