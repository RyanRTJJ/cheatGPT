 to the image. Now the image will be removed from the internet for five weeks unless Mr Slater comes forward to answer allegations it was a hoax. He told The Independent this was a "very interesting" case. But in October, he revealed he had received an anonymous email claiming he had hacked computer network of Sony Pictures. The email explained the hack would cost £16,000 for Mr Slater, and would be released if he gave up the identity of one of his victims.

Now he has asked his lawyer David E. Wirth, a lawyer for internet users, to get into a "clandestine meeting" for "interview and preparation for filing a suit against the UK police services" to try to win back his rights. Mr Slater says the £16,000 will be passed to a charity that he says will "help victims of police corruption".
