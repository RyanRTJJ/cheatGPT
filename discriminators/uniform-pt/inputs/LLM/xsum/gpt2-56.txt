Catholics living in districts where no religious test is administered face stiff penalties. They are barred from purchasing a ticket for a bus pass or even giving it out until 10 p.m. Tuesday.

In an interview, Ryan said he and his wife were given a free bus pass for about the same number of people as they would have otherwise by chance.

That was after officials in Flint found about 2,000 new students at one of the city's seven public schools, Ryan said. The report, which was released Tuesday, found about half of those students were non-English speaking. An additional 3,000 students are Catholic, and about 3 percent were non-Catholic while nearly 1,100 received the free school pass for their classes.

The report, issued by county, shows there's a "significantly higher incidence" of students on bus with no test being administered. It recommends district officials conduct a community-oriented screening process for students who appear on any type of program.

Ryan said the schools offer "the full range of services" for students. One of the issues is the need for students with a parent who has to sign a waiver telling the school is "doing something wrong."

He said the county office hasn't received any comments since the report came out.

Pupils said they can donate to local schools. A petition on Change.org to increase the number of schools in the city has been started.
