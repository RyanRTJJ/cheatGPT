 a further inquiry and on Saturday a panel found one of Dr Soh Chin Yong, a consultant obstetrician, guilty for the serious charge.

In all, the commission fined Dr Soh $300,000, ordered him to apologise to the girl and suspended him for six months. He must also complete 30 hours of counselling over the incident.

In January a court had reprimanded six doctors, including the obstetrician in the case, over the same incident in 2006. But Dr Soh had appealed the decision.

According to the ruling, Dr Soh had approached the girl when he saw her at the hospital. He had told her she was pregnant and offered her $150 to keep the baby.

She refused, saying she wanted an abortion and asked whether her case could be made to fall within the ban on termination of life by the mentally unsound law.

Dr Soh had insisted it would not because she had been made pregnant in a "happening of chance". He told the girl she was not in the wrong as she had consented to the abortion. But she had not consented.

The girl, now 18, had gone back to the hospital for assistance and found Dr Soh there. She complained to the hospital and was referred to the clinic.

The two doctors entered her room and asked her to have the abortion. She had been told to go to a clinic run by pro-life groups who would transport her to the Philippines for the procedure. This was an illegal operation that is against the law.

The girl had also been encouraged to file a police report but was afraid to do so. She had also feared being deported from Singapore.

Despite this, the doctors had made her travel to Kallinikattu, a town in the Philippines, for the abortion.

She later gave birth to a baby girl who weighed 3.7kg and survived.

The case reached the national courts last year. In addition to Dr Soh and Dr Ngiam Wee Li, the Singapore Medical Council appealed against the reprimands.

The court found Dr Soh partly at fault for breaching the professional boundaries with the girl and Dr Ngiam for breaching professional boundary of confidentiality.
