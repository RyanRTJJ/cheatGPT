As for the Real Madrid players, it looks like there was good news for them last Sunday. The 27-year-old Spaniard and Brazilian was the main threat at times this time last season, scoring five goals per game for Atletico.

The game will not be the same for the younger players but will be the final straw for Villaraigosa and the Portuguese.

With Atletico missing three of the last four at home, Villaraigosa has a chance of sealing the home win in Madrid before next week's Champions League final between the two clubs.
