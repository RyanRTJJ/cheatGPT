 anyone with information to come forward.

"We are all shocked. We are in shock to think that anything like this might ever happen on a Met Police car - with their lives at risk as soon as they stepped out of the car," he said.

"The Met is not saying who the officers are, but the information they have given me leads me to believe that it is a significant force."

Mr Lawrence has urged anyone with any information to contact Scotland Yard, by calling 0800 40 50 40, quoting reference 6484315.

He also urged anyone involved to come forward with information.

"If you have any information about this, or you see a suspicious person or vehicle, do not hesitate.

"Go off the beaten track, and if you hear anything and it looks or sounds like a police officer, they are probably a policeman. Run, grab a phone, and call and report it to the police."

The officer, who was in his 30s, was based in Clapham Junction, south London.

He was off duty for a shift at 3.40pm on Saturday, and travelling to or from his home in Kent when the incident happened.

Police said that he would have been carrying his radio on the front seat, and his gun on the rear bench.

The vehicle is understood to have passed through the area at speed, before coming to rest at the side of the road. There were no witnesses.

Superintendent Barry Lewis said he did not want to go into details of the incident, but described it as a "serious matter".

"My officers take their duty to the public very, very seriously and their lives and their very lives hang in the balance," he added.

Superintendent Lewis would not confirm whether the officer is still with the Met Police - or if he is in police custody.

The incident marks the latest in a long line of high-profile cases involving London's police.

In October 2009, Met Police officer Constable Robert Hirst, who was aged 44, was gunned down by masked and armed men on a train as he travelled home from London for the weekend.

It was the second high-profile killing on
