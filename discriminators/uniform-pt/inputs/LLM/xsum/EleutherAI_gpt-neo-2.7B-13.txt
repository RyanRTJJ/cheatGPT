 Dybwad RFC had scored a hat-trick of tries and was joined on the scoresheet by Dan Evans. The team had just won the first-ever Welsh club match, with Welsh clubs dominating the Welsh rugby world. For Dybwad, this was a real team moment. It was their second game against Rhys Edwards’ Rhys Edwards RFC on the same evening, and the second meeting between rugby-playing teams from the Vale of Glamorgan and Cardiff.

Evans has been involved with the club since 1979 and has trained many of his players over the years—they have all played on Saturday in Rhys Edwards’s youth team. Their record against
