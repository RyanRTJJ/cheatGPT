 filled within a year's time.
The firm's plan is to be the second-largest non-union staffing agency in the country.

For the time being, O'Connell says they do not have any firm plans for expansion.

'The one thing we need right now is people to step up and come join us to bring this thing through, because we're going to be hiring at all three locations by the end of September'

In a statement, CEO Mark Coyle said:

“We are pleased to have the opportunity to put together a very unique team for these new virtual roles and are delighted that the work ethic of OneSource staff will allow us to continue to offer their client-base a very high level of support and value through our virtual business.”

“We want to thank all of those who took the time to apply as they know the competition and high demand for jobs were fierce.”

The firm is a member of the EMC, Efma, and the AHRB Code of Business Conduct.

Mr Coyle also added:

“It is no exaggeration to say we are living in what I would consider to be a unique time in history so we need to ensure we all do our best to ensure we’re prepared for all eventualities and we will be at all of our locations by the end of September.”

“Our goal is that everyone that wants a job with OneSource will have a job with OneSource.”

“We’re very proud of our unique culture and the company we have built and we hope to have our Derry location open as soon as possible.”

“That all comes to fruition when I say we are going to be staffing three locations by the end of September with all our associates.”

“Once that is done, we have a very strong plan to move into the United Kingdom and we have several locations on our radar when I say ‘radar.’”
