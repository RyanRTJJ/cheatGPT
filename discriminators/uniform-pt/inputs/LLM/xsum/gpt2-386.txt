"It is a very strong symbol for the UK and also for the entire country, as well as for the people of England. At the moment we don't know what the intention is of the fans or players or supporters of England, but they can understand that the lyrics of the anthem are quite strong," Perkins told BBC Radio Lancashire.

"If we can make them appreciate the history of the nation and see what was done it's a tremendous privilege. I think the fans in England can appreciate that history too, and I think they can look at that as a privilege too."

"We've had this song every day for six weeks. It's been very, very special this evening, because of their great achievements and because of what they've made as a football team," Perkins said. "The England anthem was used the week before they had played in Hampstead Heath. It was never used before, but this evening it was used.

"I think it's very symbolic because if you've got some of the best players in the world and you've got good players, and you look around at the players who represent us that will see us on the pitch, it speaks of our greatness and it shows a big part of this country."

However, the song was sung for more than 50 years by people standing against a flag and marching, and it was sung by dozens as England went through a period of national mourning following the British war in 1917.

As well as one of the top players in the game, Shakespeare performed the song with his son Alexander,
