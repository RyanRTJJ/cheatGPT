 look after the grandparents.

The first one of the boyband was born in 1995, in a hospital in Cyprus with the help of his brother and sister, and the second in 2002.

The oldest was eight when he and his brother left their mother and brother in England and moved to Cyprus.

This is when they began working as singing talents, and appeared as backing vocalists (with their father as a coach) in many of their bandmates' songs.

And, they now have over 13 million social media followers.

The boys went to a music school in Nicosia, with their father and two of their brothers.

But, like all of us, they fell out (over their music career) and the younger two, were sent to live with their grandmother for a while.

Their mum went back to England, though.

They returned to Cyprus in 2010, and since then their dad has been working as a film director - while their grandmother has been looking after them.

Who is Liam Payne?

Liam - or Paddy as he is known to fans - was born in Bolton, and began performing with his brother Noel and brother-in-law Nick Grimshaw on a Sunday afternoon television show called This Morning.

However, when he was seven years old he auditioned for the band One Direction and he is known simply as 1D.

They are currently on a world tour with a show scheduled to take place in Liverpool next month, starting October 14.

Speaking about the band, he revealed: "It doesn’t feel like work – I genuinely love what I do and I think you can really see that through our performances.

"We are really close with each other and there’s a genuine respect."

He added: "A lot of people say we don’t look like we take our work seriously and that’s not true. We want to make every show the best show it can be."

Liam has a daughter, Bear Rain, whose name means 'rainbow' in Mandarin and he's often seen holding her in one hand and his phone in the
