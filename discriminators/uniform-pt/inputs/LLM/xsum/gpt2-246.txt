 suggesting a "strong security establishment" will be there to maintain the relationship.

Speaking to reporters in Beijing on Sunday, Mr Ren said all of the top figures in the company were "working for the Chinese government" but stressed their firm remained "neutral on the North Korea issue".

"China should not be saying that we are the only team with that vision that we're working for, because we have strong security and economic ties in the country," he said.

"But this shouldn't be an argument that China itself has a right to influence things. That should stay the same."

NHS Secretary-General Jack Dorsey recently told state media that China was willing to help protect the environment and to stop North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.

Asked whether this could include providing aid to China, Mr Dorsey said "as long as we are doing what we are doing and upholding our international obligations, North Korea has the right to reach the international community".

Mr Ren described Mr Duncan's words as being "unmistakably tongue-in-cheek".

He added: "I believe that it's possible to be cautious in the absence of strong security relationships, especially in the context of an economic relationship."

A spokesman for Huawei's North Korea unit in Singapore, who has been at the receiving end of criticism from Beijing for its anti-Chinese stance, welcomed Mr Ren's comments but added: "For the past many years, NRC has maintained a quiet, non-threatening relationship with its customers and our commitment always came with commitment, never shy of making important and important contributions and the importance we place on having a strong and prosperous relationship with China," the spokesman said.

He added that it would take a strong and independent North Korea to find a "stable path" to resolve the issues facing China and to meet security in the event of conflict.
