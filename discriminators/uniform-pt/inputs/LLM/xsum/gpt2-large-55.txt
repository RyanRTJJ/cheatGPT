The report said: "There has been a significant increase in the number of people being referred to NHS teams due to symptoms of CSE; however, many further cases are currently not being reported."


The first public mention of what it termed "an under-reported, under-diagnosed" problem came in September 2015 when the head of mental health at London's Lincolnshire hospital, Gail Saunders, said the hospital had seen "at least two patients and two families suffering from mental health difficulties".

Most young people between the ages of 12 and 19 were affected, the proportion rising from 25 per cent to 40 per cent.

The most common cause of CSE – also known as childhood adversity, or CSE because this is what causes the illnesses – was physical in nature.


The report estimated that there were between 16 and 20 other groups of young people who could also be suffering in various ways. This was primarily due to the fact that more girls than boys were affected, with the same rate of CSE across the age spectrum seen for both sexes.

The NHS warned in May that there was a "sharp increase" in the number of young people and young adults with CSE, and that more were developing mental health problems.
