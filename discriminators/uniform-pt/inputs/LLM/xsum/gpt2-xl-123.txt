The telescope, set to be launched on December 14 at a cost of £6m, will be the world's next generation space radar.

"Today we have a step closer to having a global space radar system, with the addition of the European Space Agency's future astronomical X-ray telescope, XMM-Newton, and the U.K. Astronomy and Astrophysics Group's future telescope, The James Webb Space Telescope, which will be the most powerful telescope ever launched," added Dr McBride.

"This is a great day for both our European and British Space Agencies and for science in the UK as a whole," said John Womersley, director general of the British Astronomical Association (BA). "The European Space Agency has been one of the key drivers for the development of UK facilities and programmes. The £6 million investment from the government makes that a whole lot more worthwhile."

The UK is currently building three of its own radar satellite systems - the two for XMM-Newton and a third planned for the first stage of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST): the Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A (SPIDER-1A), and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer for the Deep Space Environment (AVHRR), named AVRHR for short.

JWST's first-stage mirrors, already being designed, will be assembled in the UK, with the rest of the telescope built in Europe. That means it will see much of the X-ray sky, which is important for studying the origins and evolution of galaxies, star formation, interstellar clouds, dark matter particles and new stellar formation, to name just a few of the many, many fields it will be used for.

Tim Peake, who used to work at JWST in Malindi, Tanzania, in 2012-13, is already used to flying low, with more flights to come at
