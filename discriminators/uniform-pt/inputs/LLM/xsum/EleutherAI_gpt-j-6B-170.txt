-year-old could miss next month’s London Marathon, the biggest stage of her career.

The marathon is one of four London events that has been scheduled around the world’s most prestigious athletic meeting in early April.

Nemeth’s operation is scheduled for Tuesday.

Nemeth’s agent confirmed her recovery after surgery.

“Katinka is recovering well, as is very confident that she will be back to full health before London in two months’ time,” he told The Telegraph newspaper.

Nemeth has also been linked with a bid for the New York City Marathon next October.

The Hungarian is in second place for this year’s London Marathon with a 3:14:56 on Friday. She has already taken a share of the world record with her 3:05.08.

Nemeth says that running on grass is a dream. I think most grass-running races would tell the world they do not want her to compete. But for her? She’s back on the pavement!

I really hope her recovery goes smooth and she’s back in time to compete in London (and NY if she joins the race) since as a competitor I am really looking forward to seeing her.

If she’s able to get back in time, I’ll be cheering her on.

But since she’s going to be a mother, she’ll probably end up not participating anyway since the baby will be born at the end of May.

So we can all agree that this will just be a photo instead.

And that’s fine! We’re all just glad to see Nemeth back home (both physically and psychologically), I’m sure 🙂

The first one is the official announcement from the Royal Parks (the organisation that is responsible of all the parks, gardens and green areas in the British capital) and London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games.

The second one, from @AthleticsUK, is their statement. Let’s hope the situation is clarified soon and the issue is over.
