 trial since communism fell in 1989.

Romania has become an important test case in the fight against corruption. More than a dozen people have been sentenced to serve jail terms already. But the former prosecutors' case and the new one against Mr Ponta will put the judiciary's credibility in the spotlight.

Mr Ponta has said he was trying to reform and revitalise the public administration. But many of his own supporters said the timing was simply wrong.

Many in Romania believe the prosecutors are simply attacking the government to clear their own path towards the top job.

'They're putting me on trial by the people,' Mr Ponta said recently.

A campaign called #PontaMisa (Ponta the Scoundrel) was launched on social media to raise awareness of the accusations against him and a petition against his trial signed more than 11,000 people.

Mr Ponta's party won June's parliamentary elections, ending an uneasy political alliance centred on the government's alliance with President Klaus Iohannis.

And the government has so far kept in place a majority in the Senate, where parties have veto power.

Mr Ponta has previously described the prosecutors' accusations against him as politically motivated and a politically-inspired witch-hunt.

The new accusations add to pressure on the EU-supported government over its economic record.

The government recently put a price increase for electricity on ice after a series of protests over high pollution levels sparked by a public uproar.

But the government has faced accusations of economic mismanagement, including a tax-avoidance scandal involving a former government minister.

Romania is the poorest country in the EU, with about half of its nine million people living behind the EU's EU-defined poverty line.

It was the highest on Transparency International's corruption index last year. The report said Romanians ranked their president eighth out of 176 surveyed in terms of political corruption.
