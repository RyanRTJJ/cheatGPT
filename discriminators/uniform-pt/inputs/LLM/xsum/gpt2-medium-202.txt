 on a farm near Bristol in 2013.

'It's not the kind of person I would wish to go on,' he told the Bristol Post during an appearance.

'I have tried to put a positive spin on things in my life, such as not buying my girlfriend a plane ticket when she wanted to go to France because that isn't her world. It is just me.'

During the trial, Hardman, from Bristol, claimed he had taken his parents to Paris as well as his parents for a holiday.

Hardman had told the court that he was'so excited' because he had been to Paris for 'five years'.

Bristol Crown Court heard Hardman - from Easton - had visited France three times a year since his 16th birthday, but his mum Lucy claimed he only flew to Paris for short trips after he turned 16.

When he checked in at the airport before returning back to England for the trip, Hardman showed she had already paid for his flight - on July 22 2016.

He had told the court during the trial: 'I spent all my allowance at Luton Airport. I spent all of my allowance that was due me in July.

'My mum says that she paid $60 to go to France with me and it was just the two days before the trip to Paris, so there had been no money charged to me.

'There were two other days of travel too from Luton which weren't booked, I've only been in France for three days.

'After coming back she gave me an email saying it would be five dollars and told me to pay if I wanted a ticket to France so I just said yes, because now the other tickets to France weren't going to take me anywhere, I had to go to France.'

Hardman has been told he must pay a €3,000 fine unless he claims, within 14 days of his return, that there were no £5,000 in his account
