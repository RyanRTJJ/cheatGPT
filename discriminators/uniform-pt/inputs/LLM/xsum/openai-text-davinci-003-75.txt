 decide on January 19 on its next steps.

Dick Pound, former president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, said if the board fails to take action it risks its own integrity.

Idowu Akinwale, the chief executive of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria, said he hoped the board would take action.

"This is the time for Wada to prove the efficacy of its own business, the efficacy of the fight against doping. Nigeria has been found guilty and must face the consequences," he said.

"It would be wrong if they merely issue yet another warning, as they have done before. We've had that already and we are running out of patience."

Nigeria was given a two-month extension by Wada in October to complete its requirements for being declared compliant after being threatened with sanctions that could have included a ban from the Olympics.

The country has since been criticised by Wada for its slow progress.

The World Health Organization has also said it would not support a Nigerian anti-doping programme run by the government, citing concerns about the country's capability to manage it appropriately.

In December, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Nigeria from hosting all its activities until compliance is achieved.

It has also threatened to ban Nigerian athletes from international competition if the country fails to comply.

Nigeria is one of the most powerful African nations in athletics and won 12 medals - including three golds - at the 2016 Olympics.
