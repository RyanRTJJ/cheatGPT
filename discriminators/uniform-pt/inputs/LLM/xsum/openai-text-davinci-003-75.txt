 to tighten curbs on industrial action. Smith said that the Scottish government had failed in its duty to oppose the Trade Union Bill, and they needed to urgently step up their efforts to fight it.

The Scottish government recently voiced its opposition to the Trade Union Bill by writing to UK Ministers noting its "fundamental problems". However, Smith claims that the government needs to do more. He explained that the Scottish government should use its devolved powers, its voice in Westminster, and its influence over the public sector in Scotland to make sure that it is fighting the bill. He added that they should also look at how they can work with the Scottish trade unions and the wider trade union movement to influence the outcome of the Bill.
