On the Hearts website they mention they have a free-to-play website which is great news – this means you don't need a membership to play – but they offer a lot more for the ticket price. If you buy and use the £10 game ticket (£12 for adults) after the game day kick-off you'll get access to online payment options and the first ever live coverage of the game. They'll also stream the match for everyone in Scotland, so you can follow the action online before or after the match. With so many ways to watch this match, I think it should sell out, so pay quick if you want to watch this.

The move has been criticised as a significant jump in fees that would result in clubs losing out on potential income from TV deals.


However, it's worth noting that there's not a real benefit for clubs who are in the Championship, League Two and one of the six "old" divisions from the move, as clubs in the Championship would still pay out the Championship promotion fee for each season, while in the old divisions they would get that amount for their division from the
