The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) has revised its 2019 and 2020 GDP forecasts for Australia, citing slowing business conditions amid weakening conditions in the global economy.

The ACCI now expects GDP growth of 2.4% in 2019 and 2.5% in 2020, down from the 2.7% and 2.9% forecasts it made in February. The group also identified slower population growth and a lack of investment in key infrastructure projects as major factors impacting the economy.

"ACCI’s latest forecast reflects slowing business conditions in the domestic economy, due to poorer conditions in some key export markets,” James Pearson, ACCI’s CEO, said in a statement.

He added that the "forecast is consistent with a picture of weaker than expected domestic and global economic growth".

The ACCI said the Australian economy would need to be "agile" and "innovative" to counter the impact of global weakness and stressed the importance of fiscal and structural reforms to drive productivity and jobs growth.

The ACCI's forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are in line with the Australian government's most recent GDP projections. The government expects GDP growth of 2.75% for 2019-20, with growth slowing to 2.5% in 2020-21. It also believes unemployment will remain at around 5.25% over the next two years.
