Some of the vile images on one of the hard drives showed the genitals of a young person with a large penis. Mr Bell said these were pictures that he, in his right mind, would not have possessed.

In order to try and get the best deal for himself, he claimed he only had the drives, he had not been searching child abuse images on the internet, and the worst stuff on the drives had been downloaded in September 2007.

Jurors heard how Mr Bell met the women on internet message boards and how he would share his child exploitation material as well as other criminal information with them.

He denied two of the charges against him. The men of the jury found him guilty of the charges he did not contest.

A post-sentence report was ordered and he will be sentenced next Thursday.

We just wanted to tell you that we are really disappointed in Stephen Bell.

His actions have shown you that he is a liar.

He has claimed to be clean.

He is a coward.

He has shown no remorse for trying to hurt and humiliate countless victims by using his computer.

This has been, and will continue to be used in the court.

He has shown that he is a coward by fighting against the allegations.

I feel sorry for him too now as if he is going to be released he has lost a father, brother and friend.

We know that you don't think like me, but if you could spare the time, please visit his websites and send messages to his site to let him know this and what his parents, siblings and friends think of him.

The site can be found on www.stewartbell.co.uk where it is said that he is now a father of 3 children and a husband.

His actions are totally out of character for a 29 year old ex police worker, who helped save people, yet we are disappointed...

He has admitted downloading
