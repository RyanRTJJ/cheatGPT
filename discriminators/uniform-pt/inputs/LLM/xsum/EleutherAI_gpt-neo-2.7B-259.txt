 found people, on average, want people and things in life to be happier.

For men, a particularly large appetite was for people and things being happier; for women, a large appetite was for people and things being a little happier.

These preferences were strongest in early adolescence, with happiness preferences being greatest in 13-year-old boys and slightly smaller for 14-year-old girls.

But as these preferences evolved into a preference for being "a little bit happier" towards the end of adolescence, women's preferences evolved much more slowly.

"We wanted to see whether our childhood happiness had a measurable impact on people's desire for people and things to be a little bit happier," said co-author and University of Chicago psychologist Jonathan Haidt, who has devoted his life to exploring the importance of what he calls our "altruistic" motivations.

"We found that children and adolescents are more interested in happiness than we'd ever imagined," Haidt said.

The results came from a survey of more than 50,000 people in 18 countries with the largest study of human happiness ever conducted.

In their paper, published in the September issue of the journal Emotion, the team described how their survey revealed children as young as one year old spontaneously spontaneously expressed, in various languages, the desire for happiness:

"We would have been surprised if we'd discovered that children were simply having fun and making faces while playing. Instead, we found that their emotional experiences were more complex and included expressions of happiness."

While some participants gave more detail about their happiness preferences than others, it was clear that these desires reflected a well-developed and deeply felt desire for happiness in general:

"We wanted to understand the origins of childhood happiness, how it developed over time and how happiness affects our lives. Children didn't seem to know they were happier than adults."

The researchers found that children and adolescents desire more happiness than they express in their lives-perhaps because they are more open and honest about their feelings and more willing to talk about their happiness with others.

Haidt says the study provides a rare glimpse into how early childhood emotional experiences might help explain the development of the concept of happiness.
