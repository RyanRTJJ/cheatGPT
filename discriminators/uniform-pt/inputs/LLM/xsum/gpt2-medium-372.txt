 he had not known Penallin was the man he says they had been together but would "let others know the truth". An old friend of Penallin said Penallin's actions had been "troubling" but he seemed "reliable" and "professional", and never threatened anyone.

The incident happened on April 17 last year and a relative of Penallin, who was not named by The Courier Mail, said they were friends, often cycling to work on motorcycles on the side of their homes. It is understood Penallin was walking his two-year-old daughter in his car before the attack in the town of East Brisbane, south of Melbourne, when he ran across Lockyer who pulled into the opposite side lane.

A police spokeswoman said Lockyer was shot dead "with no injury" at 11.10am, about five minutes into the incident, and Lockyer's mother, Patricia Lockyer, 41, had arrived at the scene in a public ambulance at 11.53am with her son. Penallin was found after he had been stabbed 10 minutes earlier with a kitchen knife.

Lockyer's brother, Darren Lockyer, said: "I've only heard the names of the girls that have been killed and I think people would assume that it's the two that was killed." He described a violent relationship Penallin had with Lockyer and said Penallin's girlfriend from a previous relationship had been his partner in Australia: "She was his girlfriend for a long while," he said. Penallin, from a rural home in the town of East, told the ABC his life had been turned upside down in recent weeks.

"I don't remember the rest of my life, I don't remember having relationships with either of those women, which is really awful. What's worse is that Penallin did everything right. He went to universities and didn't get laid as he had his own problems.
