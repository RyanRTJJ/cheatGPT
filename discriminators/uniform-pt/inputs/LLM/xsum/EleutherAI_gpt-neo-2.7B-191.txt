 Workers Union announced that there are more than half a million workers who are paid more for safety training than London Underground workers. But the RMT, already a long-standing foe of the Mayor’s Transport for London (TfL) scheme which will use public money to train a large part of the London Underground workforce, has not agreed to take part in the campaign.

“There is no reason for public funding of TfL to continue on a year-round basis. With an all-out industrial action we could get all unions to recognise that. The RMT have never called such action. This is an open plan to create a company-company within TfL. It’s the worst possible union and we need an alternative.” A report in the Morning Star newspaper also claims that Mr Khan was speaking to “the left wing of the Labour Party”.

“The workers’ union is part, alongside the British Transport Pensioners’ Union and the Trades Union Congress, a front in an anti-public-sector campaign,” said Neil James, director of public transport for London. “The idea that people who can’t afford a union will be represented by one is a disgrace.”

The RMT say they have been ignored in their attempts to halt the TfL contract, which would save TfL millions of pounds in overpaid training costs. But, although it is not part of the RMT, there is evidence of a move towards taking over the TfL system.

“The TfL contract will continue under management of London Underground. It is not a TfL project. It is management of London Underground.
” “The London Underground contract with TfL has always been a private-public arrangement, because the financial arrangements were at a point so that they could be closed. But the contract is now a success,” added Richard Dixon, a spokesperson for TfL.

Mr James said that the TfL contract was “very different from a TfL franchise”. He added that the scheme would save the company millions
