 clinical standards and guidelines and would continue to work with the Department for Health to improve the free service for patients. "There is no specific clinical reason for this change but we are consulting with the Department of Health on how to best implement this change."

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: "We welcome the NHS Choices review, which has identified our health service as providing good value for money.

"We have been clear since May that the NHS should be able to continue paying for clinical services that do not meet quality standards."

Last year, the NHS was fined more than £1m for failing to meet national standards for care for elderly patients.

The Department of Health said it did not believe all hospitals in central England were currently complying with the guidance.

In May this year it fined the City and Becket NHS Foundation Trust, which run three of the three hospitals in central England including Ipswich Hospital, £917,000 for failing to meet the government's Care Quality Commission guidelines.

The DfE also fined Ipswich NHS Foundation Trust for failing to provide a fair service to carers, who are often frail elderly people living alone or who do less well with dementia.

According to the figures seen by the Guardian, carers were paid £12.9million for the care they provided to 1.4million patients last year.

A large proportion of patients attending the £10m-a-year hospitals in central London, the £2.7bn NHS in Hampshire and the £3bn NHS Trusts in Kent and Hertfordshire also receive care.

As a result, the cost of the care of the carers is estimated to be among the highest in the NHS.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he felt "relieved" by the move. "The key message is that carers are the most cost-effective form of healthcare that the NHS can provide. It is vital that they are funded properly and that services remain sustainable," Hunt's spokesperson said.
