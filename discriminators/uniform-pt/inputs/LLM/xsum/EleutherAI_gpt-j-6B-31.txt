 the next few years is a relief, I can go and watch and not worry about how he is playing", said Nando.

"Andy's a lovely guy, but he's never played well against me on hard courts", added Djokovic. "He is a great champion".

"He has been a legend since he started playing when he was at school, he won Wimbledon as a 17-year-old, when I was only 15", Federer said.

"I do not need that".

"Everyone has these good matches that they want to win, and I know he wants it, I know Federer wants it - well, Federer is used to these match-ups, and I am not", Djokovic said with a laugh. Federer, who turned 40 in June, has won the Australian Open twice in the past, which is why he is playing at Queen's Club instead of at the Australian Open this week.

"He's a great person, someone I really enjoy playing", said Djokovic. "I have been lucky, I am still playing well but it has never been easy to win the title against him, so it is always a challenge".

"I am really proud to play him at the Queen's Club, but it's true, it's a bit unusual", Federer said.

"We used to, but now we are good friends". He has won a set off Federer seven times, including at his last final at the US Open in 2005.

This year, Djokovic won the Australian Open, Indian Wells, Miami, the French Open, and Wimbledon, while Federer fell at both the US Open and the clay-court season.

The two had played a total 16 matches from 2011-2017, with Djokovic winning 16 times but only winning six of those matches on hard courts.

"It's been great to play him a few times at this level. You always look forward to playing, but it's always against someone you see on TV".

"He had some good matches with Tsonga, Ferrer, Benneteau and Benneteau, but now Federer is the No.
