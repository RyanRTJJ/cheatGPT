t, which was opposed by residents in some of the areas fed through by the route.

Monmouth MP David Davies has expressed anger that Velothon Wales organizers have lied to him about the level of support for the event from UK MPs. Daiwes claims that Velothon organizers told him that multiple MPs had backed the event, when in reality, only a handful of MPs had expressed any direct support. The MP has strongly voiced his disapproval of the event, which will see around 15,000 cyclists participating on a route which goes through some of the most picturesque countryside in Wales.

Davies has urged the Welsh government to reconsider their decision to back Velothon Wales, and ensure that any such event does not occur on public roads in the future. He has also highlighted the disruption to the residents who live along the route, many of whom feel that the event has not been planned in an appropriate manner. The MP is calling for the Welsh government to listen to their complaints.
