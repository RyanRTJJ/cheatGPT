 income tax without holding a referendum, as part of new legislation that came into effect in April 2019. 

Local authorities have the power to raise council tax and non-domestic rates, but the power to increase income tax requires legislators to back a statutory order. This allows orders to be made to set an additional income tax rate in an area, should local authorities choose to do so.

Renfrewshire and Inverclyde decided to increase their basic rate of tax by 3p in order to fund increased spending in their areas, while South Lanarkshire opted for a 2p rise in order to help fund a new climate change fund. The Edinburgh Council voted to become the fourth local authority in Scotland to use the new power, with the additional income tax providing funds for education, healthcare, and other initiatives. 

It is expected that other local authorities in Scotland will follow suit in the coming years. 

The process of setting a new income tax rate is simple. First, a local authority must decide on the tax rate to be applied and then make a motion to the Scottish Parliament. The motion must be approved by a majority of the members of the Parliament, before the statutory order can be approved. Once approved, the new rate is effective and local taxpayers begin to pay the new rate retroactively, where the backdated amount will appear on the next tax bill.

The new income tax rate has been warmly welcomed by the citizens of Edinburgh and other local authorities in Scotland. It provides localised taxation where the revenue generated can be channelled towards projects that directly benefit the local population. This, in turn, helps them to thrive and flourish, in turn helping to improve the wider economy of Scotland.
