 Langmead was at the store, where she told the police that she could not find a toilet seat in the store, police were told. She added that she and her two siblings and others had called 999 after Ms Bowers allegedly took off the shoes. The two were taken to police in Northhampton, and they await arrest.

Police said they had previously contacted the family but were yet to find a toilet seat. She said she had to leave after the incident after she was put in hospital by a doctor.

Kaya Langmead, 25, and her siblings, 19 and 17-year-old Jasim, 29, were arrested on suspicion of causing the incident.

Her brother Alton said: "I was on the phone with Kaya, but no one from the kids knew what happened – it's devastating and the kids need it. "They've taken an extremely hard look at my body."

Mrs Langmead has said her daughter called police on her phone to report on how she had taken off the pair's shoes. "She was crying, crying. " I just thought something was wrong, like we got lost there and all this stuff is happening now."

The pair have not been placed at a foster home.

The pair are due for sentencing on August 4.

The South Yorkshire Police Service said: "Our men who responded after receiving a call at the mall said they saw Kaya going to McDonald's in the McDonalds to get more food.

"She later returned home to take more food to school of her own, which was where the incident took place."
