 in recent weeks, has moved on under pressure from investors in recent years after it took over the sale of a bank to Anglo Group.

The company's chief executive, John Tait, said there were "very serious political issues" that must be negotiated over the next few years, and that he was also keen to be heard. He denied that the company itself had come under fire when a reporter was hacked or even had a breach of security.

"There has been a series of media reports about a group called ENO and it is something that would need to be resolved. The company had recently made many very significant changes," Mr Tait is quoted as saying on Facebook.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who also is due to meet with Mr Tait in Ottawa on Thursday, is expected to urge an executive in London to speak out about the allegations. Mr Morneau previously told the Guardian he had not been given the authority to speak publicly about money in foreign accounts.

The controversy over Enbridge's role has dogged the company during a series of moves from Mr Marois's government over the last year.

As recently as late September, Mr Tait dismissed allegations the government was preparing to cut back on subsidies to energy companies, arguing the government's proposed cap on net investment was already in place and the decision from an executive had not changed. Mr Marois was quick to defend the government on Twitter, saying the company was working with ENO, which he argued had the right to share financial data with governments.

"All EIA documents have gone. We have a responsibility to Canadians to ensure that we don't give the public more information about our investment decisions," he said last month. Mr Marois last month told members of the House of Commons the EIA has not been involved in Enbridge's actions publicly or publicly.

EIA has denied that it uses "highly confidential information with the expectation that it might not be leaked or exploited because of the sensitivity of the information we provide", but some have described it as such.
