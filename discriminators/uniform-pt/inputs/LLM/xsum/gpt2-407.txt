 400 years ago after he was buried at St John's Hospital. It seems as though the skeleton found beneath the hospital was probably buried on a large wooden table, meaning the skeleton wasn't in a position to leave a footprint, as could have been.

"There was only one part of it that was missing, and from there on we have seen lots of clues. And from those clues we can reconstruct if there was one specific area of the skeleton, but we know that was probably a relatively small area," said co-author Jonathan Goldbohm.

A number of other key links have been established. "We don't necessarily think that it was a very large area. It could have had a bed of some sort, to make sure the bones really didn't have to be moved up and down."

"But we do think it was on the sides, possibly with some of the soft material, rather than with that of a head or body part and in very short, extremely large spaces."

In the case of this skeleton, the remains may have been taken by the same person who gave them to scientists in the 1960s when they uncovered the University of Melbourne's new campus which used to be a school of mathematics and science. Another theory is that the bones might have come from an older friend â€“ another Sydney University researcher Dr Robert Shemby.

"There certainly is hope that some of us have got this sort of 'we haven't even figured out' piece," Weil said. "And there will likely be more theories. But it won't be our only case."

The team plan to examine more bone from every site with more of them to try to reconstruct the body parts. This next expedition will also examine the bones and find out more about potential burial sites.
