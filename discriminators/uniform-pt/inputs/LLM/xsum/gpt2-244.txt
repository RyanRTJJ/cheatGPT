Mrs May faces fierce pressure from her own party to leave the European Union as she grapples with an array of pressing policy issues, including a call for a renegotiation of the EU's single market.

The Tories have said they will back the government's Brexit pledge if it is included as part of the government manifesto and she looks for the strongest party among their peers in parliament after their election victory on 8 December.

However, the government's campaign has been dogged by questions over the timing and nature of its announcement.

The prime minister will make a speech in Brussels on Monday afternoon at around 7pm. It is likely to focus on some EU issues, particularly over the timing of Brexit.

It will also set out a series of steps the government will take to avoid chaos in Brexit negotiations next month. The speech marks the latest in a series of ministers to launch a renewed campaign against the Tories following the election win, and will mark her first visit to Brussels since she took the lead in the campaign.

While her visit will be welcomed by all sides of the government, Eurosceptics fear it will undermine Mrs May's support for her Tory challenger David Eads. After announcing plans to scrap Article 50 of the EU single market after the Brexit talks in May, Brexit proponents have warned the prime minister that it has become impossible for her to remain prime minister.
