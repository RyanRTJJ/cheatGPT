He said that the purpose of the test was to "demonstrate technical prowess in the defence research and to create a sense of identity in our national defence".

The test comes amid growing tensions with the West over Iran's nuclear programme.

In October, the International Atomic Energy Agency accused Iran of failing to abide by new limits on its nuclear programme that had been put in place as part of a nuclear agreement.

Iran's government said on Monday, after a weekend of high tensions, that it was "ready to be a victim of nuclear terrorism" after it appeared that an Israeli satellite-launching rocket may have exploded before launch.

Israel has rarely officially acknowledged carrying out airstrikes against Iranian targets inside neighbouring Syria. But last month, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, threatened that anyone who launched a missile at Israel would face a "very heavy price".

Iran's government maintains that its nuclear programme is for civilian rather than military use. Israel, it says, wants to wipe out Iran's nuclear technology with an atomic bomb, a position fiercely denied by the Jewish state.

US forces conducted a similar missile launch last month from a US-held base in Iraq.

But the Pentagon also later said that all missiles had misfired, with Washington calling it a "technical mishap".

An earlier version of this story was updated to correct in the 6th paragraph that the launch was not from the USS Boxer

Nuclear deal dispute

Tehran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, rejected "any Israeli threat" to Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, after a satellite-launch rocket appeared to have exploded before launch on Monday in Syria's eastern Golan Heights, Iran's Fars news agency reported.

In remarks carried by state TV, Mr Araghchi said the satellite launch was "in line with our plans", adding that Iran had "no intention of causing insecurity" abroad.
