ll cash machine withdrawals are fivers and their regular use is at its highest for a decade.

The Fiver for Britain campaign was started in 2018 by members of the public, anti-poverty groups and retailers, to get banks to stock more fivers into their ATMs. At the time, only one in ten cash machine withdrawals were £5 notes and their usage had fallen to a 10-year low.

The campaign generated national press coverage and more than 200,000 people signed a petition calling on banks to make the five-pound notes more readily available. Banks responded by responding to the demand: cash machine loading rates rose significantly, with the amount of £5 notes increased by more than 500 percent.

The initiative has been praised as a success, as it has made it easier for people in the UK to access smaller denomination notes, which is particularly important for those on lower incomes who may have limited access to more valuable notes. 

In addition, the campaign has also been credited with leading to a reduction in the amount of plastic waste from ATMs, as fivers are one of the least likely to be withdrawn in large quantities or used for foreign or online purchases. 

Finally, the Fiver for Britain campaign has succeeded in reversing the long-term decline of small banknote usage, demonstrating the power of collective action to influence change. It shows that, with public support, even relatively small changes can have big impacts on financial inclusion and access to cash in an increasingly cashless society.
