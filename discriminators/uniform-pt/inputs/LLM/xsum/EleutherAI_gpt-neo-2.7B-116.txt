'A public relations disaster'

Citizens Advice, who previously said it would not help cyclists who had gone to Velothon Wales, has now confirmed it will offer free legal help.

The agency's director of campaigns, Dr John Wilson-Clarke, said: "With many of the world's most famous sporting events, you'd be forgiven if you believed that bike riding isn't a particularly dangerous activity.

He urged people to report all bad behaviour to Crime Stoppers and get police involved.

Last year the agency issued a "blue card" warning to motorists over speed traps and suggested setting speed limits
