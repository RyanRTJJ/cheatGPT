arkshire, the Isle of Shetland, the River Forth, and the River Clyde. It is also a site from which to gain information about the locations of the battlefields as well as a database of battlefield maps from across the world.

There is an optional feature called The Great Battles Database, containing information about a total of 2,000 locations. This can be accessed from the start of the game and contains useful historical information.

Contents

The Battles Database is a database of maps, battlefields, and military tactics for all battles in The Battles of Glencoe, as well as a database of battlefield maps from around the world, based on historical sources. It contains information about historic engagements from the early part of the First and Second Centuries, along with further information on contemporary battles, such as aerial photography and topographical surveys, and includes a section on the Battle of the Aisle of Roses which documents the Battle of Culloden.

If the player wishes to view additional locations within the Database, including that of a specific location within a battle, they must first travel to the map that they wish to view, speak to the Historian in the Tavern in Tarth (Lion Inn), and then locate the required battle field. This can be done by pressing the "D" key, choosing the map and then selecting the battle field in which they wish to view.

Upon completing the battle field that they wish to view, the player is rewarded with a map marker in the area of their choosing. The location itself is also noted in the battle's database for the next time the player enters the battle field. As the battle continues, subsequent entries in the Database will tell the player about the results of their battle against the enemy.

History

Background

Glencoe occurs sometime between the 6th and 13th centuries, around the point that Britain is known as the land of the Picts.[4] It is not clear where the battle originated, but it is most likely that it was fought near the site of what is today the Royal Armouries in Glasgow.[5]

The name "Glencoe" comes from three ancient French words meaning the "land of St. Glenna" (meaning "Holy Place"),[6]
