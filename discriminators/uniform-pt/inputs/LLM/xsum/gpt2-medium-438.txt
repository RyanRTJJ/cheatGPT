1bn there for the whole of 2014-15 – up from £1.3bn in 2012-13 and £1.1bn in 2013-14.

Visitors to Scotland made £2.2bn spending here, up 2.3%.

A further 1.76m people and 30,000 businesses came to Scotland from abroad, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That is the highest inflows for the number of visitors since 2007-08, when 4.34m came.

Tourism to the UK accounted for £1bn of Britain's total spending, up 2.3% on last year – although it is down from the 2013-14 period when £1.6bn of tourism was generated.

Travel to the UK from Ireland, whose economic fortunes are linked to tourism spending, topped out at nearly £100m in 2014-15. Visitors made around £18.8bn from Ireland's economy.

The number of visitors from Germany grew 2%.

The share of Germans visiting Scotland grew to 26.8% from 24.3%, the ONS said. Tourism to Scotland from other EU countries rose on average 3.2%, while France attracted tourists from 10.5% to 16.9%, and Italy grew 2.2%, it said.

Travellers to Northern Ireland, where the First Minister met with the new devolution minister, Peter Robinson, for talks on 8 March, recorded their ninth consecutive year with a net gain.

The tourism sector is expected to contribute 6.7% of GDP from 2016-17 to the country's economy. Tourists also made up the sixth-largest source of the UK's government welfare receipts in the year to the end of March 2016, the ONS said.

The ONS said: "While the ONS does not know how many of these travellers would be in Scotland when the new devolution settlement comes into effect in January 2017 it does know that, in the past month, 1.7m visitors have come from outside the UK."
