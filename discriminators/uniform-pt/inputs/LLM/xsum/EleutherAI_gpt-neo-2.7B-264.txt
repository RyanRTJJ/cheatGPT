bn. That is well above the 3% to 4% cut in spending that was intended, although the new figure is in line with growth in the last three quarters.

On Tuesday this week the Treasury said £23.5bn of reductions will be required to realise the £2.4bn cut in government spending expected in the 2012 budget. To hit this figure a combination of belt tightening (cutting tax credits, benefit spending and pensions) and borrowing will be needed. The government is already £1 trillion in deficit, and this is about to get worse. To get away from deficit it will need additional borrowings and tax rises or cuts. It will need help from the Bank of England, but this will have to come from more tax rises, not less.

The other major issue is the long-term fiscal issues in which the government is having difficulties - it will need to borrow more, in particular to support the interest payments on the existing debt. In January 2011 Osborne talked of 'dodgy' financial assets, and in April of this year he claimed that in'some sectors' some companies and governments were 'willing to hold back payment of all current, past, and future tax in order to take advantage of lower statutory tax rates, potentially using a tax shelter'. He also claimed that some sectors, such as oil, were 'dodging and scraping' paying their full tax liabilities.

But there was actually very little dodgy about the way that firms or governments used tax shelters - just the extent to which some were prepared to do so. We all knew they were dodgy because of the way that the government was going about its tax cuts. They went to the G20 in Toronto and made promises to cut income tax while cutting corporation tax only to give it back if we followed their example in the UK.

Osborne was criticised at the time but the damage was contained to one small area in which the Liberal Democrats were in government, Northern Rock, or were planning to be.
