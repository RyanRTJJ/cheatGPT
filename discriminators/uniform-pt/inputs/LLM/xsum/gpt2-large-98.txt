. The jury heard several hours of testimony this week before sentencing.

Bailey was shot to death on the job two years ago. That case was never tried, so he will be buried next to his daughter.

He and his wife, Christine, were expecting twins when he was killed in 2007. She left behind five children.

"I just want to say thank you to everybody who cared for my family," Bailey said at the sentencing. "I would like to thank the community, to my family, to this law enforcement department, to all the people who stood next to me and cheered me up every day."

Bailey's mother, who was sentenced Wednesday, told the court the two-year ordeal has traumatized her.

"I was never the same after that morning … we really have to make that night … special," she told the court.

Pascoe said prosecutors could have charged Bailey for assault and murder were they not convinced the officer committed premeditated murder.

Combs, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, testified that he believed Bailey had turned toward him, pointing a loaded 9 mm semiautomatic handgun at him.

He said he tried to disarm Bailey.

"I could not see that he didn't have a gun. … I could not tell he did not have a weapon," Combs said.

Tribal Chief Jerry Blevins said Combs did not make a sudden movement during the shooting. Bailey had not moved a muscle, and Combs believed he was moving slowly, Blevins testified.

Combs is currently on unpaid administrative leave.

Bailey was the second Eutawville officer to be killed in the line of duty. Deputy Keith A. Deutsch — who shot and killed an armed robbery suspect in 2007 — was cleared of murder in that case in 2009.

Bailey was shot shortly before 5 p.m. on April 30, 2007, after his pickup truck backed into someone driving a vehicle pulling a school bus.

Bailey's wife was inside the vehicle when the incident happened. Her 7-month-old daughter, Bernard Bailey, was in the back seat, unable to be reached by police.
