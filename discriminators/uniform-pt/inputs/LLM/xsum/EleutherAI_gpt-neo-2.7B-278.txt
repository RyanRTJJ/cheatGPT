2 million in a year the figures showed, up 2.9 percentage points compared to the previous year.

In Northern Ireland, there were around 542,000 total registrations this year, a rise of 42.3 percentage points on the previous year, whilst in Wales this showed a rise of 43.8 percentage points over the previous year, on a similar percentage rise in the UK.

Scotland was also a top ten nation this year, and at 1046, was only one percent further away from the UK's 1066 registration position.

Other top tier regions' registrations were in Northern Ireland - 543,000 registrations this year from 2016 registrations, and in London, which took the seventh position with a rise of 52.8 percentage points.
