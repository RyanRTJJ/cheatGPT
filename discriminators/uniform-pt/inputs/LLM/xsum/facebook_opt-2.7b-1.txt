 and “playlists for every mood”. There was even a feature that lets you shuffle your music. Unfortunately there was no option to turn off the ads.

Google has since released a “Play Music Ads Free” version which does away with the in-app advertising. It also includes some features such as Google Play Store and Google Play Books but you’ll have to pay to access Google Play Music.

Unfortunately for Android users, Google Play Books is only available on iOS for now and there is no date on when it will be coming to Android.

A Google spokesperson confirmed reports that the two apps will be completely identical on Android. However, Google Play Music will be in beta, so there is a chance the features you get in beta may not make it to the final Android version of Play Music.

A Google spokesperson explained that the service will include all the features as part of Play Music Premium but be made free for users who pay for the service. They didn’t comment on what other types of in-app purchases are planned.

Google has always offered Play Music as part of Google’s YouTube Red service but wanted to give consumers an option on whether or not they wanted to pay.

The announcement comes as Google is slowly shutting down Play Music. The app was discontinued in 2017 for Android so this is likely the same story for iOS users who currently have the paid version of Play Music. It will probably be replaced with Google Play Music that has ads.

Update 2:27PM: Google has officially confirmed the decision.

“We will begin gradually discontinuing the free Play Music app in the US and Canada on October 29, 2017. We recognize the Play Music app has been in the market for several years and our goal is to remove barriers that prevent consumers from starting with Spotify if they don’t already have their Google Play music account.
