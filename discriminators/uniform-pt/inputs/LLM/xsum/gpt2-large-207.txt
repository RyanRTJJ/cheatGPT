The man stabbed is said to be from north-west England and the alleged plot allegedly led from London. No date has yet been set.

The plot was reportedly devised in an effort to provoke a military response to the US-led campaign against the Isis terrorist group in the Middle East in Iraq and Syria.

A source told the Mail on Sunday: "The plot was hatched by one of the three men. The other two men were not involved in the planning."

A third man, named only as Ali, 27, of Walthamstow, north-east London, also allegedly conspired to murder Mr Khan.

Mr Khan's son, Sam, 23, an IT consultant, was reported to the police by another person in October.

The family was "shocked and saddened" at his death, his wife, Sajida, told the Mirror earlier this month.

"Sam has been in a critical condition since the morning we became aware of his condition as he was not well," the couple said in a statement released through the Metropolitan Police charity Crimestoppers.

"Sam is such a good kid and has always been so strong in the past but sadly I feel that he has not had a support network.

"Sam is a good, bright, caring person with a brilliant future ahead of him and we want to offer our full and unconditional support to him, his family and his friends in this difficult time."

Detectives believe the plot arose when a couple returned from a wedding in Kuwait for a visit and were approached by someone outside the hotel who identified himself as a member of Isis.

The group of four men were given a "hit list" of people to target or kill at random while it was still unknown who the actual killer was, the Mail on Sunday reported.

They reportedly decided to kill Mr Khan, who was a devout Muslim, by killing him in a series of assaults over several days.

Police believe all the men involved may be under
