"They were in no position to make such an audacious statement without a clear sense of the costs," Jhong was quoted as saying.

The company is also facing charges for making a "high volume" of illegal drugs, including cocaine, ecstasy and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the late 1990s.

In May, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission charged several of its biggest players with two offences, both with possessing more than 100 kilograms (320 pounds) of illegal drugs for sale.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) later brought two related suits against Jhong, but at a hearing on Friday the judge ordered it to pay $15m in compensation.

Mr Jhang, who had been a member of the ASIC Board of Directors for five years, resigned from the board on Thursday.

Jhong is a company spokesman.

He is due to appeal against the ruling.

He has a daughter, the granddaughter and his daughter-in-law.

His daughter, a daughter-in-law, and a nephew who are also a member of the board, were among the six individuals who was accused of producing and selling the illegal drugs.

The ASIC was ordered to pay $30m but the company did not deny any wrongdoing.

However, a spokesman for Jhong indicated the ASIC could appeal in the coming weeks.

Jhang has been charged with five of the five offences - producing and selling illegal drugs, failing to deliver the drugs and failing to register to operate as a legitimate business.

He is also facing up to 10 years in jail after handing down an 11.5 per cent conviction sentence in January.
