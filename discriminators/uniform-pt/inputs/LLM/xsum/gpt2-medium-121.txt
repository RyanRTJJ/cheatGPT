 believes some of the uptick stems from the increase in sexual partners among the patients with AIDS in areas with less medical resources, including in areas of high drug demand, such as the southeastern Philippines, where about two-thirds of patients contracted the disease in 2011.

People often get better on their own and they tend to forget that," said Ester Lu, chief of PHE's National Center on AIDS Promotion and Prevention. "We are not denying that. We are just trying to understand that [that] there is a connection there. It has to do with the disease itself."

"But we need to educate them in a safe and supportive environment, to have an environment in which patients can learn to behave better so they can live a more stable life. "We believe we can help our patients live a happier and healthier lifetime."

PHE is urging all AIDS patients in need to seek medical care outside those "safer" areas if they are on low incomes because of the shortage of qualified doctors.

PhE has already launched a program to enroll a "community care team," comprised of people who are trained to help with home care, which it hopes will help to increase the number of patients on a monthly basis. This effort is still being evaluated, but the goal is to establish "pharmacy clinics with an emphasis on home health care," said Lu. PHE is still waiting for results of a final study to determine the benefits of using the initiative to reduce waiting times.
