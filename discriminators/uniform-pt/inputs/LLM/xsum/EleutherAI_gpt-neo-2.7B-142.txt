Watson, who has reached the final eight of 24 Grand Slam finals, was handed the first set in straight sets before forcing a tiebreak, taking the second before the crowd erupted.

She was a break up in the set before a forehand-shot return in the blink of an eye beat her opponent to take a 7-6(4) 6-4 6-2 win in just 31 minutes.

The 26-year-old British wild card from the United States, who was the top seed in the US for the first time at this major, never looked like making a mistake on a surface where she has yet to lose, taking the final set 7-5 on the back of a remarkable turnaround.

Watson's second-day opponent Sara Errani had also never before played a match on clay, having lost her debut to Madison Keys 6-2 in the first round of Wimbledon last year.

Errani, who is world number 20, had two chances in the first set but also failed to take the next, only to force a break of serve in the eighth game, before sealing a break of serve to take the set in just over a hour.
