 allow online sales at all, but customers were able to opt for a Â£10 savings after just 24 hours of being signed up; now in that case customers need to put the promo code into their shopping basket before shopping.

But customers still have a few hurdles to jump through. The store has made an effort to encourage repeat customers, which in turn can have a beneficial impact on its turnover, but it will take users who have already seen an item and have no intention of buying it again to make the change.

There are a few exceptions to this rule, of course. It is only possible to switch out your shoes in an in store shop, and those orders cannot be made without taking your order out, and any goods that would normally go to the foot of the seat won't be available, even if you've booked online.

There are further exceptions for smaller items or items for which a fee is added to the order and the buyer has to bring it on board. Customers can still pay by paypal for this service though, with the shop staff accepting a credit or a debit card payment.

It gets worse. If anyone with a current account can afford a phone and a modem, they can potentially order something online which could damage their device if it gets stolen.
