, head coach of RGC, had said “The pitch is a little bit slower and they have a few more big men than us which is unusual but I’m sure we will get a good test.”

The hosts started well, going down 6-3 to RGC. Merthyr went on the offensive and scored five times in the second half to win 32-22 against RGC on Saturday.

There was a lot of excitement at the start of this match as the players were treated to the rare occasion of an evening game.

“This was a great atmosphere and the players seemed to enjoy it,” said Dr Samuel. “It was a big relief to see one of our players score the first try of the game,” said Dr Samuel. “It gave players like Mark Evans confidence.”

Dr Samuel was very pleased with the performance of his team and said: “Everyone had a great attitude. We knew the team playing the opposition, RGC, was good and it was a good challenge for us. We have a big squad and a lot of depth and we expect good things from the squad this season. We have a lot of players who can do things for the team and will be useful.”

Mark Evans also had a great performance.

“I saw this game as an opportunity to improve my individual game,” said Evans. “I was delighted to score my first try of the season,” Evans added. “The quality of rugby RGC play is impressive. They have quality players in all positions, and I am sure we saw the best of them today.”

Despite the win, Dr Samuel said: “I don’t think we played to our full potential and we can play a little better next week [away at Porthcawl]. In the first half especially, we were very sloppy with some of our passes. For instance, I thought we were sloppy when passing the ball at a kick-off as we were trying to pass under the feet of the opposition. We have another week to work on it.”

RGC had an 18-0 lead at half time
