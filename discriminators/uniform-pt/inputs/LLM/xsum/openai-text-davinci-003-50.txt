f holiday go unused annually, which suggests that employers must be flexible with requests as they cannot be guaranteed that staff will take all of their contractual days off anyway. In addition, employers must ensure that all requests are treated fairly, which includes ensuring that employees who have taken time off for dependents or for compassionate reasons in the past are not treated differently than those who have not.

In practical terms, employers should ensure they provide accurate and up-to-date information about holiday allowance and access, and should keep a system of records to track how requests have been handled. Employers should be aware of their legal requirements with regards to holidays and pay entitlements and adhere to those. Employers should review their policy periodically to protect their staff against discrimination and to ensure fair treatment of holiday requests. Furthermore, employers should try to be as flexible as possible when it comes to arranging holiday times, while still keeping within the bounds of the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Working Time Regulation 1998.
