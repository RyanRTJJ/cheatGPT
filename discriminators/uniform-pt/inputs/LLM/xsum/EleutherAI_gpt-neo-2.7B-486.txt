 in the WTOâ€™s history."

The United States, which uses steel and aluminum from countries such as Brazil and India to make aircraft and other products, is opposing protection given to American exports, saying that a ban would impose serious trade penalties.

Trump has warned that trade could cause recession, with the US-brokered agreement likely to increase corporate profits, and that he wants a deal to be fair to both parties.

"There shouldn't be a country that has the ability to sell us more than is competitive... and we leave them to sell us the way we want," US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said during negotiations in Argentina last week.

"If we have a free and fair trade area, it would be a disaster for our country," he said on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund.

US Chamber of Commerce president Tom Donohue said China is likely to make a counterstatiion. In an interview with the Associated Press, he said Trump is "using the WTO to do his political campaigning", and said the deal may help China make a counterclaim.

But the US is the largest foreign supplier of the aluminum and steel used in Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and is a big player in the global market for both.

The company has also agreed to add 1.3 million extra jobs in the US and Mexico, increase Boeing's investment in the US and expand production here.

The 787 is an all-metal plane, meaning there is no cockpit door where mechanical components are stored, unlike an aircraft such as the Boeing 767, for which both the fuselage and tail are made of aluminum.

That allows Boeing to recycle scrap aluminium from 787s that would otherwise have to be scrapped or destroyed, and makes it much more environmentally friendly.

China is one of only two countries that accounts for more than half of all 787 parts supplied for the US and can prevent Boeing from exporting them to other countries even
