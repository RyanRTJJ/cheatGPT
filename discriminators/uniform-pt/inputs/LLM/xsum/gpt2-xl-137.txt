 forces took her to a police station in Glasgow, but denied she was detained.

McGarry was one of a number of demonstrators arrested after they blocked a main road in Glasgow on Monday. A number of people were also arrested as they tried to get around the police barricade near Govanhill station.

One officer was injured after his foot was caught between a metal fence and the protesters.

Last month a woman died after being struck by a car being used to block a road in Glasgow. Police said one of their officers was killed, while two others were injured. Police have told the Guardian that no one has been arrested in connection with the incident.

David McIlveen, an environmental lawyer, was among the first to be arrested at the protest action in Glasgow. He said he had been a founding member of Greenpeace Scotland earlier in his career. "It feels very much like home," he said.

Several of the activists arrested in Glasgow were released from custody a short time later – but the protests continued elsewhere in the country on Monday.

The Scottish and UK governments have failed to put any serious proposal on the table to address climate change despite a sharp drop in the price of oil since June amid the fallout of major oil spills in North America and the Arctic.

On Sunday, oil companies BP, ExxonMobil, Shell and Total announced that they would invest over £25bn in the renewable energy sector over the next five years – but failed to reveal how they would achieve that investment.

Mick Antonius of Friends of the Earth Scotland said the protest action was to be "a significant moment for these activists", adding: "We think this is a call for a new kind of politics, for people to say this is a new way of using your government's powers – it's not what they give you to use them on, by voting them out and voting them in."
