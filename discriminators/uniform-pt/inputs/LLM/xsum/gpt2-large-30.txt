acey Felt described her as "quite the person, she wasn't just some child that had gone missing. She had become a monster".

Police believe Elsas and another teenage girl were found dead in a house in Gogbourne, Essex, on 9 November with severe head injuries due to beatings with a hammer that was used by one or more of them. All the girls had been sexually abused.

In a major breakthrough in the hunt for Elsas, the Independent Police Complaints Commission last month ruled police had been guilty of racial discrimination in the inquiry into the murders. Following the announcement, chief constable Peter Spindler launched an inquiry into the case.

In his annual meeting of the police and crime commissioner last week, Spindler pledged Â£30m of new funding for the investigations on the murder investigation and the police handling of child sex abuse inquiries. He also announced that he would appoint a "chief resilience officer" to support officers involved in such cases.

The police response was condemned by the child abuse charity Liberty. "Police officers who ignore child abuse will not find it in themselves to protect vulnerable children," said its head of policy, Clive Lloyd.

The Metropolitan police said that while the new chief constable would bring new powers to the force, "overall investigations will go on as before".

The force's annual report said: "While the new chief constable is likely to represent a significant change within the force, it is far more likely that he will have little impact on the way in which the MPS investigations are carried out."

Satisfaction is running at 66 per cent at the end of last year, the highest in the UK.

As well as new recruitment, the number of officers being sent to South Yorkshire had risen from 12 last year to 17.

Sporadic shootings in South Yorkshire last week in which a young man died from a single blast are expected to affect the force's perception of an "overwhelming threat"
