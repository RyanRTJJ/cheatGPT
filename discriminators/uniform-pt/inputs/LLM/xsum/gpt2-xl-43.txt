 noted that there was no sign of an explosive device.

Israeli military spokesman Peter Lerner earlier said "a number of rocket" launches from Gaza were intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system.

Palestinian officials in Cairo and Gaza, which Hamas says struck an Israeli army officer on Friday, had no confirmation, but other Hamas sources accused Israel of launching an attack on the U.N. shelter. The Israeli statement did not name the officer but said he was "personally involved in planning terrorism against civilians."

Israel's military claimed to have hit several sites in Gaza overnight Friday, but the IDF did not mention civilian casualties. It has confirmed that at least two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli attack. Hamas later said three civilians had been killed, including one woman, but it gave no other details.

UNRWA says more than 500 people have been displaced after the raid and it appealed to Israel to ease restrictions on the movement of people. The agency also condemned Friday's "terrorist" attack.

In an email to U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson accused Hamas of "directing" the assault on the Israeli post, but did not mention any casualties in the hospital.

"We hold Hamas responsible for all attacks carried out by the armed groups, including by targeting United Nations employees and facilities and the safety of civilians," he said.

A spokesman for the United Nations, Farhan Haq, called on Israel to allow international agency staff, including many Americans, "to evacuate the U.N.R.W. building without delay or restriction, and to allow the evacuation of all other personnel under their care."

On Friday morning, several hundred people demonstrated at U.N. headquarters, briefly shutting down roads in an effort to get in front of the building and in solidarity with the injured.

The Israeli attack comes after days of tension between the U.S.-backed Palestinian leadership and Fatah, the dominant faction in Hamas' rival Palestinian Authority.

Palestinian Authority officials have complained to their U.S. counterparts about Israeli attacks last week in the northern West Bank
