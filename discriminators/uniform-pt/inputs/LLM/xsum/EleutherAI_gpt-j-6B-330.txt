 service sector rose to a near a nine-month high.

The reading was up at its sharpest in almost a year while a gauge of business confidence rose to a near 18-month high.

The Bank raised its forecasts for both the British economy and the UK budget borrowing requirement in the next 12 months.

It said both economies needed to be on an even keel, and added that the latest figures suggest the Bank could be able meet its forecasts.

The report said that even though the service sector is growing, inflationary pressures remained "well contained".

It said the "fairer weather" had not yet translated into an increase in employment.

On current policies the Bank said there was limited room for interest rate cuts.

The Bank has kept interest rates at their record-low of 0.5% since June 2009, because of the financial crisis and the impact of the Eurozone debt crisis.

Its forecasts for the British economy and the British budget borrowing requirement have been unchanged.

The survey, from a total of 42 industry groups, found that the services sector expanded while the manufacturing sector picked up.

There was a surprise fall in both production and output while prices increased at a slower pace.

The Bank raised its forecast for exports to grow by 2.7% next year, up from 2.5% for this year.

Robust growth

It also predicted the UK economy would grow by 1.7% next year, up from 1.6% for this year, which would see the economy return to a pre-GFC level of growth.

Economists had been expecting a 0.2% contraction next year.

Economists had also expected a rise in unemployment from 8.8% in this year to 9.4% next year.

The report found that the fall in output and prices was "mostly driven by the weak global economy", with no change expected in the prices paid by manufacturers.

The Bank said the inflation rate remained "well contained", adding that it expected it to "gradually rise" after the impact of the winter weather eased next
