 Mr Corbyn didn't turn up to any votes in his Aberconwy seat during his five years on the devolved assembly.

Ms Evans said the question of Mr Corbyn's expenses had been looked at "several times" by MPs, adding: "It is the case that there are very strict rules around expenses.

"I think people who take their responsibilities seriously should be expected to accept that that's what they need to do.

"We are all human beings and we all have responsibilities to our constituents and to our colleagues."

Labour's Mr Corbyn has previously admitted to paying some of the £70,000 to buy the flat, as well as receiving a £2,235 mortgage.

The London Labour candidate said the rules should have applied to everyone, despite the controversy he has faced over his decision to take up the taxpayer-funded accommodation.

In 2010 he bought the flat in Tulse Hill, south London, and moved into it a year later.

He is still in possession of the flat and is paying the mortgage as it was not in his name.

Mr Corbyn's spokeswoman, Monica Watson, said the MP had paid fair market rent.

She said: "John is paying the full fair market rent for his London home.

"The cost of the flat is £1,700 a month and John pays around £250 for the gas and electricity.

"He also pays rent to the former MP for the period that the flat was his."

"It is true that MPs pay for property when they are not in the House," Ms Evans said. "But they do have to fill a gap when they are away."

She said the costs of the flat - around £8,250 a year - should be added to expenses.

She added: "John's flat should have been a local office with a tiny staff and that staff should have been paid appropriately for their level of work."
