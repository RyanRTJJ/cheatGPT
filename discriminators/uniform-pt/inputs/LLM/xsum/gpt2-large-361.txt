 dated 18 December by Treasury officials.

"In light of the strong financial situation the Dail has entered into, we are asking the Cabinet to consider the possibility of the introduction of additional reserves for the interim period," he said.

But he denied he had made the proposal to the Taoiseach and insisted it was "not a request for extra reserves and I have no idea where this has come from."

"If the budget was to be changed we would not want the additional reserves, even though I think they can be beneficial if needed," Mr Robinson told the Dáil. He said he was a fan of the idea of using the additional funding.

He also confirmed the funding should be increased for emergency services "in any event".

Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, he added: "What this funding is for, it's going into emergency services that the Dáil is spending on."

Mr Robinson said he would not be making a political statement in relation to the Stormont executive.

However, he said he could not comment on the status of talks at Stormont because he was not being considered for that role.

He said he would not comment on the budget until negotiations were "close to a conclusion" but it was also going to be a "mess" so he "will try and keep my fingers crossed that we get a deal done".

The finance and public administration department announced late on Monday that it would extend all funding to Stormont's administrative agencies until the end of the month, so that there was no gap for the department to run for a further month. It said it wanted to ensure emergency services could continue for a further 45 weeks.

A spokesman for the department said Mr Robinson had personally contacted the Taoiseach regarding the funding issue.
