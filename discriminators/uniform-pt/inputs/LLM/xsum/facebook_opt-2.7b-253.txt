The company made the decision late and then withdrew it – a point we have always made in our court battle.

However, we won a High Court challenge for the full hearing, meaning North Yorkshire County Council’s decision on fracking at Wylfa was unlawful. The judgment was then upheld yesterday at a Court of Appeal hearing in London.

The Court also found that a public inquiry set up by the council was “too narrow in its scope”.

Friends of the Earth are now campaigning for a new public inquiry into fracking across the country to be held by the Government.

Friends of the Earth’s lawyer Caroline Lucas said:

"The Government is duty-bound to look closely at the huge environmental and public health risks of fracking.”

Fracking campaigners have been out and about in the run up to the election with a series of rallies against the extraction of shale gas in England.

They say fracking is bad for our environment, threatens our food supplies and is dangerous; while also saying the extraction of shale gas from shale is not economically viable.

Yesterday, the fracking industry said the ruling meant fracking would be allowed by the Government despite fracking in the UK being “uneconomic for the country”.

The industry said it wanted to frack “as a matter of urgency” but stressed it was a long-term industry.
