 paratroopers opened fire on their protests against the controversial Northern Ireland civil rights movement.

After meeting victims and families they marched through the city centre carrying banners saying "This was our fight, and it is your fight" and "The state is not above the law."

Speaking at the demonstration, Ms Lamont said: "I was born here in Derry and as a child my dad taught me to value my freedom; freedom from fear and the tyranny of my rulers. "All I ever wanted was to have that freedom restored for the children who will follow in our footsteps."

Ms Lamont said the people of Northern Ireland needed more than just an apology to be able to live together once again. She said: "They want a better life, we want a better life together. Those families are hoping to get out of here alive and a lot remains to be done to rebuild the social and political infrastructure that has been destroyed.

"There's much that needs to be done to deliver equality, fairness and integrity to the administration in the North, to restore the rule of law and protect the rights and freedoms of all."

Lord Saville QC, who conducted the Bloody Sunday inquiry for the Government, said the families and the public needed to be reassured there was genuine change in a new, inclusive political and institutional structure for Northern Ireland.

He said: "The government and indeed the families, all need to be reassured that any changes that take place in the future are going to be genuine, are not just superficial."

Lord Saville said there had to be changes that allowed the Northern Ireland peace process, including constitutional reform, to be achieved. He said: "That's the time when we have to decide whether we want to move at speed or slowly; that's the time for me to really show what my work as a lawyer is about."

The Lord Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Sir John Saunders, and the British High Commissioner to the North, Anne Anderson, were also at the marchers' rally.
