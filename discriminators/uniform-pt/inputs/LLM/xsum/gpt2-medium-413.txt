 wrongdoing.

Derek Scurlock, Mr Bailey's legal adviser, said the family was confident Mr Bailey's evidence was truthful and compelling.

In a statement, Sinn Féin spokesperson Pearse Doherty said police were right in arresting a man for assaulting a woman and arresting her without a warrant because he was carrying a large quantity of cocaine, methamphetamine and other drugs.

The court heard Mr Bailey had been arrested by gardaí at a home in Derry on February 7 last year, where he had just arrived when he attempted to steal $2,500 (£1,770) from the cashier, who held him down and put him in an apparent chokehold. However, a witness heard Mr Bailey say that the woman had not been armed with a gun.

After making some initial enquiries the Irish Police Association said a search warrant which was issued by the Chief Commissioner would have been issued without consent and then "disappeared".

Two members of the Garda Senior Sergeant team were called in to assist with the situation and the following day gardaí seized eight grams of cocaine and one gram of methamphetamine. After the search, gardaí arrested Mr Bailey with the help of the National Drug Squad, and two people from the Garda's Major Crime Unit were arrested, one of them carrying a large quantity of drugs for processing.

Mr Bailey argued the search of his house was illegal because the police had acted before him, and the search was carried out despite being prohibited by the "search warrant".
