, for example because the taste buds on the tongue react differently to different shapes and sizes. Colour, microstructure and the presence of aroma compounds can also affect the flavour of a cheese.

In terms of cheese, size has an influence on the texture of the cheese. Harder cheeses usually tend to be smaller in size, as they are more difficult to cut into larger sizes; softer cheeses can be cut into larger pieces without losing their texture.

Weight also has some influence on texture, as heavier cheeses are usually creamier and denser than cheese that is lighter in weight. 

Shape affects flavour in two ways. Firstly, cheese that has been cut into a specific shape, such as cubes or slices, will have a different flavour profile to cheese that has been grated or crumbled. Secondly, the shape of the pieces affects the surface area of the cheese and thus the amount of flavour it imparts.

The colour of the cheese can also affect flavour. The yellow colours of tradition cheddars indicate a higher level of carotenoid content, which gives the cheese its characteristic nutty flavour. Blue cheeses, meanwhile, owe their intense flavours to production processes that involve mould spores, which give blue cheese its characteristic taste.

Finally, the presence of aroma compounds can also affect the flavour of cheese. These volatile compounds evaporate upon contact with air and give cheese a characteristic flavour.
