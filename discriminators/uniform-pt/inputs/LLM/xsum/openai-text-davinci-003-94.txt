he youth denies murdering 33-year-old James Attfield and 31-year-old Nahid Almanea in Colchester, Essex, in 2014.

The court heard that in the early hours of 27 March 2014, the defendant, 17 at the time, stalked the then 33-year-old victim, James Attfield, through Colchester's Castle Park. Importantly, he was wearing clothes wholly identical to what witnesses described the attacker had been wearing when Mr Attfield was stabbed 102 times.

The prosecution counsel then listed out a litany of offences that the youth is alleged to have committed on that night in March 2014, including the unlawful and malicious wounding of a third victim, who had stayed in the park and witnessed the incident.

The prosecution claims that the defendant, who was armed with a large kitchen knife, inflicted grievous bodily harm on Mr Attfield.

So as to avoid doubt, the prosecution explained this occurred at the same time as he chased and confronted Nahid Almanea and stabbed her 61 times with a different knife, which was later recovered from the scene.

The youth's defence says that he cannot be identified for legal reasons, but the prosecution says he has a criminal record and matches the description provided by witnesses at both scenes.

The trial continues.
