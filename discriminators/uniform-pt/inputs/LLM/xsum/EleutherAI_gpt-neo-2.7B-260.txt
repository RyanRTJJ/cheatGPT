 law in October to ensure food labelling with graphic photos when it introduced mandatory packaging measures to help consumers make informed decisions in a bid to drive the number of eating disorders in the country down.

The move by the Health Minister, Simon Harris, has already caused controversy in the wider Irish public.

The Irish Independent has been contacted by members of the farming and animal welfare communities at work in the country who have suggested that the graphic photo is misleading and may even constitute a breach of the European Union’s trade sanctions.

The graphic images on packets have already caused problems for consumers across the Atlantic because of the graphic language of a number of the warning labels on the packets.

This included “Caution for sensitive stomach, bowel and urinary tract” and “Not for children under 8”.

Such language, which has caused an outcry when seen on British products, caused a row last month between New York and Belfast, with one Ulster Unionist saying the Irish Government has “been using the Irish public as a guinea pig for testing health labelling to see if it conforms to UK public health requirements.”

But the Minister for Health, Harris, has also indicated support for the law, arguing that Ireland may need to “go further” if it wants to tackle the health epidemic.

When asked whether the warning labels were to blame for the rise in eating disorders in the country, Harris said that he would be “happy to look at them … if we did find that they’re causing problems… But I don’t think so. It seems to be on the other side”.

Meanwhile, Ireland’s Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Phil Hogan, has said the new measures do not need a change in EU law.

Speaking to the BBC, he said that despite the EU’s ban on the use of animal products in its own legislation, it can allow member states the power to make food labels less strict.

“It is a common law principle within Europe that food manufacturers are allowed to make the product as they wish,” he said.
