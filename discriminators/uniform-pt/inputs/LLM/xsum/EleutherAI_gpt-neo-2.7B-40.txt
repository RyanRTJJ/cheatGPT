 while it may raise tensions under fire from charities and campaigners, there are also good opportunities.

We asked the UK's leading police forces whether, as things stand, they are sufficiently supported by heritage crime units when faced with heritage theft?

1. CID officers (Criminal Investigation Department) and anti-social behaviour teams have been responsible for stopping, searching and prosecuting up to 1,000 people each weekday since May 2002. In the last 12 months they have uncovered a network of crime lords and organised crime groups that have been moving huge amounts of money and drugs both overseas and within the UK.

2. The Crown Prosecution Service has long considered the issue of historical theft to be outside its remit. However, as crime levels rocket in the wake of 9/11, the CPS is setting a higher benchmark for historical crime in its own definition:

"The CPS' definition of historical theft from the past refers to the theft of records belonging to historical, heritage or historic archives or archives held in central and local government collections. It is based on law, and therefore it applies to the theft of the contents only, and not to the artefacts which have not been stored."

3. The Home Office has also expressed concern about historical theft, and says it is aware of the problem. However, the Home Office's current guidance on historic crime suggests that the best approach is for police forces to support local heritage unit teams in their investigations.

4. But as we have reported, a new policy has taken effect in March 2012, giving all CID departments the power to issue warrants to seize the assets of historical criminals. So, while there is no doubt that the number of police officers investigating for historic crime in England and Wales has doubled since May 2002, if historic crime leads in future prove to be just as effective as local historical crime teams,
