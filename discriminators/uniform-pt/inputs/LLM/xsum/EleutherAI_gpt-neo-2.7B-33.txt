"The investigation into Mr. Gray's death, conducted by special prosecutors, showed that Mr. Gray died of cardiac arrest as the result of his severe spinal cord injury due to police abuse," Mosby said. "His condition was irreversible. However, the manner of his death is subject to a legal challenge which is pending.... The case will remain a homicide investigation."

The Gray family has repeatedly said they hope the case will never be cleared and that, if they are cleared, the city should pay all their expenses and damages.

Gray left North Carolina on May 9 for a routine trip to Alabama, where he'd planned to meet with his father. But after being stopped at a sheriff's office for driving with cracked window glass, he was thrown out of the car, and police allegedly punched him in the face as he lay on the ground. Then Gray was put in a van and taken to jail.

He was booked on an old battery charge with an estimated $200 fine and released in one hour, prosecutors say. Hours later, in a violent incident that left him in a coma, Gray was arrested on suspicion of resisting arrest. That led to the alleged police attack, and while being beaten, he is alleged to have begun to bite the officers involved in the attack.

Hours later, he was still on the ground and handcuffed by authorities when he suffered his fatal spinal cord injury. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead 10 days later.

The charges could keep Gray's family and attorney from receiving any of the $33.5 million in damages that they have consistently demanded. The city, meanwhile, would owe more than $30 million in legal fees to pay Gray's family for defending against the allegations against the officers.

The $75 million settlement announced three weeks after Gray's death came at the cost of a loss of moral clarity, lawyers for both sides said,
