 also admitted drink driving in November 2015 and admitted possession of an offensive weapon and the unlawful use of a weapon in relation to the weapon found at Grafton Close in December 2015.

Mr Mills was killed in a crash on the N4. Ms MacSherry caused serious harm while the second driver also suffered serious harm and injuries in the crash.

Ms MacSherry was sentenced to six months jail.

She was jailed for 29 months in relation to the dangerous driving charge and 15 months in relation to the drink driving.

She also was placed on a 12 month extended supervision order.

Solicitor Mark Trombino told South Wales crown court that Mrs MacSherry was a widow and mother of one and a grandmother of nine at the time of the crash.

"Although she said she had suffered some physical injuries, she said in mitigation to the charge she was simply a young widow in a terrible accident," Mr Trombino said.

"She had made this trip, a long journey by car, for personal reasons and was therefore a vulnerable victim herself."

'The real culprit'

Mr Trombino said the impact of the crash on Mrs MacSherry was serious and she had suffered depression, anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder.

He said Mrs MacSherry had been drinking alcohol throughout that time.

Mr Trombino said the first drink driving charge Mrs MacSherry was acquitted of was after a trial, but the second drink driving charge was dismissed.

"This was a long way around and was undertaken as she was unable to see a solicitor," Mr Trombino told the court.

The barrister said Mrs MacSherry had been in custody since her trial.

He said both charges were dismissed on 10 May, which Mr Trombino said was coincidental.

"She was then given a six month jail sentence," Mr Trombino said.

"This was suspended on condition she completed a six month care order."

Mr Trombino said the care order was for two children, ages 14 and 13.
