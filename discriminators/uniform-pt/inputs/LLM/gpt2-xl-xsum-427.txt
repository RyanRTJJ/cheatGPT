 changes, including cutting taxes, strengthening the economy and investing more in infrastructure.

The Labour leader will say: "The truth is that too many of our children are worse off today than 10 years ago. A growing number of people do not have the standards of life we want them to have. There is a crisis in living standards. We know people getting by on less. There are too many families where just the essentials are not being met.

"That is why I want Labour to set out how we will meet the challenge:

1. A living wage is a decent living wage. And every household has been paid at least that in real terms for four years running.

"2. More investment in infrastructure. For people in work, to encourage more people into work. That means helping those who need it the most.

"3. Getting the fiscal balance back on track.

"4. Taking back control of welfare. And giving this Government what it does not deserve - the power to decide who gets the benefit of the tax and benefits system.

"5. Creating a fairer country for all our people. We don't believe it's fair that people in London earn a six per cent salary, but pay the lowest tax rate in the country. We don't believe it is right that the average house in a middle class neighbourhood costs more than the average house on a council estate in a country town.

"6. A government that helps to create jobs. That means making the UK an attractive place to work. We want to see a new growth plan which ensures every area of our country has the skills they need to succeed.

"7. Building a stronger economy for all. Because we have to make the real difference to build a better life for the next generation. A fairer, healthier country for all."

Mr Miliband is also set to call for a change of approach on Europe and argue that Britain will "probably" have to remain in the European Union if the Conservatives continue to oppose membership.
