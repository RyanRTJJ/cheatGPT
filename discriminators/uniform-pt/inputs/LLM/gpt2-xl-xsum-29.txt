a year ago with the help of the Indian government and was trying to open a small clothing shop in the neighbourhood when the bullets struck him, police said.

The shooter, believed to be in his 20s, fled the scene. The victims, who worked as drivers for an interior design company in Karachi, were taken to hospital, some of them in critical condition, where they were receiving treatment.

Witnesses said one of the gunmen shouted slogans against the government and politicians.

According to police, a "hate crime" had already been registered against the gunman.

The incident took place before dawn on Friday in an area of the district home to several foreign embassies that is located in a narrow alley known as the "pashtun belt" of neighbourhoods lined with small shops specializing in clothing.

Pakistan's ambassador to India, Husain Haqqani, condemned the shooting as "a senseless and cowardly crime" that he described as a war crime. "I convey to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the government, my government, all parties, to come out strongly and clearly against such a heinous crime," he told a press conference in New Delhi.

Shops selling sports and fashion items are an important part of neighbourhood life in Karachi, where traffic, businesses and residential areas are jammed with people from all over the country.

"The pashtun belt is a safe place because no one really knows where they are from. The fear factor here in the city is very high so it's hard to get by here," said Sufyan Hussain, a 27-year-old employee of a local fashion and jewellery shop who works in the city's upscale Sher-e-Kashmir Market.

"We all know when someone has no problem with the neighbourhood or country and they choose, they choose to kill people. It's sad. This city does not belong to the bad people," said Hussain.

Maulana Akonjee, the victim of the shooting, described how he opened his shop for business a few months ago. "I will be buried next week," he told reporters in Karachi.
