 saying it had to protect national interest.

While the letter did not name Mr Abe, it appeared to focus on Japanese steel companies.

BBC business editor Robert Peston said the letter was "certainly not that clear" because it "didn't name the specific entities or companies" who could lose their tariffs, only the tariff-free trade.

The row over steel is the latest issue to flare up between Japan and the UK, which says it will not pay for the nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point C because it does not have a contract to run it.

The government and the company involved in building the plant, EDF, say Hinkley C must go ahead before a final investment decision can be taken.

The row has become so damaging that UK trade secretary Liam Fox visited Japan last week to warn EDF to start work on the plant urgently or he would pull support for future British nuclear energy projects, as a result of what he said was a "highly worrying" stance held by Japanese authorities.

I wonder why Mr Abe would send his letter to the UK trade secretary, rather than just say to Mr Clark exactly what he wanted. I'm told that a few ministers were worried he may not have understood the situation.

Japan's decision to withdraw Japanese state aid for Hinkley Point C is yet another reminder of the huge political and economic stakes involved in the UK's decision on nuclear power.

This latest row comes at a sensitive time for Britain, with Brexit negotiations under way and the government just saying it will not pay for Hinkley's electricity - a pledge that effectively shuts the door to a deal with the EU.

What's more, the UK's decision on the Hinkley deal has put the future of all other big public contracts with Chinese companies in serious doubt - such as China World Nuclear Power.
