 were expected.

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, speaking from Brisbane on Wednesday, said the incident took place on a commercial vessel, not a military vessel, and that crew members had done their best to rescue the missing.

"We know that the people on the boat had lost faith in a rescue," Mr Turnbull said, adding that Australian officials are assisting the Indonesian navy.

Indonesian officials have said a total of 36 Sri Lankan fishermen were on the boat when it was intercepted, raising the estimate of the casualties to about 100. The Australian military has declined to release the figures but a Sri Lankan government official said the number was likely to be between 20 and 40.

Australia is providing a Royal Australian Navy (RAN) P3 Orion surveillance aircraft on its way to assist with the search, saying there are around 30 crew on board with specialist skills, including maritime search and rescue officers, as well as a diving team.

"There are some of our most skilled and experienced personnel aboard our P3 Orion aircraft assisting with the search and rescue efforts and are actively engaged in the effort to locate the missing and dead," Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman Angus Houston said. "Our priority continues to be to support Indonesia with their search mission and we offer our assistance on this priority basis."

A senior Indonesian military officer told the state-run National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission on Tuesday the crew were detained and had been questioned by local authorities.

"I've spoken to the officials from the military who have arrived at the scene. They didn't say how many passengers [were on board] but there were 36 Sri Lankans [on board]. The people who wanted to leave had no money so they had to bring the money from their countries," the officer, who asked for anonymity, told the commission. "The security of the crew and the rest is still under investigation but they are very much in the dark."

The ship was reportedly heading home to Batam, a remote island in Indonesia's Maluku island chain, when it was intercepted by the Indonesian navy on its way from the Sunda Straits to the Indonesian resort of Nusa Kambangan.
