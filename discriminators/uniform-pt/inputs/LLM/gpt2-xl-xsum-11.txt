the ground floor who also pay a premium have not had their fees increased whilst the club's staff pay no fees, despite the fact that they remain in the house.
Here's my take. I've already been a long standing supporter of The Hoops for many years, and even though I'm on the ground floor, this is an important issue that needs to be addressed before the season starts. The Hoops have a long standing habit of overcharging the rent money of the community surrounding them. These charges often amount to £600 – £700 a year. In my view, this is wrong, as the club has a duty to the people of this area to pay the lowest possible rental price for the land. I've been offered free tickets to the away games in future to protest, so we are hoping there is a change soon.
