The doll was put on show at the National Museum for People with Mobility in Leicestershire yesterday.

The museum's director, Julie Pacey, said: "It's a very moving experience, but for me I think it's also a reminder of how far we've come. We've made a very big step forward. It's important that we can show people that these days we can have a doll in one hand, a car in the other and a motorbike."

A spokesman for Dezeen said the magazine had contacted the National Lottery to arrange a viewing for the doll and would pass on details to anyone who was interested.

Dezeen contacted Action Man's maker to arrange a photo shoot and the magazine arranged for four of its photographers to accompany volunteers on Sunday to record a video with the doll before it was transported south. Dezeen said Action Man had "stunned" people when it was first unveiled at the National Museum to the cheers of children.

Action Man was one of a handful of original Action Men produced for sale during 1964 while the inventor also designed the famous Action Man robot that appeared in the James Bond film Dr No.

He designed the toy specifically to aid young users recovering after accidents and became a national success. Action Man became popular with wheelchair users and the design was later adopted by other manufacturers such as Mattel.

The original prototype for Action Man in 1962 cost about £1,500, but was widely considered to be a flop and so Action Man was made more cheaply and simplified for production.

Action Man was sold as a stand alone doll and was priced at £2,700. It was also sold by Mattel and others who produced similar, but different versions, including some for children and one for disabled people.

In addition to wheelchair users Action Man also had four side wheels and a motorbike and a car. It would be exhibited at
