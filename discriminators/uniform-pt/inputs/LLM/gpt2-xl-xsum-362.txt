 were told four years ago by doctors that if she took drugs to control her seizures, they would eventually kill her.

"If I didn't have our medication I believe they would have found me on the floor next to mum," Sophia's mother Helen said. "It was very scary to go to sleep at night."

Sophia's story is a growing one across Northern Ireland and is set to be presented on the BBC's Children in Need series.

Helen Gibbons, who has two sons with epilepsy, was one of the campaigners behind campaign group Dravet Syndrome Action.

She helped persuade the Northern Ireland Department for Health to ensure that people with the condition receive the support they need, such as a prescription for Apertension.

People with Dravet Syndrome usually develop seizures when they are around 2 years old.

The BBC series starts this Sunday on BBC One at 20:30 GMT.
