 from patients or their families and not the hospital. This is particularly important when the hospital considers an individual patient's welfare before any other hospital interests. The information that journalists receive is confidential and is given to the patient or their family. The information provided in this report does not in any way compromise the security of a patient or their family"

The report was based on interviews with men and women who had sustained serious injuries in Israeli military incursions, either at home or at hospitals, as well as their lawyers.

"My family did make me choose a hospital. They took me there first – at the hospital my family is the most important thing to me," said 25-year-old Mahmoud Jaber, now recovering from amputations and two other limbs. "Afterward the army took me to the Ramallah district… and I spent three months there. I can't talk about it. This is my private life."

A 27-year-old man, Ahmad al-Kassel, with a head injury, from Deir Istiya said, "I cannot talk about my injuries here. But I'm here now, and I'm a little better."

The testimonies in this report are the first that provide the public with a clear and detailed picture of Palestinian casualties from the same violence that Israeli soldiers use to prosecute Palestinians.

"The number of men and women injured following clashes is huge and these men and women do not deserve to die," said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director. "They have no connection to the violence that Palestinians endure, and no power over it. Journalists should not be complicit in the slaughter, neither should the institutions that stand to benefit from violence against Palestinian civilians."

"The majority of these patients we interviewed have not yet been heard from, denied family visitations or were denied medical care. Many of them also have the right to life, dignity and respect."

This report, which includes interviews with Palestinians under the age of 18 from Gaza, West Bank and Israel, is part of an in-depth investigation examining the Israeli military's response to Palestinian deaths in 2014. In August 2014 Israeli forces killed over a dozen protesters and three bystanders at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound during demonstrations against Israeli occupation.
