bn, as compared with the 2008 level. The figures for 2014 to 2020 should be taken with a pinch of salt, given the economic climate which makes growth somewhat more uncertain. And the growth trend since 2001 has been an annualized rate, with the UK's economic performance at more or less a standstill. Even so, the figures still seem strong. Even at the start of that time, Britain would have produced a bigger GDP than most of the other developed countries considered with an economic model that was based on growth plus constant population.

What really makes Britain unusual is that it has been able to grow at such high rate. The last time the UK was capable of even close to its current growth rate was in the 1960s, when inflation was low and growth steady. If it wasn't for rising oil prices and other factors, Britain's average GDP per head in the 1970s would have been higher – which would imply that other advanced economies had indeed caught up. But it wasn't. And most major countries will not even get close.

Now, the UK's GDP per head, measured by purchasing power parity, is higher than that of its biggest competitor, Japan, which is doing worse than the UK. This fact has long given the UK a competitive advantage, but in recent times, it has been more than offset by the higher rate of consumer debt and the higher growth in government spending. The UK's average GDP of £66,000 was the highest in the G7 for 2001 to 2011. But for 2012, its GDP per head was almost £30,000, which was still 10% higher than the GDP of the next biggest competitor, the USA.

The US continues to grow its gross domestic product (GDP) at a slower pace, but it is still one of the most competitive economies in the world. The UK is a little bit below, with output growth in the economy last year of just 0.5%, compared with 1.5% for Japan, 3% for Germany and
