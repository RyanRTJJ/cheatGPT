______________________________________________ The Last Man I have always been on a quest to find my place in the world. I have been travelling for nearly eight years, and have so far failed in every attempt. I have traveled to other planets, but always ended up back on earth. ______________________________________________ The King of the Desert I didn't expect much when I got my first letter, but I opened it hoping for some kind of information. Nothing happened. Nothing. Just a box of random junk. I tore into the first thing I saw. It was a map. I tore off the map as fast I could, but I didn't have enough time to read it. I knew I needed to get back to the city. So I started my journey back. When I heard the screams, I knew I had to escape. I picked up a sword in the city, and began my journey. Soon I began to hear the sound of children yelling, and the sound of dying people. My curiosity was now so powerful that I knew I only would have to wait until the day I had to cross a bridge. The king of the desert is dead. He was killed by a child. I heard the sound of children screaming. I took a sword and cut down every other child. When the children died, they turned into sand. They started walking and begging for me to take them back to the desert. I said no. The sand began to get warmer. The children began to die of hypothermia. I couldn't take them. I could see the world as it was in the eyes of the children, and the children saw the world as they were in the eyes of their children. ______________________________________________ The Bookhouse Boy I'd written a story in my bedroom years ago. The story is about a boy named Jack Harper, so named because he lived in a bookhouse, for a book. His life in a bookhouse would be strange for anyone to stay, but I knew that the bookhouse would make Jack happy. I wrote the story for Jack. He died when I was twelve, when I ran away from the city to find the world outside
