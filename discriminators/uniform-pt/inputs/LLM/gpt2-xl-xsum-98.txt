. "I think the verdict speaks for itself," he said. "There was enough evidence to convict him."

In Combs' version, Bailey was going under the influence when he got the ticket. "The problem is it didn't quite pan out to be the case," said Combs.

Bailey's mother was visibly emotional as it was read that she would get $9 million in a civil lawsuit against the Police Department.

After the verdict had been read, the defense objected and the jury retired for deliberations. They deliberated over the next two days. After a three-week trial, they unanimously found Combs guilty and sentenced him to serve eight years in prison.

Combs would have been eligible for parole after six years.

Bailey's mother said, "For him not to go to prison is horrible. I never imagined that he could do this. This wasn't about anger or hatred towards the police. I just couldn't believe it. I couldn't forgive him."
