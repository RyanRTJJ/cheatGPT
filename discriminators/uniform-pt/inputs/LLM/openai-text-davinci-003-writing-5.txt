Once upon a time, there was a young professional who was looking for their dream job. They had diligently worked on their resume and cover letter, but felt something was missing. 

They decided to write a motivational letter to stand out among the dozens of other applicants. However, due to their lack of experience, they weren't sure what to include or how to best format the document. 

Although they had tried their best, it occurred to them that they needed an outside opinion. After searching online, they found a critique service that could help them. 

They sent their motivational letter to the service and awaited the results. A few days later, the feedback materialized; the experts provided helpful feedback on how to improve the document. 

In their critique, the professionals focused on the structure of the letter, providing a template for the applicant to use. Too, they highlighted areas that needed improvement and noted key points that should be included. 

The applicant was grateful for the feedback; after making the suggested changes, their motivational letter was free of typos and structurally strong. The young professional felt confident in applying for their dream job with the improved document. 

The moral of the story is to always seek outside opinions and constructive feedback when you need it. Your words are powerful; let someone else help make them shine!
