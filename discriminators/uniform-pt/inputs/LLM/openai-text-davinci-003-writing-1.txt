John had been planning this moment for weeks. He had long been tormented by his peers, stricken with depression and anxiety, he was ready to take his own life and take some of his tormentors with him. He entered the school building with a weapon in tow, determined to end his own misery before anyone else had the chance. 

It was then that he heard gunshots coming from his own classroom. Before he had the chance to act, he realized that the shooter was one of his classmates; a kid named Jack. While John was ready to end his own life, he was determined to make sure Jack was stopped first.

John cautiously opened the classroom door and snuck in, finding Jack reloading his firearm. He slowly crept up towards Jack, determined to tackle him to the ground and disarm him. But just as John was raising his arm to tackle him, Jack spotted him and a staredown ensued.

John had a brief moment of clarity. In that moment he understood that Jack was in the same position he was—a broken young person that felt their only option to escape their pain was through violence and death. John was ready to act in self-defence, but instead, he simply lowered his arm and asked Jack: “What are you doing here?”

Jack hesitated and finally, his gun clattered to the floor. Through tears and broken sentences he opened up to John, revealing his pain and feelings of isolation. John responded to him with understanding and compassion. He helped Jack to understand that he was not alone, and that there were other, better ways of dealing with his pain.

John then placed a call to emergency services and together, he and Jack were able to bring the violence to a peaceful end
