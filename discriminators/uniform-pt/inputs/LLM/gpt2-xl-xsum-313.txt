 a player who is comfortable at 10 and who is able to carry on through the game and help us to win the game," said head coach Vern Cotter.


"What I've seen of Conor's game is he is an impact player, he is an impact scrum-half. In those games when he has been on the pitch, we have got the better of teams. That is a real valuable trait for an international player."


Glasgow flanker George Ford will make his 50th international appearance on Saturday and he is the first player from Wales to join the Lions in the past six years.


"A lot has been made of his Test debut against South Africa in Durban last year," Cotter added. "It was obviously a big match but I took that game more from his performances than his number of caps."


Glasgow openside flanker Liam Henderson will make his 25th Lions appearance and he will feature against Fiji, having been rewarded with Scotland's No 2 jersey ahead of lock Al McFarland.


"I'm delighted," said prop Allan Dell. "I know the boys are excited to play against Georgia but what excites me is that Liam is selected in the side, we played him at halfback in the first Six Nations in Scotland and he looked very comfortable at that.


"He has got a good pedigree at Edinburgh and he knows a few guys around the camp and it will be an exciting opportunity for us to play Ireland and Fiji. I'm happy for him to be selected in the team."


Glasgow's match against the Samoans will be the first of the new Six Nations Championship and it is expected to be a one-sided affair given the two sides' records against each other.


The Lions' opening Test in Sydney against Australia is the sixth of the season which will be played across nine consecutive Tests.
