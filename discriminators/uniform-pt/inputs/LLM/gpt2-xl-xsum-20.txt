Ch Supt Clarke said: "This was a shocking case where police officers, who had been given a tip-off, were able to identify the children in a series of photographs – images of abuse, and there is no evidence to suggest these children were placed at risk in any way. These are simply images taken from the internet." Asked specifically about the fact that a number of the pictures in the original call remained online after Carruthers was tracked to the area, the officer said: "I wouldn't have thought so, but it may have occurred at a later date. It could have happened, it wouldn't have seemed a surprise".

Carruthers worked at the RUC HQ in Portadown where the abuse claims first came to light and was on duty on the night of June 15, 1996. After a police officer gave a call-back to a young person identified by Carruthers as one of the victims, he became involved. The abuse ended up with young male victims being interviewed by officers and their parents being visited. Carruthers was suspended before his arrest more than a year later.

It follows the arrest a fortnight ago of David McGough after five months on the run after admitting possessing extreme images which included the children being abused.

The abuse came to light after McGough was tracked down by his wife, who noticed a large number of pictures of abuse. The children the RUC inspector had worked with were shown many of the photos of abuse. She found it odd that she and his children had been involved.

Carruthers will be sentenced on 30 September. He was found guilty of abuse of a child under 13 – the same charge the RUC inspector pleaded guilty to. He was also found guilty of conspiracy to sexually assault child victims younger than 13.

His fellow RUC officer, Peter Connolly, 40, also from Portadown, was found not guilty of sexually assaulting a child, possessing extreme pornography and possession of extreme pornography with intent.
