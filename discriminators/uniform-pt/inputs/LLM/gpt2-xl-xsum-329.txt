The pair were on a trek organised by the Bradford Mountain Rescue Group (BMRG) when they fell.

Both fell from a summit called Lark. The two have suffered moderate injuries, but are all said to be in good spirits.

BMRG's Lynne Wood, who leads the group, said they had been searching for some time before the group went missing on Sunday.

Ms Wood, who lives in Sheffield, said: "We've been searching for the pair for the last few days and the weather has really disrupted our efforts. We're at the mercy of high winds and heavy rain.

"We got to Lark on Sunday morning and found some tracks on the summit and thought we'd go round and see what might be out there.

"The tracks made were a very steep, steep path and as we went round, they became more and more difficult to follow. Then we lost them.

"It took two hours to find them, and I'm really hoping they're okay.

"It's very rare for somebody to go missing on this mountain and we're extremely worried as we don't have any idea what happened."

The BMRG said the group were hiking on a relatively unknown route to reach the Lark peak by high-altitude foot.

They had been going for 13 days and planned to climb up the mountain this summer in order to get to Lark.

She told the Times: "The route isn't well known so many trekkers have been doing it over the last couple of years. It's a long way to go to get to it, and it's not known where the summit is exactly."

The pair are also thought to have been on a trip with a
