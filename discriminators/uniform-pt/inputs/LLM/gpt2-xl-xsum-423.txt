 50p a therm due to higher electricity costs at the UK National Grid. The tariffs are expected to rise further.

Fife Council said it opposed the merger as a threat to local jobs and the city.

The council said there was "now considerable concern at how the new company could be structured" and that if Fife was not prepared to sell its own shares it would have to negotiate a separate disposal.

Scott, an MEP for the Labour Party, said: "It's simply not good enough.

"I believe that it's about time we took stock of the situation in the electricity market, and that is the situation we have.

"I'm not a great fan of large business mergers or acquisitions, but we need to ensure that we maintain a strong energy market here in Scotland.

"This deal is not good enough, and I will do everything I can to block it through Scottish Parliament with a motion."

Scott's Labour party colleague, David Ross, called the deal a "very large and expensive private equity purchase and I believe it does not make economic sense."

Scott said there is "a lot of concern" at how the new company could be structured, while the Scottish National Health Service has urged the Government to block the merger.

Labour MSP James Kelly branded the takeover "disastrous" and added that the move would mean "a major financial blow to the people of Fife".

John Lamont, the MSP for Fife, said Fife's council is strongly opposed to the planned sale and insisted it is not a "fiercely held view".

However, he said his party is in talks with SNP politicians over a motion which could be tabled in the Scottish Parliament, though no agreement has been reached.

Lamprey chief executive Ian McKenzie, who is managing director of the joint firm, said the project has already brought significant long- term opportunities through a network of power stations, distribution networks and retail partners.

He insisted "this acquisition will only strengthen Scottish Power's position and create significant long-term value in the local community."
