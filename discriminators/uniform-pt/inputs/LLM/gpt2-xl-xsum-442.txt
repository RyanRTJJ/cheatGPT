 with underage clients.

The three women, and their ring, are now facing charges from the RCMP and the provincial Ministry of Labour.

The women worked for tattooists who had been working outside of the law for years, posing as the children's parents and letting their underage clients ink their bodies. But the RCMP said the tattooing wasn't about therapy or pain relief and was often associated with drugs and alcohol.

They also said some of the teenagers were addicted to drugs and alcohol, but they didn't want to hurt their clients or waste their time pursuing criminal charges.

"We want to make sure that people are not putting someone into pain that might require pain management medications," said Insp. Peter Drennan, an RCMP spokesperson. "[The girls] would do anything to make their clients feel better."

Police said the women were able to get the girls to tattoo "the day they gave her a needle".

The RCMP released pictures of the two women, wearing identical green tops and shorts with pink bow ties, and the three others. RCMP said they looked "dressed like a normal two-year-old."

Police identified one of the women working at a studio in Stouffville – in a YouTube video – as 20-year-old Katie Rousso from Stouffville.

The RCMP issued a news release on Monday saying the women had been arrested at a studio in Stouffville and were being held pending further charges.

The three women are expected to appear in court on January 20.

Police said the girls' parents had notified police before getting themselves tattooed, but none had told them about the women tattooing their children's bodies.

The CBC obtained dozens of pages from a search warrant from RCMP last month in which employees of the Tattooed Parents, Tattooed Angels and Tattooed Girls studios admitted paying an agency in Ontario $250 to $300 per tattoo.

The RCMP said no criminal charges have been laid against one of the tattoo artists who was working with the girls, and others have been suspended without pay.

RCMP were called to the studios after a Stouffville man complained four of his five children had been tattooed at three studios
