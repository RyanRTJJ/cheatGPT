My name is Rebecca and I had been living in a small town for the past few years, but my life had taken an unexpected turn recently. A few weeks ago I had been walking home from work when I was suddenly accosted by two men. They dragged me into an alley and attempted to rob me, but I managed to fight them off and escape.

Since then I had been living in fear, constantly worried that the men would find me and try to hurt me again. I had begun to feel like I was all alone, with no one to turn to for help, and I was desperate for a way out.

Then, one day, I made a call for help. I didn't know who I was calling or if anyone would even be listening. But I told them my story, and I begged for help.

The next day, I was met by a group of people who had heard my story and sympathized with my situation. They told me they would help me and they took me in and gave me shelter.

It wasn't long before I realized that I had found allies in this group of people, and I felt safer and more secure in their presence. With their help, I gradually began to rebuild my life and regain the faith I had lost in myself.

This was my call for help, and I am deeply grateful for all of their kindness and support.
