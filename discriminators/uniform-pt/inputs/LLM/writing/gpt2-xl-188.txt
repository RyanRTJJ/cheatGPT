_______ I can't feel it. Nothing but the air, too dry and still. _______ It's so numb that I can't move at all. A sharp stabbing pain sends me reeling. _______ I'm floating, like a fish out of water. _______ Not even my body is connected to anything. Not even the ground. It's a weird feeling, no longer moving. _______ _______ This is no longer me. _______ I feel like I am a creature no longer, even. _______ But the feeling inside me is still. I can't describe it, but I can feel my heartbeat. It's the power... it's coming back again. Everything. _______ It's the sensation of warmth, and then cold. And the feeling of falling. _______ A drop of it falls from the air, hitting the carpet, and splashing into my waiting fingers. _______ The feeling is almost painful, but not quite. I try not to look up while I move again. That's not like me. I haven't been able to feel that much. This ring had always just been in my hand. I'd never even known... _______ I am a thing now. Something is happening to me, that had never happened before. I feel... I know I know... what's going on. _______ I see her. I can feel her. I feel her power inside my own arms and on my hand and on the ring. Even if she isn't here, I still sense that we are connected somehow. I am part of her.... _______ I see her... and I... And she's watching me. And I'm watching her again. I want to tell her... She's beautiful. She's beautiful. What? Why? ________________________________________ [SFX] ________________________________________ All of the notes are in capitals but there are some lowercase letters.
