Jonny was walking home from his night shift when he heard a sound that sent a chill up his spine. He stopped in his tracks and listened; from far away he could hear an eerie voice calling out "Brians, Brians." Jonny was sure he was hearing things, and he started quickly walking again.

But then he heard the voice again. This time it sounded closer. He was certain it wasn't a personâ€¦it sounded almost like a zombie. He cautiously looked around and spotted a strange figure just a few yards away. It was a zombie, but it didn't look like any zombie he's ever seen before. Its movements were odd and clumsy, and it wore a pair of old-fashioned glasses.

Jonny watched in awe as the dyslexic zombie stumbled up to a signpost, peering at it like it was trying to read it. Then it slowly started moving away, repeating the same strange chant: "Brians, Brians."

Realizing what he was seeing, Jonny figured it must be searching for Brians. After all, dyslexia is a reading disorder and what better way to find someone than by searching for their name?

He wasn't sure what to do, so he decided to follow at a safe distance. Sure enough, it eventually stumbled into a nearby park and stopped in front of a nearby bench. There was a man sitting on the bench, and the zombie had clearly found what it was searching for.

Jonny quickly made his way over to them and watched as the dyslexic zombie slowly approached the man. The man seemed scared and confused, but then revealed a smile as it made out his name on the zombie's disordered lips: Brian.
