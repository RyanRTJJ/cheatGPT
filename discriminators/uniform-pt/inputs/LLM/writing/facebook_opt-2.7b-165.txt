  I like it as is, but would probably make it a short story:    "The Dark Tower", written by Cormac McCarthy.
Or it's prequel, The Road.
You know. That's one I haven't actually read or seen. Good thinking!
It's about a little boy and a large and strange, yet very powerful, creature. It's one of my favorites.
Makes me wonder if the books are actually as good as the movie... hmm.
Well, the books don't have the child-killing monsters and crazy people, and are much, *much* grayer. It's a far better read.
Interesting. I'll definitely put it on my list. Thanks for the insight. Sounds like the movie did some great things, though. It was definitely in a different league for me.
No problem. You've got time to check out both now. It's not like the original series is so old, most of its content is new! If you're not a fan, there's also the stand-alone story Midnight's Children(the most popular of the series), if that is your cup of tea.
I'll definitely check them out before the movie. The books are my favorite, but I don't mind the movies if they're up to par. I love Stephen King. I have read several of his books (they're all amazing), but haven't seen the movie version(s) to compare. It's kind of a waste, but I might, as a matter of fact, check them out now. Thanks again.
You're welcome, and they're worth it. There are some sequels that follow The Road, but that's the only one I can think of offhand.
Yeah, I saw some. I'm sure some of them had good ideas, but I'm not a fan. Maybe I'll check them out if I ever get around to a reread, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'll keep the idea of them in mind if I ever feel like starting a "I don't need to finish it series."
Yeah, I can usually get into sequels, but
