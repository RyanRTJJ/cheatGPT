2. (1) The first question before your prompt was: "How come I don't like it?" and so forth.

3. (2) The responses to the first two questions were pretty much the same: "It's a game. I don't really like Call of Duty Online!"

4. (3) The third response was "it's okay I don't really like Call of Duty Online."

And I'm not saying there weren't some odd and interesting answers, but as in:

5. (1) The first four answers for the second-hand stories were the same: "I don't really enjoy it, so don't tell me you're in it."

6. (1) The questions asked after, and after, were quite similar to those for the "how does your character get in and out of the game?" and "What does the world look like in the game?" questions.

7. (3) The "all the stories in the game" question (which actually seems very generic) was the same thing the other two answers for the answers for the "what's that sound like?" and "who does the character do the story?" answers.
