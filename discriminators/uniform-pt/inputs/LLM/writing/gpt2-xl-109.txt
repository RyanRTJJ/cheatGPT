 Then where will I go to for my answers.
Fill in your own description of what happens after you walk in the Door. This can be very vague or very specific as long as it is clear.
I look at everything as a door. As in, every single thing that happens must be considered. I could say I was told to watch for the door opening, but really, what do I mean by that? Do I mean a red light on the door, or a green light? Does this also count for red lights on doors that look like walls, or doors that are on a string? All I know is that all doors are possible, I am no closer to understanding this or knowing what doors can be opened. At its best, this is a bit silly. At worst, it is deeply stupid.
And then a door opens and I see an eternal door that leads to everlasting happiness. I have no idea what I have to do in order to get to God, only that it is possible. I will walk through it without asking too many questions, and it will lead me to eternal knowledge.
