The world was not one that anyone would have expected if they traveled back to the beginning of the 21st century. The one thing that everyone in the world knew was that the nutritional value of food was determined by its taste. No more did people worry about calorie counts, fat content or other things related to food and nutrition. Instead, when someone took a bite of something they could immediately tell what their body needed and how much of it was in the food. 

It was a revelation that made people around the world healthier and happier. People no longer needed to guess or assume what would fill them up without making them bloated and tired. They simply had to eat whatever tasted good and they would get what they needed.

This ease of access not only changed the diets of many people, but it also changed the world. People no longer worried about the shortage of fresh, local produce or the pesticides on many fruits and vegetables, because no matter what their food tasted like, it was always sure to contain exactly what their body needed.

Families and communities were brought closer together as well, since people no longer needed to make sure that everyone was eating healthily. No more were there debates about what was considered healthy and what wasn't. All that mattered was the taste of the food. 

The world was one in which people could trust that the food they enjoyed would give them the nutrition they needed. It was a world in which the taste of food brought people closer together and offered a relief from the needs of modern nutrition.
