I was the last human alive after the zombie apocalypse devastated civilization. For years, I had managed to survive on my own in my fortified home, avoiding the hoards of zombies that lurked on the outside. I longed for companionship, but it had been too dangerous to venture out and search for other survivors. 

One day, after I failed to avoid a zombie bite, I found myself transforming, my consciousness slowly fading into a mindless monster. But as I began to experience what it meant to be a creature of the undead, I realized that there was much more to life than I had ever imagined.

Zombies weren't mindless beasts - in fact, they were able to communicate with each other in a language that only they understood. And instead of being driven by a desire to feed on living flesh, they were driven by a collective purpose that went beyond individual needs. I had never felt such a strong bond with another creature.

Now, I had found a place within this new world - and I was accepted. For the first time in years, I was no longer a lone human wandering the earth - I was a part of a far greater universe.
