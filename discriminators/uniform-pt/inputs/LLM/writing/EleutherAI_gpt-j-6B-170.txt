You only get four words. They are all from the Bible. The story you tell must adhere to these guidelines:

It should be about you as a character.
It should involve the use of quotes from the Bible.

Let the prompt be enough of a story for you as an author. (If youâ€™re still not sure what to write about, check out this great exercise.)

Eve did not know the consequence, and that is why she ate the apple.

 She married him and became pregnant with their first child, Cain. She would tell Cain to kill his brother Abel. Abel did not do what she asked because he had sinned and could not be killed by God- so she killed him instead (the first murder). Cain did kill Abel because Eve told him to, just as God made an agreement with Cain that made Abel his brother's murderer. Cain became like Abel. God told Eve, that Cain would get punished for his brother's murder, by Eve.
