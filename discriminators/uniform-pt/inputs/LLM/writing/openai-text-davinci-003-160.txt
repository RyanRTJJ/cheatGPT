At first it was shocking, but then it became normal, waking up every day to see the same person lying next to me in bed. Marilla had been my roommate for two years, but I had never expected us to take such a drastic step. We were both single and nearing thirty, so after a particularly enjoyable night at the bar, the suggestion to move in together had seemed like a great idea.

As we settled into our new living arrangement, I noticed that the chemistry between us had grown beyond anything I had ever expected. We started to talk more and more, each day slowly easing into the next. It wasn't long before we both started to develop more intimate feelings for one another.

At first I was hesitant to pursue anything further, but Marilla seemed hellbent on exploring the possibility. Before I knew it, we had become a fully-fledged couple. I couldn't recall the exact moment I had made the decision, but the one thing I knew was that I had never been so content.

Even though the change in our relationship had been a shock at first, it soon became the new normal. We were happy together and had no desire to return back to our old ways. Instead, we decided to stick to our new adventure as an inseparable duo.
