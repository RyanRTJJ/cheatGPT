A few more words on this story to make it clear:
I started this story with some small bits I had worked out to build up to a more final form as a standalone story. The result is that there are more major differences between this story and the other ones I'm posting, especially between this story and my short story "Stumbling Across An Unwritten Law." This makes sense since this story is more than just a chapter from an ongoing story. Also, I'm a big believer in the idea that you can't know the direction in which an action will take without trying to make it happen as if it were an ongoing story, and the big difference in this story is that I'm focusing on the actual actions and consequences of those actions rather than the actions themselves. This makes the whole idea of "being pulled forward a few times" so much more powerful, and it also makes the whole idea of "playing with your ideas" seem so much more fun, since you will be able to see how they play out. In the last story "Heaven is for Real," I was really stuck, and I had to figure out a way to get around it because I was too lazy to come up with anything new myself. I wasn't even tempted to try to write that story again for some time, since I had realized it wasn't any better than most of the other things I do. But in doing a chapter a day for a bit, I got pretty burned out. I don't even know if that's good or bad -- I think it's possible to just burn out after making that many chapters all by yourself. I don't really care much for writing, but that was really what my creative drive came from. That's how I make money, anyway, and I made lots of money from that short story, so I'm pretty confident it can make more money than most of the other stuff I've written. After just five days of
