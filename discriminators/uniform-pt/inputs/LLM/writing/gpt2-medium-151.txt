Life is like a fish has its own way

Walking in darkness like a man who should not walk in darkness

(I knew there must be light)

In the middle of hell

Life is like a fish has its own way

Walking in darkness like a man who should not walk in darkness


I'm still holding my breath

Because what I've seen it's a woman

I heard about it online

And I'm still holding my breath

Because what I've been trying to figure out

Is if my dreams are right

This thing is not right

Just because there's no love in my heart

I still feel confused


What I have is a heart as a fish

That would die to get closer to a woman

What I have is a heart as a fish

That would drown to get closer to a woman
:M
