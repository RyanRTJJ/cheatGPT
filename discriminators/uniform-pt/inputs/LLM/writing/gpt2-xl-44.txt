 This has a lot of potential story potential since I always love the idea of someone discovering what the worst place in the universe is, and from there going through hell to get to their final destination – hopefully they don't meet the end of their road there along the way.
Send me a story that has a female character interacting with you.  I love to read stories which feature women in a positive light, and if you are able to show me something positive/funny/emotional that women can do when they interact with another woman, I will love you already.
Tell/tell me a story as if you were talking to someone – I love stories where the character is talking to someone from the outside perspective.  Just give me something that is a bit "off-hand" that someone might say, or could have potentially happened in your life, that would make it easier for me to read your story.
Submit your stories to me as an E-Mail using the RTF format. Remember, I won't reply to stories I have not already read – so don't be upset if I do not take your story. Here are some things I like: No hate mail, no abusive comments about my blog/how terrible I am at life.  
No profanity in the comments.
No "joke" stories, please.
No stories in which you've already been contacted through an established email/blog/reddit account.  You can still send your story to me, but please be aware of the potential risk and tell me so that I don't send you something I didn't read first.
Remember that it takes time to read each story, and after reading a story many times through out a couple of months (usually every 4-6 weeks), I may not even accept them, but to not be a good example, I will NOT accept any stories which have been rejected more than 3 times.
If you do choose to submit a story and like it enough – that's fine.  It does not mean I will be going out of my way to read your story.  Again, the only consideration I have to each
