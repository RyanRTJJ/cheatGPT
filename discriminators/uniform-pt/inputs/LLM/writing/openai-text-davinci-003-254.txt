Once, I was a tree in a small village. Every morning, I would watch the sun rise up in the sky and feel the gentle breeze passing through my leaves. I was always comforted by the sound of the birds chirping and the children playing right below me. Life was peaceful and I was surrounded by nature.

But everything changed one fateful day. Logging companies had come to the small village and were determined to chop me down for lumber. After a long day of labor, the workers had finished their task and I was lying down on the grass, my body in pieces.

Though my life had been taken from me, I still had purpose. Some of my wood was used to build a new house for one of the villagers. They treated me with respect and appreciation and I was proud to be a part of something so meaningful. My remains were distributed amongst many other people and I lived on through the things I had helped to make.

Though my physical form is gone, I am still here in spirit. I still feel the sun on my bare branches and the wind through my leaves. I am an eternal part of this small village, forever living in the minds and hearts of the people I once called home.
