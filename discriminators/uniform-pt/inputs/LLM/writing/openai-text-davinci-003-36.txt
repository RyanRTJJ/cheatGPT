Sammy was out in the woods playing when he saw something strange in the distance. His curiosity got the better of him and he started walking towards it - it was then that he realized what he was seeing: a serial killer dumping a body in the woods. 

Sammy was terrified, his heart beating out of his chest as he tried to back away slowly and silently. However, it was too lateâ€”the killer heard him, and Sammy froze in fear.

The killer came up to him and told him that if he ever said anything, or even thought about saying anything, the killer would find him and his family and kill them. The killer said that he would know if Sammy ever told anyone, and that this was Sammy's one chance to stay alive. 

Scared out of his mind, Sammy slowly nodded and the killer put a finger to his lips and warned Sammy never to speak a word about what he saw and then left. 

Terrified, Sammy stumbled back home and never told a soul about his terrifying experience. As time passed, he became more and more paranoid and eventually left that town, determined to never look back. He never wanted to be reminded of the horrific experience he had stumbled upon that day.
