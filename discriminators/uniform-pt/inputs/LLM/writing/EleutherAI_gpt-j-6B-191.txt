 You are obsessed. You are a follower. You are a believer. Bruce Wayne is a bad person. Bruce Wayne is the enemy. Bruce Wayne is Batman. Bruce Wayne is an anti-Christ, like Hitler was...

So, first I thought that maybe there was no one good enough to do all this so I picked you.  But then I saw his other answer.  I like his story as it's a little closer to the way the character would look. I would have to agree with him on the conclusion at first as well.  I do think that the first solution is more of a conspiracy.  In this one they're just talking.  If you do this however the way I think Battey would do this you can't let this character go anywhere.  If they didn't go anywhere in the second story it would make me feel like not that the people making the story didn't know Batman well enough.  I think these are the same character.

 If Bruce Wayne is a conspiracist then there's another person out there who is a conspiracist as well but they're not as close friends.

Another character that is a little bit similar to the question is a young, yet intelligent and powerful, villain who believes in the conspiracy theory. So, let's call him Q-N-I-T-I-S-T (Q stands for Quicksilver, N for Neo, I for Illuminati and so on). He wants to know that Bruce Wayne is Batman, and he wants to discredit Batman as much as possible. He knows that it might be dangerous and/or difficult for him since Bruce Wayne is a billionaire and he is an orphan. Q-N-I-T-I-S-T doesn't plan to kill Bruce Wayne, however, he knows that killing people might affect all of them, including himself. Therefore, he tries to find evidence, tries to persuade, tries to influence, that Batman is not the real Batman and that Wayne is indeed Batman. You may use either Batman or Bruce Wayne to answer the question. 
If you are going to have multiple conspiracies, you
