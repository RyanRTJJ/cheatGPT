I think it would be way harder than just writing a simple "AI is a simulation" story. Because you would need to make the simulation be in some part of a story.
Another thing to think about is how complex the simulation (whatever it is, it might be something that you know and I do not know). How did it all come to be?
Also, what is the motivation of the creator? Why did it create this simulation in the first place? If he wanted to mess with us, to make science fiction entertainment for us, then just write fiction that portrays him that way. But to do all of that just for an experiment to see how much human behavior he can subvert, I think is way too much.

Just write fiction that portrays the creator that way.

Also, what is the motivation of the creator? Why did he create this? Why bother creating it in the first place? If he/she/it wants to play God, they probably have better things to do.

I am not sure how one can use writing to express or explain consciousness.

You’ve just used it to express what you don’t know how to express with your non-fiction.
If it can’t be explained with your non-fiction, then it’s not non-fiction about the subject.

Yes yes yes yes. I wish it were that simple but I don’t think you can really do that. There are so many possible combinations of consciousness or something-ness or whatever and that’s only the beginning.

We don't know if the whole universe is a simulation (or if our consciousness/soul etc. are just part of the simulation), and that seems like a much more important question to me.
Why bother trying to simulate the universe? How interesting would it not just to leave it alone and let it be? Are the implications of that too horrible to consider?

What if reality isn't real
