 They both look different, and some, like us, prefer to believe more from one side than the other. Neither group has an absolute position of knowledge, just facts, or reality. The two groupings suggest the world is still waiting to be told. But are there truths yet? Let's turn this story up and see if there are any truths to tell. One of the groups reveals itself to us, and we can be sure that each point is coming true. The other group offers to explain this story, and we will, of course, do. The first group reveals our world.  Our world is the future, and we can be sure that any group representing the future will have to accept our truth.   If we take the truth given to us by a group of present-day travelers, and turn our head to our nearest possible point and ask how far we can be from this group's present-day self, we will be in for a rude awakening. Some of these travelers have told us that a future world is not the same as the present one. Or that the current world will be different from the previous. Or that a different, but still different future exists, if all travel by now has to be done outside the present world.  But there are very few of these travelers to tell the truth, and it will take us some time to learn what we would like us to accept. We would like to see the "next part of this story." We could be told this world that we can reach (something that most of us would rather not know about) by a group of future travelers. We would still be in the present, but we might be even more certain that there will, eventually, be a future beyond what has now come to us. Our experience with the world we would like to see may not be as good as what we currently are able to see.
