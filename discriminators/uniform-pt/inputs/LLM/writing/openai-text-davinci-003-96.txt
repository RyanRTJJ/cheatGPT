It all started on the first day of hero school. I remember walking into the massive, marbled hall of the academy, excitement and antsy energy emanating in the air. Everyone inside was talking about their superpowers, bragging and showing off, but as soon as I stepped into the room, the chatter and laughter slowly died down. 

I took my place in the middle of the hall, and people were already starting to snicker and giggle at me. Nobody else had a superpower like mine: free refills. I heard people whisper that mine was useless and irrelevant. I wanted the ground to swallow me whole. 

Soon enough, the kids had given me a nickname that stuck for all of hero school: "Brian Refills." I was teased and made fun of at every given opportunity. But I had secrets of my own. I knew that this so-called "useless" superpower had much more potential than anyone realized.

The villain and the minions were momentarily stunned. I picked up the container and then took the opportunity to run. 

Turns out, the green liquid was a volatile and dangerous mutagen
