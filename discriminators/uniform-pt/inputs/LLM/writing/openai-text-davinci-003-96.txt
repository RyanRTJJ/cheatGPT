It was a somber day for the entire world as the news of an incoming asteroid due to hit the earth today filled everyone's ears. Preparations were quickly made for the end of life as almost everyone knew it was coming, yet no one wanted to accept it. People hugged each other, said goodbye, and prepared for the worst. 

But then something miraculous happened â€“ the world heard an announcement that the asteroid had miraculously changed its direction, heading away from Earth. Everyone was stunned and overwhelmed with a mix of relief, shock and confusion.

It was an awkward time for everyone following the bombshell announcement. The mood of preparation and sorrow was replaced with an air of embarrassment. Everyone was embarrassed and ashamed at assuming the worst while they had the opportunity to celebrate joy. 

Days, weeks and months later, the world would slowly accept the miracle of what had taken place. But, during this moment all anyone could do was blush and mumble an apology to their loved ones who they had thought they would never see again. Everyone was feeling super uncomfortable in this very strange situation; nobody knew what to say or do. 

We all learned today a hard lesson: never take life for granted and always hope for the best. Even in the most dire circumstances, there may be a light at the end of the tunnel.
