  Also, is it a black and white picture for some reason?   Anyway, I like it. If I had an idea where to start, I'd probably just go with "I dream of an alternate world where the war never happened. I'm a small but growing part of the resistance to it."
Yeah I tried to switch pictures but it failed. It's not a black and white picture, I couldn't find any pictures that gave it that grey/cyan atmosphere I was going for. It's a black and white film where the "bad guys" are doing it too. I don't really know how else to describe it other than if it was a movie. :P I'll think on this one anyway. Thank you.
No problem! If I had the chance to make a film about this, I would definitely do this. :) It's a very cool idea!
I tried to change some of the images that were in one image. The grey is supposed to be more grey and the blue is supposed to be blue but that didn't work as well. I got rid of the whole main image and I was thinking that I might start off in a different world, but you could just go over there because the world in the main image was really boring. :P
Fair enough. I like it better as it is. I just like the idea of a resistance. I feel like it would be cool to have a few parts of the story be a story based on the actual people in history who really existed in the real world. The war of independence. A movie about the Civil War. All of those things would be really cool. But I could definitely see this story having it's own sort of storyline.
I just really like the idea of the story not being about how our world or America or America invaded and tried to destroy some other country, but all our lives leading up to it. I think that will
