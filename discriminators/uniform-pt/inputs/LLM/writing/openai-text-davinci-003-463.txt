I crawl through a hot, dirty parking lot, making my way from one side to the other. The journey is difficult and dangerous, and yet with every difficulty there comes a new discovery. Every asphalt crack is an adventure, every nook and cranny a source of intrigue.

At every stop I take, I feel the warmth radiate up from beneath me as if the sun were catching me in its rays. I look both ways before crossing a great yawning break in the pavement, crawling over rocks and pebbles to make the jump.

As I move closer to the other side of the lot, I feel my legs become more steady and my wings more powerful. Even so, it is still a difficult journey. The sheer size of this place and the distance I have to go are dispiriting, but I continue forward, determined to make it to the other side.

Suddenly a shadow creeps up on me, and I freeze. I look up to see a giant bird-like creature, the size of a car, hovering over me. It stares down at me with its beady yellow eyes, and I feel my heartbeat quicken. I scurry under a rock for protection, hoping I won't be spotted, and thankfully it passes by.

It was a close call, but at last I arrive at the other side of the parking lot. I can breathe a sigh of relief. I have made it! I look back at my long journey, feeling proud of myself for making such an arduous journey and coming out unscathed. I'm ready for the next adventure!
