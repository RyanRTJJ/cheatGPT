Once upon a time, there was a curious little boy named Max who always wanted to know what was under his bed. Every night before bed, he would demand that one of his parents look under the bed for monsters. This ritual always prompted a chuckle from Max's parents, then one night came an unexpected surprise.

Max's father bent down to check and gasped with horror. There, tucked underneath the bed, was a small creature with huge eyes and a long, pointy tail. It hissed at Max's father, who quickly backed away from the bed before quietly leaving the room.

Once the door was shut, Max couldn't believe his eyes. He had always known there were monsters under the bed, but this was the first time he had actually seen one!

The little monster seemed friendly enough and, after some coaxing, was soon happily snuggling up to Max under his warm blankets. Max named his new friend 'Steve' and they became inseparable.

Max and Steve developed a strong bond; they would stay up late into the night playing games and telling each other stories. Max's parents were amazed by the way Steve had won their son over and the four of them became good friends.

Max and Steve's friendships stands to this day and is a testament to the power of friendship, no matter what type of creature you may be.
