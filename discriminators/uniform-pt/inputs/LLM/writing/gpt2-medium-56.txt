____________________________________________ I'm sure you want to know why The New Yorker thinks John Lewis should speak at the Democratic Convention next week. If you want to know why he deserves it, well, here you go, for those who can handle math: I've always been a supporter of Lewis, and I don't mean to disrespect Lewis or his colleagues -- I support them and all members of their Democratic Party. I certainly don't believe that they can be controlled by a single member of the Democratic Party. But, I do believe that it is the responsibility of any one of the Democratic Party's supporters to organize the political conversation on any issue that they care about, and especially those issues with whom Lewis identifies as politically important or sensitive.

So, it's a clear indication, I think, to the country, not only that no one wants our national leadership to be in the hands of a member of their own party, but also that they want The New Yorker to be the nation's most prominent advocate for the liberal principles that it espouses. I just want to read what that endorsement means to The New Yorker. To understand why I think
