This morning, as I absent-mindedly stirred my coffee, I was taken aback when I heard a faint hum making its way through my skull. I stopped my stirring and cocked my head; the song playing from the radio slowly began to sink in. I felt myself become wistful and fixated. I found myself slipping into some sort of trance, all the while the song taking control, droning in the background.

Though I was entirely confined to my seat, it felt as though the walls were taken away and the lyrics were swirling all around me, coming at me like flames of a fire. They seemed to spark something deep inside me. I was beyond comprehension, lost in a swirl of emotion and excitement. I had unwittingly hypnotised myself.

The sensation was indescribable as the beat of the song surged throughout me. I felt like I was absorbing each emotion and sound of the song and I would never be the same. It felt like I was in a trance and could not escape until the song had fully taken control.

Finally, after what felt like eternity, the song was over, leaving me shaken and stirred. I felt different, like something had been unlocked within me and I had stepped into a new world. I was still overwhelmed by the experience, but excitement filled me instead of dread. I knew that from that day on, music would have a profound effect on my life.
