The massive outcry from the public was heard from every corner of the country, and soon, around the world. After the first case was announced of an individual being sentenced to prison for one hundred thousand years, indignation and outrage sparked among society. It seemed like an outrageous and cruel punishment, as if being in prison for life plus was not enough.

But what the public didn't know was that the laws had changed due to the technology that had become available. After the research and development of the transfer of consciousness to computer databanks had become successful, functional immortality was no longer just a pipe dream. It had now been achieved, and with it came new laws and regulations.

The individual in question had been found guilty of a heinous crime and the judge felt that no other prison sentence would be fitting. The individual had to be punished commensurate with their crime, and so the judge made the only logical choice at the time. The judge was well aware of the controversy that would be sparked by the sentence, but felt that it was necessary.

The public was furious. Every day, demonstrations were held and petitions were signed. People argued that the sentence was unjust, that it violated human rights, and that it was far too harsh. After months of protests and angry debates, a decision was reached. The individual was released from prison and their sentence was changed to life plus one thousand years.

This decision was met with a wave of relief and jubilation. People felt that justice had been served
