Can't find much more than a mention in   
this blog. Can you find the book and its title?

_The World Turned Upside Down_ by Alice Bradley Sheldon is the title of a book that has a series of chapters that is more like a story than a book. It describes the story of a life in a dystopian future world. The society is called Dystopia-America. Here are some of the chapters of the book:   
.
Chapter 1 "We were all born at the same time, in the same place and in the same manner"

Chapter 2 "It was time to kill the king"

Chapter 3 "I did not want to kill anyone; the very thought of it made me sick, but I could not see what else to do"

Chapter 4 "I am a prisoner of war and must die"

Chapter 5 "As for the doctor, he said nothing, only he knew what had happened. The boy died."

This chapter is not a book as we know a book but just part of a whole story. Alice Bradley Sheldon's book contains over 800 pages of text.   
This part of _The World Turned Upside Down_ is about a girl named Mary. Mary's town has to be destroyed because it is a breeding ground for the diseases of the past and in the present. It is not really the end of the world.

_The Book of Revelations_ tells us that "the end could not come soon enough." (This part of the book is just a short introduction to the Bible.) In this world, we are being warned that we are too indulgent and must learn to be more obedient.
