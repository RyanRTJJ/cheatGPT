  * Write a story based on this prompt: [ UK ] When you're feeling like shit, have you been asked for money before? If you haven't how did you feel when someone had the nerve to ask you for it? Did the thought of having to hand it to them bring a sour taste to your mouth? If you felt anything like that, have you ever thought on how it would feel to never get it back? Maybe in the same way you feel when you're hungry and someone says to take a number? How did you feel when they took your number?

## THE END OF THE WORLD

**The world you and I live in is changing. Things that haven't happened to us yet could happen to us, and things that are still going on could be over before we knew it. What happens when what we think of as a constant, solid world suddenly falls away...what does it mean?**
