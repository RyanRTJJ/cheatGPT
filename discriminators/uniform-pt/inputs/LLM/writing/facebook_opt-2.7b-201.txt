 Now the story: *I go back in time and fix everything*  Who would be interested to see a low fps tale? I figure it's worth a shot; I'm only asking for my own amusement.
Wouldn't it have to be a story that is actually about running low on frames per second? Like a fps story about going to a video store instead of just saying you would watch a movie at the video store because it looks better (like, as opposed to a story about a single frame per year)
You're right; but it will probably get me a few more readers, so it's probably worth a shot. :)
I feel like I read your story before it was taken down, if its there its on one of my old laptops
Oh, I never took it down. Just got downvoted into oblivion with no explanation. Then one day someone found it and was like, "What on earth was that?"  It just didn't catch on here, like a "pics or it didn't happen", so I pulled it off.  *sigh*
Well I enjoyed it. Keep doing what you're doing! Not everyone is up on the internet lingo, myself included. I'm surprised you even had a story on the internet at all!
I probably got at LEAST a dozen emails of, "Holy shit, a FPS story on the internet? Why didn't anyone think of this before?"  I tried to help, but I'll probably try to write something up tomorrow. It has been years since I've written a story, so it's actually quite pleasant for me to re-learn how to write.
You can use the downvote button for a good reason.
Sometimes I just don't care.
I didn't mean to upset you, just letting you know.
