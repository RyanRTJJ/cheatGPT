In a world where anything can change shape, this posed a unique problem to the citizens. How do you recognize people if they can look completely different with just a thought?

The answer?  Tattoos. 

Scientists and academics looked into the possibility of using body art as a form of identification. It was a risky endeavor as there wouldn't be any way to undo it if they turned out to be wrong. However, in the end, it was decided that tattoos were the most reliable means of keeping track of a person's real identity, especially for those who had the power to shapeshift.

The country passed a law mandating that all shapeshifters be required to have a permanent tattoo adorned with a series of complicated symbols known only to them. They would then carry a certificate with them at all times verifying their identity so that if they ever shifted, they would be recognizable by their tattoos.

This system worked quite well. Every citizen, whether human or shapeshifter, was given a unique set of symbols that could be scanned for identification purposes. Even if someone shapeshifted, their tattoo would remain the same and make them easy to spot.

Though it was an imperfect solution, it was the best that the shapeshifting world had come up with so far. At least now, they would be able to recognize their own in a crowd of different forms.
