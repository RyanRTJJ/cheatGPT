Ever since I could remember, I had always been fascinated with memories that seemed to be shared with me, that I knew weren't my own. They were often full of joy and seemed to come out of nowhere. When I was young, I believed I was psychic, that I had some special power to tap into thoughts and memories that weren't mine. As I grew older, however, I learned that I was experiencing ancestral memories, that I had a connection to my ancestors that was allowing me to see into the past. 

The memories seemed to come at the most inopportune times, and I'd catch snippets of conversations, faces and places that were, for the most part, unrecognizable to me. Yet, there was always some feeling of familiarity, of connection, that left me wanting to know more. 

I didn't fully understand what was happening until I started researching my family history. The further back I went, the more I was beginning to understand my connection to these memories I kept having. I began to learn about my ancestors and their lives, the events and experiences that may have been the root source of these memories I had been having.

As much as I wanted to ignore them, the memories kept coming. They reminded me of who I was, and the where I had come from. Over time, I've begun to embrace them, allowing them to shape who I am today and shaping the path I take forward. I still don't fully understand what they mean, but I know that they help me to stay connected to my past and the people who came before me.
