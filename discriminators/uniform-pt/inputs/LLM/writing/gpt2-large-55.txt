 A dream taken out of your mind that you thought was gone forever when you were about 11.  You wake up to a phone call in which the person who called is asking how you are.  Now you need to figure out your next move.  You need to figure out if this is the story you really want to tell.  How are you going to tell them?  If you don't do this right, the dream is going to take off a totally different route.  For a man to go through this journey, he's going to take risks with his dreams.  A man can't put all of his eggs in the dream basket and not have some things that need to be addressed.  If he has a few things you need, he can be a bit more flexible in crafting the tale.  If you don't have the things you need, the dream is going to have a story that you just won't understand and the outcome can be very different. When crafting a dream, think about how you want to tell the story to both yourself and everyone else.  Does an older brother or other family member come up to you in the night, or maybe you catch your friend with your friend in case something scary is happening?  Do you want the story to go into the dream's background on the way in, or do you want it to go right into a character's backstory?  When crafting a story, be able to tell the different parts of the story to the right person, in order to help create a story that resonates with these people.  For a girl, tell her the story about your dream as a little girl.  Tell this to the dreamer as she's waking up on the next day. For a man, tell him the story of your dream as a man.  It'll be very, very different, but it will help to flesh out his personality
