......................................................................................................................... The reason this prompt was created is because of someone not liking those who were given higher scores than average on various threats to their lives such as danger in school(1), threats to their homes(1), etc., etc.. Also, I wanted to allow my readers the chance to participate in creating a specific scenario in order to give that parent some much appreciated insight into how well they feel about themselves! So, please send me your scenario by sending mail to: Your Name Your Email Your Email may be withheld for personal considerations. Thank you!


NOTE: I am only available Tuesday through Friday, 8:30AM to 4:00PM Eastern Standard Time (EST).


What is your response to this prompt? Tips? Complaints? Requests? Drop me a line here. I'm always happy to discuss this or any other mywriting topic.

Note: Some of the questions I receive require a signature prior to publication (although you still have 48 hours to reply to me with your signature - for copyright reasons only). If you prefer not to complete my response or wish I could answer your question earlier, please send it in as a comment on the relevant writing under the title of your letter. Thanks!
