 Have people in the audience say things like "You`ve pulled it off better than I thought".
This just might be the perfect reason to have a third party spy on the actors while they are performing. And then have it released just before showtime to get everyone killed off anyway.
Or just let an actor walk offstage without anyone noticing, and not tell the others. You can have that character come to him/her and tell a backstory, about how he came to be there (through death maybe) and he then turns around, looks surprised, does his pose, and you reveal an actor in disguise/s who was responsible for the whole stunt and that is who is standing there.
This is what I had in mind too, at least this way you could explain how this happened, and at least it wasn't straight out of /r/watchpeopledie
You mean /r/watchpeopledie?
Oops. Yeah, I guess so. I must have gotten them mixed up.
The /r/ is there because of the 'e' not /r/  Because /r/ would also link that subreddit which would be wayyy to long if people would be wanting to link it as well as /r/watchpeopledie  Or at least that's how that works for me.
Haven't visited it on mobile so maybe that's it. Thanks for the clarification, man. I'll change that right away.
It's also because of the spaces, the r/ is a pound symbol at the beginning of most words, ie. /r/watchpeopledie the rest of the characters can still be read  If people think your comment is getting spam filtered, they're also not taking the spaces into account, so it looks to the human eye more like /r/watchpeopledie if not properly formatted.
