Fiona's life wasn't always perfect. She had just completed her university degree, having taken a few years off to get her finances in order. Working hard, she was now comfortably employed in a job she enjoyed and had enough money in the bank to look forward to a financially comfortable future.

Every night in her sleep, Fiona would encounter her future self - a successful, happy, confident woman who instructed her on the best way to spend the following day. She usually complied, and it paid off; her life was going well.

Until one day when Fiona dozed off during the daytime. She found herself in her bedroom, only this time the figure she met was tired and disheveled. This future self begged Fiona not to listen to the others, who may have been wrong. She urged Fiona to take more breaks, to take risks, and to trust her own gut. 

To her own surprise, Fiona found herself heeding this version's words and trying out new experiences and taking a few more risks. This was not the future she had expected, but it seemed to be steering her on the right path. 

She continued to take advice from her future self, balancing more risk-taking with practical considerations. Before she knew it, Fiona was happier and more successful than she had ever been before. 

It just goes to show, Fiona thought to herself, that sometimes it pays to listen to the most unexpected advice.
