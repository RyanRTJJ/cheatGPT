Once upon a time there was a brave hero named Erhard. He lived in a small village and was known for his courage and selflessness. He always put others before himself and was willing to go to any length for their protection.

One day, a great monster threatened to tear apart the village and all its inhabitants. The people were panicked and had no idea how to deal with the situation. It seemed as if there was no hope until Erhard stepped forward.

Drawing from his courage, Erhard charged towards the monster, sword in hand. He battled valiantly and eventually managed to defeat the creature. The people cheered in relief.

But, in the aftermath of his heroic deed, Erhard realized that he had only saved himself. All of the people he had wanted to protect were dead and gone.

Erhard slowly began to question his worth as a hero. How much of a hero was he, if all he had managed to save was himself? He had done his best but it just wasn't enough. His greatest failure had not been to stop the monster, but in not doing even more to protect the people.

Erhard vowed, then and there, that he would never rest until he was able to help others, no matter what the cost.

And that is the story of Erhard, the hero who ultimately realized that true heroism means giving of oneself beyond oneself.
