 How can these two societies be saved?
Thank you! This is actually a really interesting way of thinking about this.  I can work with'solved' this way. Also, I will add your suggestion to the piece :)
I think you should ask the people here if they're into metal before you do that.
You're absolutely right. Didn't think about this. Thank you!
