 A chilling thought." What a chilling thought.  My head felt a bit heavy.  I have to be honest.  I think this one could've worked better. As it stands, this is my first attempt at making it look like the writer saw something of an issue before it was shot.  I did that by adding a black silhouette through my eyes.  All I am saying is I wish it was a little less blurry.  The fact that the text has to be covered in black or in another black shade of white is just too distracting.  This is kind of a nightmare to me, and I could go on and on about this topic.  But I've got to get back to writing with this pencil, because I have some other assignments to do, so I'm doing the next best thing for now.  The next chapter?  That's a big question.  This is going to be one of those pieces of writing where it might end up in a book and I just need to figure out how I am going to put one together and make time to do it.  I know I am going to have an epic tale to tell to a class filled with people who have watched my career progress like no other at this point so it may not be the easiest subject to make an honest comment on.  But whatever the case may be, I look forward to hearing it in the class next week. I'm getting a lot of email this week asking me how this came out.  I really want to thank everyone for emailing in and checking me out.  I know this may come off as an odd request, especially from someone who has written me hundreds of letters telling me to go get lost but I just feel like it is really important to know so we can work together better and have that conversation.  I didn't expect this to take so long
