   I might come back to this some morning.
"Now that I've been given this job I will go into the city and start setting traps."
Lol yes. They're already out there. It's sad too.... There were just so many people who had to be saved from this. It was one of the most horrible things I've ever seen.
The sad thing is that I'm not sure I could get over the fact that someone could want to do this to these animals they consider family. A lot of these dogs come from bad backgrounds. It would break me.
Dogs are family. Period. No matter what they've been through. They will always do you and only you a favor if you take care of them. They will help you when you need a friend, or when there is a problem to solve. They will bring you joy. They are the family to have.
Wow. That's really sweet. There's something in my chest that hurts for you and your dogs.
I know. I've had one since kindergarten. They can be a handful sometimes. But when you start to understand things there is a connection that is made. You can trust and rely on them with that connection. But you're right - if it hurts you, it definitely hurts me too.
I've never had a dog so I wouldn't know what they're capable of. Can you tell me some stories about these dogs?
A lot more stories to go through before I can get back to you. I just wanted people to understand that they are one of the best things that could ever happen to anybody. I still have a lot of work to do. I have to keep fighting the good fight.
That's all I really wanted to know. Thank you so much. I wish I could have a dog.
