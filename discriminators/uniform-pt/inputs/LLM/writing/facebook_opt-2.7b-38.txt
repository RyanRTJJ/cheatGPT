  Be honest about the outcome of this. If you think the public will believe you're an asshole and if you do an AMA on the topic, be prepared for people to disagree with you.
Not OP, but I'm sure there are plenty of historians who would be thrilled to dig into the life of a man who was supposedly a child rapist and murderer.   It wouldn't even be too hard to find out, since I'm sure that if his life in the Roman empire wasn't completely overshadowed by his crucifixion, it would be easy enough to find out what he was up to.
Would he, though?  For all we know, he might have been completely straight.  People can get pretty hung up on things like "What if..." scenarios in historical fiction.   That would just be a bad example to set.  Especially when you consider the historical figures' wives (or husbands) were likely the suspects, not their children.
Yeah, like if he had a long-secret affair with your ancestor, or whatever.
Maybe if he did. But is there really all that much proof?  As I stated above, people get really hung up on things they don't know much about.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure Jesus didn't actually have any male role models in life except the guy from that one story in Mark. And he only had a boyfriend for the entire time he lived.
What about his dad?  That guy's pretty well known, though.  He's a pretty famous biblical figure.    Jesus was a pretty well-known figure as well, from what I remember.  I think it'll be extremely hard to convince anyone of anything if you're simply claiming "What If..." with no supporting evidence.
You don't really have to convince anyone to read the bible.
Why do you read Bible?
Why do I not read it?
