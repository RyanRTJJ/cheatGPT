 What do you do? Why you make it so awesome  Or the reverse and make the dumbest concept possible and make it awesome
I mean I have been using most of my perks on a test vault so i could use one of these
Which will lead to its ultimate demise and you get an A for effort
Not if it goes well.  They got high vault level, probably lots of science items in their vaults. I bet a few of the experiments on the test vault caused a lot of power drain, so the excess power could feed into a big ass generator.  I dunno, maybe even a fusion core generator of sorts.
Theoretically. But i think the best thing to do would be to find a vault in the middle of nowhere. Get the inhabitants to live as the residents of the vault do, except with no science tech. But try to get as many science items as possible so it has something to survive with (and that's assuming that there aren't any experiments to use, and there's no tech in a big ass generator)
That would be interesting.  I'd like to see the best and worst of each vault - the most creative and creative and most innovative.  I'm sure that someone will put together a big ass, high powered generator using a big ass nuclear reactor.  I don't know, something interesting that I'll put in the game.  Maybe a vault only open to the members of certain religious organizations.
I think you should make another one now, and start it now. We'll send you to it. Then you can take that idea and run with it.  Maybe you will find an infinite amount of generators, but when you set them up, they get destroyed by aliens or something.
Oh this isn't really related, but I'm really proud of
