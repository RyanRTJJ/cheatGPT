 I can only hope this is you, because that would be the most boring thing ever, but you do go out in a blaze of glory by killing something that could have been a child.
The thing is, it could be anyone. Maybe the next person on the line will be a child, or maybe the next one will be a parent, that's the terrifying part. We can't know who is next in line, nobody can know.
That's why it's sooooo boring! People would rather read a story about a serial killer and have to deal with the consequences and their victims than the opposite.
Oh, agreed. There's just a chance that they could be your mother or a child or a teacher. You never know.
That's why this is so exciting! If there was only a serial killer who only killed the ones we wanted, then no one would ever do it because we'd always know who they are and they couldn't do it.
And because of this, everyone would become a serial killer.   "If we didn't kill these people then they'd kill more people".   And so on... for forever.   So, we kill them now. And they'll come back. Always.   Fuck it! Let's just start killing!  Let's put that genie in a bottle.
Everyone who is interested in doing illegal shit might start doing so to stay anonymous. I would never trust my own family no matter how much I want to trust them. I would always try to kill them.
There is a way to stay anonymous, but it also takes work. Work that would get me killed.   "Hey, so I found a safe way to stay anonymous"   *gets caught robbing a house*   How much to die?   *gets caught writing an article saying he lives a secret life*
This guy gets it.  This is exactly me.  I'm gonna get some help and a new identity
