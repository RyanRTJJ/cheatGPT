Oh god, this sounds terrible!  I do like your idea though, because I have never played FFX though I do know it existed and I have watched a lot of let's play videos. It'll be challenging to make it work.  You may be right tho, maybe its easier to make it a five minutes video because if I do the 5 minute story it'd be around 16-17mins to make the full film.  Thanks!
A lot of video games do this as a short story. Look at Halo or Bioshock's gameplay story. They're a lot easier to get away with lengthwise, but it was still amazing. They'll be long for you, but the story itself will be very well written. You'll definitely keep it to a five minute video, for sure.
Oh yes, definitely. The gameplay storyline I could definitely do on a five minute video. The thing of note here is this will likely be the first film I will ever do.  I've been doing film for years and film is definitely my way of going... but never done fiction... so I feel like I'm in over my head with this, haha.
Film is the best way to work towards writing, but no one writes a script in six weeks. Take your time. It's going to need work. You'll eventually be able to tell story better and better, and then it's more than a movie.
So far I like your advice.  Thanks!
Write something simple for now. Make something a little more complex later on.
Thanks! That's what I'm doing right now.  Writing something very basic, even if it's not good.  Thanks!
Keep at it. Write stories. Learn everything you can. Practice writing scenes and paragraphs until you become a pro at it. Then start adding all
