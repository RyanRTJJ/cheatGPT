 Include the following:  "Do you like it when I lick you? When I bark? When I howl? Why do you need to go? I guess this is what you wanted to happen."  Or if you need more context,  "My name is _____. You're a beautiful dog. Your humans and I love you so much. I'm grateful for the time you gave us."
I really liked the second option more if this helps. Thank you for helping me out.
That is a good way to express it.  And glad you like the second one.  It's a good way to express how the dog is thinking about everything before it dies.  It's not trying to be emotional, more like a dog watching the world go by.  You could change the name (the last part of the email) to your first initials so you can write back to the dog again, but it would sound cheesy at times.
True. I'll try to do the same. Thanks for the input! It would be sad if he passed away.. I think i'll have to write about him a bit more. He was such a great dog!
Good luck.  Let us know what you write.  We're rooting for the dog!
I ended up just doing the same thing. I decided to call him Toby. It has been a little over 1 year since my dog died (he was 14). I miss him so much.. I think I'll visit him again. Thank you so much for responding! :)
Sorry for your loss.  You've kept the relationship alive,  and that's great.  I'm sure Toby really misses you too!
Thank you! My life is a little crazy right now so it's good that I can keep that going.
