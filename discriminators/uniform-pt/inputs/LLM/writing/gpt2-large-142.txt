 A family has moved to Earth, their children and pets have escaped as well.  It's a very tense time – the world has turned against them!  Who will be next for the Aliens?  The story is set in a near future of mankind, and the story will run from mid-March through Mid-April 2017.  You must bring your own pen, paper, scissors and pencil! Your story must have a main character. You may select an original character, or pick from among other characters from the World of Warcraft Adventure Game universe! Your story should have a beginning, middle and end.  There will be a central antagonist with whom you must be linked. You can use a single image, or create a full body of imagery.  I'll be updating the plot as the story progresses, and we'll see how well we can stay on track! You must be able to work at an Illustration size.  
This is the first year for the $1 and $2 rewards, and next year we'll try something different. If you have any other story ideas, please let us know by sending us your entries by Dec. 8, 2017, at 11 am (ET).
