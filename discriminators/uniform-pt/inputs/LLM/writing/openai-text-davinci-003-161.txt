I live in a void. A dark, lonely place where nothing makes sense and nothing matters. I am surrounded by a relentless fog of emptiness, hovering like a heavy invisible blanket over my life. Nothing seems to bring me joy and no amount of effort can pierce through this invisible wall of despair.

I live in a state of perpetual hopelessness, where I feel disconnected from the rest of the world and numb to the world around me. I can't bring myself to care about anything: not my job, not my relationships, not even my own well-being. Everything feels like a chore and a burden, an effort that I can't summon the energy to make. 

I often feel like a failure, overwhelmed by the expectations of my life that seem to be so far out of reach. Nothing I do is ever quite good enough and I feel too exhausted to push myself further. 

I can't escape the pervasive gloom that surrounds me, it's like my brain is on a loop of negativity and self-loathing. Where I once found pleasure and purpose, I now can't find my way through the darkness and confusion. 

Life feels like an exercise in futility. I just can't seem to make it work. The days pass me by, each one feeling like the last, with nothing to look forward to, no light at the end of the tunnel. It's just an endless array of dread and sadness, a vast emptiness that threatens to swallow me up whole. 

Depression is a prison, an inescapable void that sucks you in and doesn't let go.
