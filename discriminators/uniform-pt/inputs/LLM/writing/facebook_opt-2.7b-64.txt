 What happens next? Where does the country turn? What happens to its culture?
That seems like one of the most fun prompt/sets to write! Definitely have to do this!
Awesome! And don't forget to post it to r/fantheories, too.
Will do, and thanks for your help! :)
No problem. Let me know if you need any help.
Thank you :) I could probably do a rough draft if you'd be willing to proofread it, but that's probably all that will be required to get it out there. :)
Sure. Just PM me, and I'll send you my email. I've updated it now.
Thanks :) Just PMed you as well. Much obliged again! :D
Anytime! Glad to help a fellow writer!  Just sent you one back!
That was the smoothest, most professional email I have ever seen. :)
And you didn't even send me a request for a penpal yet!  Are you just trying to take advantage of me here? :P
I'm more like trying to take advantage of you haha! I will PM you tonight/tomorrow! Hope all goes well! :)
Great to hear!  And yes, let me make sure my address is correct!
I'm sending you an email now!
Cool! Let me know if you need anything else. :)
Will do, thank you again! :)  Would you be willing to help me in anyway outside of the prompts? You've really helped me write some amazing stories in the past. Would like to do the same now for other authors. Anyways, thank you once again. :)
Sure as long as it's constructive criticism and won't make me stop writing. I had a pretty rough time coming up with that prompt. In the end I decided to stay away from any real world events. If I have you, or someone else, write a story based on mine I'll link it here in r/fantheories.
