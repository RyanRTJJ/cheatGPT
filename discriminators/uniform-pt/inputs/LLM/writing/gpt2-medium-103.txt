 You decide that, even though you can't, you are going to change for them.  You start taking part in what can only be described as a miracle. Your mom is pregnant with your son's son. It seems like a simple, straightforward scenario: She's so pregnant that when she has a baby, his mom will be the one to care for him. She will raise your kid like she is she loves you and when her life is taking a turn for the worse, you'll know you are a lucky bastard. And boy were they right!  You've adopted your second daughter, and she looks just like you (who else?) and who can help you in just about any way you can think of? He has perfect marks, looks normal, acts well despite having a terrible past. You start living your life with confidence and an open heart. You live with your mom and father in your apartment but have one thing on the go: you're a writer for the network.  That was a really, really big deal that day. All day. It gets better when you get home a half an hour later from church and go over the script with your dad. You are, without a single mistake, trying to put words together that might convince him that you can do this. There are some characters that have to be added to your script just to make this possible.  It's not that simple, though; you have to remember that you can't just go to a guy at home and say "I have to write this".  You have to know that you have to put your name and resume behind a character just to be approved (and sometimes you will). It's really, really hard.  It's the least you can do given how stressful it
