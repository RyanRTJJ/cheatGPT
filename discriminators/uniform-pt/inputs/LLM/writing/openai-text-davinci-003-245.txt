They had grown to know one another inside and out. They had felt each other's joy, sorrow, fear, and pain. Despite the shared closeness, something had gone wrong and it was time to part ways. Though finalizing the divorce had been hard, they'd managed to stay friendly, being sure to show each other respect. 

Whenever they saw one another, the familiar spark was still there. It was so strong that it was sometimes hard to ignore the love they had for one another. 

One morning, they met in the park for their weekly coffee. After a pleasant chat about the current happenings in their lives, an awkward silence filled the air. Suddenly, the intensity of their connection became evident. Without a word, they simultaneously leaned towards each other. Their lips parted and they softly kissed. 

They soon parted, each realizing what had just happened. They looked into each other's eyes and it was obvious that they were still madly in love. That moment confirmed that divorcing hadn't changed the fact that their hearts and souls were still connected. 

Despite the fact that they were now divorced, the two former spouses knew they'd remain connected through their love. They'd never forget the intensity of the deep love that they had shared, and still shared, for one another.
