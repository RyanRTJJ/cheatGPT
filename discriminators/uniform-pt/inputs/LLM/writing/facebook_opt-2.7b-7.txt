  Edit: The basement is not accessible, there are secret passages though.
The story would be about him searching for his twin sister or something?
Yea that works. It's kinda hard to say without knowing what your story is.  But I would be tempted to say, his sister got killed. But he never knew that for sure, because he wasn't alive when she died.
I was thinking about it a bit more and I think this wouldn't make too much sense...   What if, as I said in the post, you were the only survivor?  In that case, it'd be easier to search the basement and find something like his journal, no?
Well, since he bought a house as his own family house, it would still make sense for him to go down there with a purpose. And if he knew his sister died, it would be easier to find something like his journal.  You could also have a vampire that is a sibling or best friend of the protagonist of the story with the same kind of role.
Hmm...   Anyways.  Good talk guys! I'm still going to throw this idea out there and go with it, haha.
So far, it's probably your best bet.  Good luck.
Thanks, man!  Good luck to you too! Hopefully it is what I was looking for, haha.
Do you mean it's what you were looking for but it's better, or it's what you have always wanted but you hadn't found it yet?
It's what I've always wanted. But I have no idea what's going to happen, and it's been a real learning experience.  I'll just see where it goes, haha.
