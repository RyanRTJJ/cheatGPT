 What is your plan? What do you do now that you are free of your alien prison?

Your plan is to live the life and die a natural death from old age. You've lived a long time, a great deal longer than any human has. You have the whole planet to yourself. There is no one to fight, so you can just let the years roll by on their own.

Life is good. There, I said it. Life is good, isn't it?

There is always the chance you'll be found.

It's been nearly fifty years since the Great Invasion. In those fifty years you've lost track of just how many people you've killed over the years. It's not that you're a heartless murderer, far from it. The deaths have been necessary. It's just if you had to kill to keep the world safe, how many of them did you really need to kill?

You spent your life as an enemy, someone to be fought and defeated. Over the years you've gotten much better at not having to kill anymore. Now you're an expert assassin who is called whenever a major case is on.

You just can't get enough.

You do not know why you are here. It is quite possible you were a human on your old planet that you were taken from before the invasion. Who knows why this happened? It did not start as a kidnapping or enslavement so no one knows why this was allowed to happen. But it's been a long time and no one is asking any questions.

If the old aliens knew how many humans you've killed, they certainly wouldn't be happy.

But you've never done anything wrong. Maybe someone will eventually ask why you're here but at this point it's just too late to ask questions.

The aliens never intended to keep you alive. You should be dead like everyone else. Instead you've been granted an exile of sorts. An odd privilege, yes, but it keeps things interesting.

That is, until the day
