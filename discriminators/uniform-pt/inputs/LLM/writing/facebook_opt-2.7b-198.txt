 (That's your job description.  Be creative.)  A group of people go to a haunted house during halloween, with the goal of being the last to live.    Edit: or whatever sounds fun. There was a story on here a while back but i never remember the prompt. You could look through the recent posts, or ask a friend. I was just thinking to write something today, but its after 11pm. I hope you have fun and let me know if you need any more help!
> A group of people go to a haunted house during halloween, with the goal of being the last to live  Sounds like it could be a scary story. Could turn out that they're trapped in a room with a man-eating ghost. You don't think it could go that far could you? I mean, they're already the last to be alive if it gets to the man eat-ghost part in less than a handful of hours.
I agree, the last to be alive part sounded like it could easily turn into a creepypasta. That's how those creepy stories get started anyway.   I'm still thinking though, what genre of story would you prefer it to be? Scary, thriller, horror, paranormal, etc.
I guess the story would just become part of this creepy tradition of not having people survive the haunted house? Which is how those scary stories start in the first place. But could it go further than that? I'm not sure. I'm sure the final sentence could be either one of those things. Maybe the final paragraph could be like you've just been asked if you can save one person. Of course you tell them, but you might make them do something you wouldn't want them to, or might kill you... or both.
Cool idea. I'll see what I can come up with, I'll edit this post if i decide to go for it!
