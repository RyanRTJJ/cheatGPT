Wisdom of the crowd: All my life, from the moment you got here to now, I have watched, experienced all the same people grow up, and what they all have in common is their fear of losing their self trust by not meeting expectations in the next life. It's hard to keep up with the changing pressures of having children, but sometimes you just don't get caught up. It's all selflessness and courage, so you don't have to deal with their emotions. You can work with just one person. If you can, you could create the same kind of person who would help you achieve your goal. Don't get overwhelmed by the pressure of not meeting the expectations.
Don't let your fear of losing control prevent you from succeeding. And don't get caught up in the shame that you're now carrying about as if you're making a mistake.

You may have been raised by a family who suffered and lived through some of the worst in their lives. The new, younger generation of people who grew up in their environment and had no idea they were different could only be happy with the change of their lives. Now, they're just being afraid to even
