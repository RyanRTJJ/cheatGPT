In the course of preparing for my talk on race, I've had many discussions with myself about football, about the black player that I've met, and about my feelings about my own career. I've thought about every question that I was going to ask at the end of the book, including in relation to the book's title: In the Long Shadow of Peyton Manning.

And I can't wait for a long, long conversation with myself, with this player, about racism in football.
