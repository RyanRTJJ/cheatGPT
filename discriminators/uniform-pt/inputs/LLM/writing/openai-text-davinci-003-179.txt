Once upon a time, there was a small town with a mysterious and spooky history. People were warned not to venture into the woods nearby, because it was said to be haunted by spooky scary skeletons.

Youthful curiosity led one brave teenager to take a shortcut through the woods on her way home from school. As she walked, she began to become more and more uneasy, and felt as if she was being watched.

The feeling grew and intensified the further she traveled, until she heard an unnatural rattling noise coming from the dense trees around her.

She realized with a start that it was not the wind, but something much more sinister. Looking down, she saw bones scattered on the ground, skeletons dressed in tattered clothing, their eyes hollow and lifeless.

She stumbled back in terror and nearly screamed, but managed to control herself just in time. Gathering her wits, she cautiously approached the front one, studying it in the fading daylight.

It was dressed in a clown suit, with a porcelain mask affixed to its forehead and something oddly familiar about its skeletal face.

Suddenly, a voice cut through the silence, booming out from the trees.

"Welcome to our final resting place, curious traveler," it said. Fearful and trembling, the girl took a step back, not sure of what the voice meant.

But then, from the depths of the trees, a group of children appeared, all dressed in matching costumes and masks. The girl suddenly recognized the skeleton in front of her to be the same as the others.

A procession of children along with the spooky scary skeletons slowly made their way out of the woods, as if going to a secret graveyard.
