John had always been a bit of a zombie fan. He’d spend countless hours watching zombie movies and reading zombie books, and he longed to experience the undead himself. So, on one fateful October night, he decided to take matters into his own hands.

John drove to the graveyard at the outskirts of town and, using a shovel and a spade, he dug up a freshly buried corpse. He took the corpse to a nearby cemetery and, following an ancient ritual, he resurrected the dead. Within moments, the corpse was transformed into a zombie, ready to obey John’s every command. 

As John watched in horror, the zombie set off into the night, attacking and devouring anyone it encountered. John followed the zombie, horrified but unable to do anything about it. He watched in horror for hours as his zombie body tore through the town. 

Then, as the sun rose, John died. It happened so quickly he didn’t even have time to reflect on his actions. All he knew was that he was now a ghost, forever trapped in the shadow of his own undead form. From then on, John followed himself around, watching in horror as he devoured one victim after another. And, no matter how hard he tried, John was never able to make the zombie stop. He was forever doomed to watch himself attack and eat people, unable to do a thing about it.
