Nina was a 10-year old girl living with her family in a small town. Growing up, Nina had always been an imaginative and creative child and had an especially strong connection to her vivid dreams. One day, she had a strange dream that seemed too real; in her dream, Nina was talking to someone she had never met before. The mysterious figure promised to be her friend no matter what, even if no one else believed in her. Nina flashed awake, suddenly realizing that this was no longer a dream--it was her imaginary friend standing before her.

At first, Nina was ecstatic to meet her friend-- she had always wanted one and now she finally had one! But then, without warning, the figure started to shape change as a bright, deep red light enveloped the room. In a booming voice it said, “I am Satan.” 

Nina was terrified and wanted to run away, but something inside her kept her still. Satan said that Nina was an incarnation of God, and that they had known each other since the beginning of time. 

Nina couldn't understand what Satan meant by this, and his words didn't make any sense. However, as time passed, Nina began to understand the truth of her spiritual self. She realized that her gift was her strength and her connection to the divine. 

Nina and Satan remained friends, as Nina grew to understand the power within her and the ability to manifest worlds with the power of her own mind. Although Nina is still only 10 years old, she is more powerful than she ever imagined. She will always remember the day she met the devil and was given the knowledge of her true power.
