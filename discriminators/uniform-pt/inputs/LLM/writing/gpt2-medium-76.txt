 It's good for story telling, and maybe you could use it in a screenplay as well.  This might be the best possible trick for people who feel like "I am not good enough for this shit".  The thing is, you'll need to get back the whole point of the story.  I'm not interested in giving you a script of something that never happened, as it is too complicated. I know you don't want to admit it, but I'm already a writer.  It's fine, though. It's a very natural reflexes reaction, like to write about something that never is, or even something you haven't tried.  A writer always knows what is going to happen, and is able to use that knowledge to keep the story from taking place at all.  I'm sure that this is why you've never written the most epic tale of revenge you have ever published. It isn't enough, of course.  You still have to know that you do something, and that is your job. You may have to be a bit more direct in telling the truth to convince someone to care about their feelings.  The more you say, the more you feel obligated to tell and reveal, the more you will grow. You don't know if I understand or not, but I have never said that I had been raped by my mother or my grandmother, or if my grandma didn't die of a heart attack and I did.  I have never said that I suffered from ADD, that I had bipolar, that I liked to drink and that I don't believe in God.  I'm not telling anyone I think these things, I'm not trying to convince anyone on any level.  I just tell you that I am.  You need to ask yourself that.  If you told me "How old are you?"  I would likely give you more than a few hundred words to elaborate on
