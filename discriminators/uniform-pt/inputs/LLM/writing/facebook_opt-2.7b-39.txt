  Edit: sorry, I got so caught up in the details of the story that I forgot what the prompt actually said. But thanks for reminding me... I'm on it now ;)
Heh. I'd actually forgotten about it until you mentioned it. It'd be pretty weird if I were writing a story about a story about a world ending that wasn't about the end of the world as we know it.  But seriously, I'm down to collaborate if that works. I have a story that might get you curious about what's coming. ;)
Okay, first off - I just submitted a story on here so you'll probably see it this morning and we can start collaborating right around then.       I wouldn't want anyone to think I'm cheating though haha. Maybe we can set up some rules and we go from there?
I know you don't actually want to cheat ;)  That being said, it'd probably be interesting to write about a world where we don't actually know anything. That said, if we had to write fiction (no matter what genre), what would we start with?
Oh no, definitely wouldn't cheat. Just a small stipulation for now as I'm looking for an idea - let's say the story takes place on a space station, and we're on the last of the resources they have and the story takes place over a few days.
I could run with that, if only to see what you came up with :)  My problem is that anything that could be described as the last of anything is about to be gone... the world has begun to break down, and the planet earth has begun to melt. I'm going to have to be creative.
My idea is kind of the last of humanity trying to keep going without any food, water, medicine, or weapons. We're surviving off of whatever we can scrounge from the planet and surviving a few days because the supplies are almost all gone.
How about your characters aren't just characters anymore, but real people who are left with
