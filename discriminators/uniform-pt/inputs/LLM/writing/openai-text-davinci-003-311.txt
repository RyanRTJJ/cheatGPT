It was difficult living in an abandoned nuclear storage facility. Especially being the only one living here. I have stayed behind for years, keeping watch to make sure that nothing remained inside these walls.

But one day I heard a strange noise coming from outside. I peered out the window to see a group of kids, who called themselves "urban explorers". They were like scavengers, looking around for anything they could find in the shadows of this forgotten place.

I knew immediately that I had to get them out of here, by any means necessary. After a few hours of careful negotiation, the kids were on their way. But they weren't gone long before I heard the noises again.

This time it was a larger group, this time they were inside the building! I scrambled around the facility, trying to find ways to keep them out.

After what seemed like ages, but only minutes in reality, I realized that the only way to get them out of the building was to frighten them. I made loud noises and waved my hands furiously, creating an eerie atmosphere.

The kids soon became scared and left quickly. It had taken a lot of effort but the facility was safe from the intruders. I had done my job. I was relieved, but also exhausted. I knew I had to remain vigilant and keep my watch, for I never knew when these kids would come back again.
