Day 1

This is it: my first day in exile. I cannot believe this is my life now. The thing I've feared for so long is here and I feel like I'm about to burst. I want to yell and scream, but my throat is too parched to make a sound. All I can do is sit in this desolate wilderness and wonder when, if ever, I will be able to return home.

I came here alone, carrying nothing but the clothes on my back, and the weight of my ambitions. I know I must live out my sentence here and I am determined to do it with as much grace, dignity, and strength as possible. From this moment on, my only mission is to survive.

Day 20

Today marks my last day in exile. After twenty years spent living a solitary existence in the wild, I can’t believe I’m going home at long last. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so relieved, although I know my toughest tests are yet to come.

These past two decades have been harsh, but they’ve taught me how to be strong, brave and resourceful. I know these lessons will serve me well as I re-enter society and try to pick up where I left off. It will be an uphill battle, but I am determined to make the most of my second chance.
