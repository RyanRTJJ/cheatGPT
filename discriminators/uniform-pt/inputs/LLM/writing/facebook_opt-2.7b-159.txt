 How did you figure it out, what did you do, and what's the thing you did to get rid of it?
Also what's interesting is that since you're the only one in the world who has this ability, they can probably track your whereabouts
"We don't exactly need an explanation for him using it. He's a minor."
I like you, are you my boyfriend?
Yes.
Good to know, he's my boyfriend too!
I hope I'm not too late to claim him!
You are not too late, just tell him to send his keychain over
He already told me to give him one.
You'll never need another, because yours now matches his
He told me to tell you to send mine.
Tell him that he's the lucky one that got to be with one
I have three.
Two lucky two unlucky one.
I only get one.
You should call that number on the back of your card and tell them your situation
I called it, but I think the computer isn't even responding.
I'm sorry to hear that, what's your number?
I'm just having trouble getting a hold of my fianc√© and his fiance. They're really busy.
Is anything else wrong with your phone? Is it locked? Have you changed any of your recent settings? I'll figure it out
Oh, I'll just call him on his phone. He'll get it to me then.
Are you sure you don't want to set it up again? I made a mistake myself when I unlocked it
We solved it with my girlfriend doing the right things I guess. I'll have her call you right after she gets off work.
