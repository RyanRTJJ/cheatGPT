The war had been bloody and brutal. It was all so fast though.

The war had started the previous year. Everyone had known it was bound to occur. Everyone had known, but no-one wanted to believe the war would happen. Because of this, the first year of the war were all so quick for everyone involved. There was no time to prepare. There was no time to mourn. There was no time to feel anything. I would be feeling some of that in a few short decades. I was young and oblivious of what was to come.

It didn’t start on a clear horizon, though. It was foggy. I do not know why I remember that fog. Maybe my life will come as a fog someday. Maybe then, I can remember it clearly. One night, the fog lifted. A new battle broke out.

The war began. It was all over just moments later. I don’t know which of them were fighting, but I know that I was watching the battle on the streets. I saw the dead. I don’t know how I found out. Maybe I heard it, maybe I saw it. I knew that there would be more of those next year, and the next, and the years after that. I wanted the war to go away. I wanted the war to stop, but it never did go away. It changed into a blood feud.

The blood feud took a turn. The feud didn’t change into anything that I could fight. I didn’t know what to do to stop it, so I just became a coward. I tried to hide. I tried my hardest to hide, but I couldn’t hide from that war. There were people all around me every second of life. I had a job and stuff, but I was all alone. I had no one to talk to, no one to go home to at night, and no friends. I had a home now though, something I did not have.
