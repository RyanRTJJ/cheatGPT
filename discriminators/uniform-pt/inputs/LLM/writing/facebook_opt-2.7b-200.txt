 You're allowed to be as abstract or as concrete as you want. Be the villain without any redeeming qualities, the devil without morality, anything. Whatever helps you find your style.
My favorite part of the prompt was there was no right or wrong, so there was absolutely no character to write! I’m definitely going to try it out sometime. Thank you!! :)
No problem! I wrote a few stories for those prompts myself, they were all kind of different, but there's always potential for a really good story. Just make sure you don't have a character that is an omnibenevolent monster without a single redeeming quality and you're golden. :p  Good luck!
Thanks dude, I do appreciate it. That idea of my best friend just kinda wanting to take over the world is just awesome. This gives me a lot of ideas to think out. Thank you again!! :)
No problem! Good luck :D
It went over great. I put so much thought into it. I’m pretty much the writer I always wanted to be. :D
That's awesome! Great work. :D
Thank you! How did your story go? I was honestly surprised no one was talking about it, but now there are like, five other stories, so what do I know?
It's on reddit the front page already
Lmao, well. The first story I read was actually the one I wrote lol
Ahhh, lol. I thought that was another one of yours lol
Yeah lol. The one I was going to write that one, but I needed to know which I was going to write haha so. I was actually thinking of changing the name, but it’s pretty attached to its own story, and I don’t wanna butcher the name haha.
Right. I was wondering cuz of how you said it that you hadn't written it yet. My bad, lol
Ahhh haha yeah. I wrote it as a sort of a one and a half shot, and the second part is still a few days off haha
