A word I would like to mention from my personal point of view is that I was working at one point as an employee of a major magazine, where not only were the questions answered, but a lot of the articles were well written. My first assignment involved a piece on gunpowder by the editorial writer John Goguen entitled "Rockets in Sand". The subject matter was fascinating â€” and for a time, I believed, I was dealing with some serious research material. But that was only half the story. It just didn't make sense to me that the magazine would let a journalist answer a question on the basis of some article he had written. I was quite angry when he realized that some newspapers had even refused interview requests in response to a magazine piece. I think it took someone with better editorial standards not to realize this or to know better. And I understand why he made that editorial decision a few years ago, and not today, when it still seems like journalists just don't know how to answer this question that we need answers to today.

As I read about this year's presidential debates this month for more than twenty years, and on Sunday, a recent episode of "Access Hollywood", it is clear that some journalists don't understand what constitutes a valid challenge to a current or prospective president. In my experience in covering this topic over the years, the majority of reporters and editors seem to really get it, and that's the last resort. If the reporter or editor is not prepared for the political challenges they are facing by the presidential candidate, that person is going to give way, at best, to a lame duck status quo.

This may sound like the classic "you can't kill people, but you might as well let
