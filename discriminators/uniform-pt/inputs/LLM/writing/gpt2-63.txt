This item, called "The Hunter", is sold on trade through merchant guild in the town of Narada and is available in Guild Wars, Cuckoo's Woods, and the Ruins of Narada; it is unique in that there isn't a single tradeable version available in the game. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- =============================================================================== * This item is not yet sold or is on sale until a story arc has been sold.
