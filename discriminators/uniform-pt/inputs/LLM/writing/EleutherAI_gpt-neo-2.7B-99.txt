Here are the rules:
1. There are a few Grim Reapers in your game world. They are the main antagonists and your primary source of information in your story. When they die, you, as their substitute, become the new Grim Reaper and must keep their secrets. You also have to decide if you will become a replacement or not. 
2. Each person you talk to (except a few random NPCs) can reveal information and reveal the identity of the Grim Reaper. This can mean something like saying a name or revealing something you can't talk about for certain, but who the Reaper is (who they are). If you give away their identity, you must also keep a secret about it, but it must be safe from being read by anyone but the Reaper himself, and may be worth a small amount of money to the party. 
3. You cannot allow anyone to discover or discuss your identity. 
4. You must have some idea of what the Reaper is, or they will come to suspect that you will tell them their identity. 
Example story: A friend of hers wants revenge against a man for a cruel action. He sends her a message saying someone murdered her lover and another person is keeping the crime a secret. The person who is keeping the story is a former colleague of the murdered man who is now the next Grim Reaper. Later the former colleague comes to the friend and says she wasn't the murderer either. She's the new Grim Reaper. Do you kill him? Why or why not? What do they call you when you are not the Grim Reaper?
