 Do I believe in heaven? Do I love being in heaven? Should we have more babies there? What if we were given an opportunity...(sigh) to have a bunch of extra babies?

If you think about it for 30 seconds, it's pretty obvious.  Our life and our happiness is tied up in a few things: how we see ourselves in the rest of the universe; how we view our neighbors; and how we see the whole universe.  We will only end up with the best possible lives, if we're willing to see the world through the lens of being able to do to others what we wish others would do to us.  It's no different than "paying" to "get into a better school".
We can think of ourselves as the "village" that we are in.  We can think of our neighbors as "the world".  We can think of the world as something that "needs" to be cared about.  Whatever the reason, we always try to balance the world's needs with our own.
We may do this by giving money or helping the stranger, without thinking about what other people will do with that money or what other people will do with that extra helper.  It doesn't matter if it's something that "sucks", just do it.  And as long as we live within the scope of our self-imposed limits, we will be happy and free from misery (and other things).  We will enjoy life and love, and we will understand why the world is as it is.  It's this understanding that will teach us how to best approach the world and others, and it's this "seeing the world" that will teach
