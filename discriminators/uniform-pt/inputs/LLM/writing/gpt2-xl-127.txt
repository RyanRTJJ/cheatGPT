Hey guys! I've been having a little bit of a life issue which I'm sure many people are going through. I've had depression my whole life (but was able to get better after college), I got diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder a few years ago. I have been on multiple medications, both for mental health and anxiety and it just has been killing me to not be able to function. I've been on different antidepressants; Seroquel has been my go-to medication for the past few months. I've tried a plethora of various anti-depressants over the years. My issue is that I'm constantly sad; I feel like I'm constantly in a downward spiral which has been killing me. I've been going through one heck of a depression but also a manic depressive manic. I've even tried a lot of psychotropic drugs when things have reached a breaking point; I was on Prozac and a lot of other meds before that. My mental health has gotten so bad that now I simply cannot function (which has been causing many physical problems as well but for various other reasons). Most days my mood is so low, I'd rather just eat cookies than work any of the above! This is where you guys come in; with all the abuse being done to my mental state, I am in no shape to cope. I'm a freelance writer and this is the first thing I do every morning. My goal is to go through my day for the article I am about to write (about my experience), then give you some feedback on how I've gone with it. This is going to be a long, difficult process so please respond with just as much passion and effort as I have in the past. I am so scared to write this, but if you want to help me
