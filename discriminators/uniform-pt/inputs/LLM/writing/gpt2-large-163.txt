Stories with a hero with wings

Femmefest (a comedy written by Matt Forney, directed by Jason Mantzoukas, star: Melissa Leo, writer and star Rachel Brosnahan) tells the true story of a young woman who comes across a girl's pet bird who is also one of the world's most powerful birds. When the woman tries to kill the child, she is attacked by an angry bird with wings, and the hero steps on the bird's head to save him. The hero wins the big game. Why? Because he is a huge red bull. This story also tells the hero's parents their son's name. The story then turns to the bird and why he is so powerful, but the narrator doesn't explain what the title of the story also means.

When you're a teenager, you tend to buy into pop-culture tropes from your favorite comic books, movies, and TV shows, and it becomes easy to become cynical and pessimistic about the world around you. Sometimes it's your own fault, other times you're just a kid. Whatever it is, your parents should have taught you about the many reasons why hero characters are so beloved and why heroics are so rewarding. From the comic book hero Captain America, to Star Wars (with Darth Vader), to the Star Wars Expanded Universe (with Kylo Ren), to Jor-El on Star Wars: The Original Trilogy, these stories show both sides of the story. I've already read the first book, but if you're interested in more ideas, you can check out the collection "Astonishing X-Men." This book includes a few other books and a handful of short fiction stories from John Byrne, John Layman, Chris Claremont, and others to inspire you.

The next time you're reading a book, or you're stuck on a train, give these books a read. You never know.
