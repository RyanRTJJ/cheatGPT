Lina had been curious about her ancestry for as long as she could remember. Most of her family was of European descent and while that was interesting, she was sure there were more exciting and exotic stories lying just beyond her knowledge. So, she decided to take a DNA test and see what it revealed. 

The kit came in the mail and Lina followed the instructions to send away a cheek swab. Weeks passed and she anxiously awaited the results. When the email came back, her first instinct was to squeal with excitement. The results were 100% Neanderthal. 

For Lina, this was a shocking yet satisfying result. She was now able to connect her life to a distant past that was older than her imagination could ever have stretched. She was excited to learn more about Neanderthals and their lifestyle, and what kind of impact this knowledge would have on her life going forward. 

She spent the next few weeks researching and reading all she could about Neanderthals and their culture. Lina found it absolutely fascinating to learn about how they lived, and the structure of their society. This newfound knowledge gave her a sense of pride and connection with her ancestors, and when she spoke about her results with her family, she was met with awe and admiration. 

Lina now had a new perspective on her history and family. It was like a piece of an ancient puzzle had just been solved. She was fascinated to learn more and uncover her Neanderthal roots. It was an experience she would never forget.
