Once upon a time, a man found himself standing in front of three grand doors. Each one was a different color. The man was awestruck. He couldn't believe his eyes.

Suddenly, a voice spoke from the sky. It said, "You have arrived at the Gates of Destiny! Behind each door lies a reward. Choose wisely. You may select only one door."

The man looked at the first door -- it was a bright yellow, with a symbol of eternal happiness etched onto its surface.

The second door was a deep blue, with a symbol of infinite knowledge engraved into its surface.

The third door was jet black, and God had never opened it.

The man thought for a moment and then decided to open the first door. When he did, a beautiful light filled the room and birds began to sing. He stepped in and felt at peace.

The man had chosen the door of eternal happiness.

As he started to turn away from the other two doors, a voice spoke to him again. It said, "Your destiny does not end here. To truly find your way, you must open the third door."

The man was startled by this. He paused for a moment and then decided to take the risk. He opened the black door and what he saw stunned him.

Inside was an entire universe. It was filled with stars, planets and galaxies. He stepped inside and felt a profound sense of awe. He knew he had found the ultimate knowledge, and the power to create his own destiny.

The man had opened the door of infinite knowledge.

From that day forward, he used his knowledge to help others, and he shared his wisdom with the world.
