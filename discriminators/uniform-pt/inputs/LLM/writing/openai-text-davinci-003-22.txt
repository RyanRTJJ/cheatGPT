Alexander sighed and looked around. It had been two years since he'd declared independence from home, but he'd finally had to admit that it just wasn't working out. He'd been offered a place here, and it wasn't home, but he'd take it.

He stepped in, carrying his bag. It was a small place, but it had character. He could see a future here. He'd get a job, and start to build his future.

He took a deep breath, and made himself a promise. This was his new home, and he was going to make the most of it. He was going to build something special and make the most of life here.

Alexander opened his bag and unpacked his few possessions. He was ready to start fresh. He had a plan, and it was time to get to work.

For the first time in a long time, Alexander felt a sense of peace and hope settle over him. He was ready to start his new life.
