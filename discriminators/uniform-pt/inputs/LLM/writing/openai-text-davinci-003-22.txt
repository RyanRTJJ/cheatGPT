My name is Ellie and I'm sixteen years old from the United Kingdom. Growing up I always loved watching a show called 'The Adventures of Tom and Ben'. It was a fun and silly show, about two best friends going on all sorts of adventures filled with mystery and humour.

Recently, it’s been reported of an outbreak of the zombie virus in Europe. My family and I were directed to take shelter in our local school. As we secured ourselves there, I began to think about my beloved TV show. What would Tom and Ben do in this situation?

We all prepared for the worst, but then something amazing started to happen, out of nowhere Tom and Ben appeared. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Tom shouted, “It’s time to fight for our survival!” and with that, he pulled out a trusty slingshot and a bow and arrow.

The pair knew what to do in this zombie apocalypse and we followed their lead. They taught us all how to fight the zombies and how to use different weapons and strategies. We eventually formed a group of survivors, and with Tom and Ben’s help, we became a formidable force.

We went from town to town, proclaiming the message of hope and freedom. We were fighting for a better tomorrow, and that’s when I realised why I had loved the show so much; even if it is just a silly TV show, the moral of the story is still the same.

Thanks to the courage, strength and determination of the 'The Adventures of Tom and Ben' I was able to see the end of the zombie apocalypse.
