She walked in circles around her house trying to find a way out, though it seemed that no matter where she went there was always a door blocking her path. The walls seemed to move and change their shape, and the furniture that seemed to have not been moved for ages seemed to mock her with the knowledge that she was stuck in this forever-changing house. She had been searching for answers for days, but all she seemed to find were more questions.

She found herself in the kitchen, the place she had spent countless hours searching for a way out. But every drawer she opened, every corner she turned, ended with the same resultâ€” nothing. Nothing but the same endless search for a way out.

As she continued her journey through the house, she wondered if she'd ever find a way out. Nothing seemed to be working, and she felt as though this house was a prison that she had been sentenced to. She thought to herself that if she could just find the answer, the key to escaping this place, then her life could be lived as it should. 

Suddenly, she opened a door that she had never seen before and stepped inside. To her surprise, it was an exit. She walked out of the house, breathing a sigh of relief at being freed from her prison. A new journey awaited her, and she was determined to make the most of it.
