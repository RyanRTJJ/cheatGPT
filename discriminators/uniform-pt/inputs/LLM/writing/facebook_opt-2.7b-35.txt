   What did you come up with? Why not include a prompt for another situation that you think may come up?
I haven't actually thought of that one in a bit, I definitely will next time. Thank you! :)  I wrote this one because I couldn't think of anything else. I was just sitting next to my teacher talking about it yesterday after I was there for the AP Comp Sci class. We were talking about the whole "We have more jobs than people" thing, so I just tossed the idea into the conversation. We just kinda started throwing ideas around and I was like, "Well that's an original one, might as well write it!"
I love the idea of giving students a prompt and challenging them with it.   You're welcome. :) It's really fun to write about an idea that isn't necessarily what's happening on campus. I hope others appreciate it!
Well, thank you. I'll probably do this every once in a while until the year ends. :)
I'm looking forward to it. I'm sure /u/gustavsen has some great prompts for topics like that.
He's a good guy that Gustavsen. He's doing some awesome shit!
Is he a good guy now?
Yes very very! :D He's done so much for the school he's practically a god. And this coming from your principal? Who in the hell did he do?
He made the school *better* than it was *before!  What a man.
Don't even thank me; thanks goes to ALL The teachers. It helps even more when the principal does a lot, too. It helps keep the faculty focused, on the job, and making sure the classes are doing what they should with the time they're given! It's hard work, but it's worth it...
I do work with the faculty, so you're right. The problem is that sometimes the teachers aren't around to take good care of students, but it's better than nothing.
Yeah. I'm lucky. I teach at a high school, so I'm lucky to have my principal take the things
