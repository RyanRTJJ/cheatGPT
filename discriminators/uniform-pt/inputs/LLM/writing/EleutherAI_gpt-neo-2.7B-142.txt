 The only problem is that they don't speak English, and the Earth is speaking a foreign language. What will they say? Write a story that incorporates our Earth's first contact with aliens, but without making the aliens look like English speakers. You can use any aliens the story doesn't have in it.

2. There's a group of us and they need a place to live, so we're all going to leave our homes. If their home is too small, it's fine; if it's too big it isn't. When we go, we'll pick our houses to leave by lottery. (You just don't know which is which. You'll probably know when you get there.) No one else can take your place--there must be houses available. The one thing this doesn't matter is whether you choose them all or some of them, and you can write the second part of "there is no room for every one except one" in two different ways:

a. Write a story that has a character (any character, except mine, and maybe others) living in the group of houses we'll meet at the end of this story. Or make up a story in which other characters live in other houses, or make up a story in which no character lives in houses at all. Then, if you like, show your fictional version of the character.

b. Or, if you prefer, you can write out all the houses you'd like to live in by yourself. For example, you could imagine "two houses" that you could live in, and "ten houses" in which you could live. You can also describe the different numbers: "six houses" and "eleven houses."

3. There are some "rules" of the house and town. There's a person in charge of the group (you can give her a name but not tell anyone else). She's called "Rosa." She tells you (it seems) when the lottery will be held and how you can enter it (by showing up on your door-knocker).
