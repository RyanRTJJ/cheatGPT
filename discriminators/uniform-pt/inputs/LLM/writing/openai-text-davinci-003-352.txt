Once upon a time, there was an angel who had always deserved the utmost respect and admiration. She was a guardian angel, overseeing the mortals who walked the earth, and it was her job to protect them, guide them on their paths, and keep them safe. She adored her work and was highly regarded for her pure and innocent nature, as well as her wise counsel.

But all that changed one fateful day when a small mistake she had made in her lifetime had been discovered, and now, both Heaven and Hell had decided to exile her. She was now forbidden to be involved in any kind of mortal affairs, neither to protect them nor to guide them.

The angel was heartsick and utterly devastated, for she could no longer perform the work and watch over the mortals whom she cherished above all else. But despite her sadness, she vowed to remain true and devoted to her purpose, even if she could no longer fulfill it in the same way.

So, the angel chose to wander the earth, seeking out those who were in need of a friend and a compassionate ear, and silently offering her own kind of comfort and guidance. She never expected anything in return, but her selfless acts were enough to bring a glimmer of hope to those despairing souls whom she encountered.

For a long time, the angel couldn't find contentment in anything, but through the love and acceptance of a few souls she befriended, the angel was able to find a way to go on. And although she was no longer welcomed in Heaven or Hell, the angel was eventually able to find her own place in this world, and in the hearts of many.
