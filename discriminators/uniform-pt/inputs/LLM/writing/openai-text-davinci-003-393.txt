The elevator doors opened, and she stepped into the small box filled with mirrors. She felt an instant sense of security, but also something else—loneliness. She had been traveling alone for so long and was desperate for something, anything, to break the monotony.

The doors closed and the elevator began to move downwards. She glanced up at the blinking floor numbers, each marking a tiny milestone in her journey. She gazed at her reflection in the mirror, seeing herself—her long blonde hair, her pale blue eyes, and the soft curves of her body—in a whole new light for the first time in what seemed like forever.

Suddenly, the elevator jolted to a stop. She heard a light buzzing, the sound of someone else joining the ride. She turned to see a tall, broad-shouldered man standing by her side.

He smiled somewhat nervously, and held out his hand. “Hi,” he said. “I know it’s kind of silly, but I just had to say hello. I’m Jack.”

She smiled back at him and shook his hand. For the first time in a long while, she felt alive.

The elevator door opened and they shared an unsure glance. It was time to go. She stepped out, and looked back at him before the doors closed. She waved, and he waved back.

The elevator began to move downwards again. She felt a sudden sense of peace. Although it had only been the span of a single elevator ride, she had made a connection that felt like it would last forever.
