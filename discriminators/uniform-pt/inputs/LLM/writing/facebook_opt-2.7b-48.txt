 I'd love to hear stories about where you thought you were gonna go, where you got to in life, what you did with your life.
The prompt is great, but also think about what a poor choice by the universe you are being given. "Every person" lol. Not to discourage you tho! Go for it.
I agree.  I'm just trying to help OP find what their unique 'thing' was.  If I could change the universe with my one action, I'd choose that for sure.  That would allow everyone to accomplish something really cool on their terms.  I'm just looking for stories of it :P
I think it's awesome that you think this is a cool idea but I don't think it should be the answer for OP. He needs time to figure out what is really important to him and just be thankful for the opportunities that have come his way and live in the moment with gratitude for his family and loved ones.  Plus if OP starts thinking about how he's different from everyone else, he's going to start losing it. Just think of it like a challenge to be overcome. I love this idea though and I hope OP takes it to heart :)
I don't see it as a question that OP has to answer.  I think this is a good prompt because it has many dimensions to it and would allow OP to answer different questions about his life.  OP could find some small piece of meaning in it, even if it's not at its core a question about himself.  That's all I want.  And thanks, maybe I'm over thinking it a bit :)
I think you're over-thinking it a little :) It's very cool to think about though.
Yeah, I just hope it was good.  Maybe I over thought it too..
