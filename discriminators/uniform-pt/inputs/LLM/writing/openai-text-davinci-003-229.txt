Dear Ma,

I know I've said this many times before, but I'll say it again, I love you. I can never find the right words to express how much I truly love you, how much you mean to me, and how much I'll miss you.

As much as I miss home, I am still here in the trenches of WW1. The war is still raging on, and I no longer believe it will ever end. I have witnessed much in my time here, bloodshed and destruction beneath the blue sky, friendships and bonds through tragedy, and patriotism and courage on the battlefield. It is a much different world out here than what I thought I'd find. Though the destruction and destruction of war is sometimes unbearable, some good can come of it.

And so, I must leave you with this thought: love is the most powerful weapon in this world. It seems like love can truly conquer everything; we must never forget that. I've seen it here in the trenches, even amongst the enemies. Love, in any form, is worth more than any destruction war can produce. 

I want you to remember this as I step away from this battlefield. I want you to remember that I was brave, but more importantly, I want you to remember how much I love you.

I wish I could see you one last time, but I can't. All I can do is write you this letter, and hope that it will be enough.

Always and forever,

Your son, 

John
