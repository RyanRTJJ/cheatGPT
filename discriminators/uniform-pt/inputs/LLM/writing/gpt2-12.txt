 on 10 March 2010 by two friends of my (and my wife) girlfriend, I felt like we had been transported into a story and I wanted to make sure that I felt like at some point in my life I would want to talk. This time things changed dramatically when a stranger with just a phone rang my house to ask if anyone had seen us. I immediately grabbed my handbag and pulled out my credit card. They asked for a free ticket and said that I was a criminal but there was no way I was going to do anything illegal. I decided I needed to stay as long as possible to get them to return so that I could get another call. I drove to the police station so I could get a new ID as to get them to show me the information they were looking for.   But nothing happened because they couldn't get back to my wife or kids. In late 2000, I found out that the woman (another woman) had taken me to an upscale private school for the purpose of attending a party. It was an event that required me to wear a disguise for the sake of security and to avoid harassment by our classmate in class.
After a night of partying and dancing, I realized that there was something terribly wrong with me. I had been taking alcohol into my home from time to time.   And because I am a virgin, I had a very difficult time telling my friends and family. My friends and family thought they were going to just talk to them, and I couldn't make them listen.
But as soon as I felt I was being pulled around, a woman came towards me with a question: "Is that you?"
"No," I replied because I didn't know what to say or how to respond to her, and she started following me. I made sure to make sure she was not using my phone and only spoke for a short time.
This woman did know me and used a call to make a friend
