The child sat in the dark corner of the room, eyes wide and mouth agape as he watched the other children playing. He tried to join in, but it seemed that the others were avoiding him. He couldn't bring himself to make the first move. When the other children finally left, he was alone.

He brought his hands to his face, his small fingers tracing the tears running down his cheeks. His lips quivered as he muttered under his breath, "Am I a monster?"

The question lingered in his mind, playing back and forth until it reached a crescendo. He felt so different from everyone else and couldn't understand why. Was he less than everyone else? He just wanted to be like his friends, to be accepted and fit in.

Instead, he was alone, a pariah. He shivered in the dark corner, overwhelmed by the emotions flooding through him. He wanted to scream, to lash out, to break something and make the pain go away.

But he buried the emotions deep and simply whispered, "Am I a monster?" The words echoed off the walls of his mind, creating a never-ending loop of unanswered questions.

He finally succumbed to the pain, letting out a silent sob. Tears streaking down his face, he curled up into a ball, wrapping his arms around his knees in an effort to console himself. He lay there for hours, exhausted from the emotional roller coaster and not wanting to think anymore.

But the questions would not be silenced. "Am I a monster?" he asked in a barely audible whisper. The answer, for now, remained a mystery.
