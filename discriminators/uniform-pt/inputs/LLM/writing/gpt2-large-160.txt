 A secret organization stands in between you and complete and utter power.  Now you don't trust them and how do you find out what they're hiding?  You meet a boy named Max who loves saving others.  He washes his hands after a fight.  Then he goes into a cave.  In the cave are the two people who killed Max and the two people who helped them with magic.  You meet all these people - and they all have similar powers - and see the whole of your future unfold!

I'm a big fan of the genre, but I've been a big fan of comics since I was born.  My favorite books include Marvel Comics and DC Comics.  I'm not a huge fan of superheroes, but my favorite is Captain America.  I also love Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy.  A large part of the success I've had in recent months was thanks to the internet.  We're fortunate to have the entire world at our fingertips.  The success of Marvel and DC's properties has gone up a level. We now have something to share from every genre.  Not only could we see all of the different stories we could tell, but now we can explore how our culture interacts with these stories and the ways in which that might change what we call the heroes and their values.
This story has no specific superhero and does not contain any super powers.
