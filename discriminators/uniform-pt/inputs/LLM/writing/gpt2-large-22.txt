_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ If you can understand what I mean by "fantasy," then the story will be easier to understand. This is an interactive text adventure. There's only so much a player can do to change this world at will, and the world is slowly losing its will to resist. At every turn of the game, you can change the future, even the players themselves. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ An interactive text adventure story based on "Home" by William Gibson. This was written to be easy to understand, but still leave room for the player to build their own story as he delves deeper. This story requires no computer to be created to play but can be run on any computer that can display MS Office and Word. The story is written in the form of a series of letters to one's parents, sent directly from the characters in the game. These letters are both written in what they think is a traditional style and are written by multiple characters. (It is my hope to expand these to be able to be read in their native mediums, as well.) _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ "Home" is a text adventure story by William G. Moore. This is a very fun game to play. I recommend it for anyone that enjoys a good read. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ "A Place Beyond" is a story written in HTML code. The game is based on the short story "The Wind in the Willows" by Kenneth Grahame. This is a story about life in a strange land. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I created this story to challenge you. Take the challenge and put your hand to work, crafting your own story. If you feel you can bring the story to life however you can, use this as inspiration. If you want to learn something new, it must be in this game. You will find information for those of you who enjoy reading. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This is a work in progress, so there may be bugs. But if there are and you can fix them, I am happy to add a new version. To the right of
