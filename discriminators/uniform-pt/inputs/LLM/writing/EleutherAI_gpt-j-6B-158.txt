 
For example --  
A watch that doesn't work

The person who owns the watch wears it every day as they wait and wait for something.

You know the next day will be the same.
You wake up in the same bed with the same sheets. You walk the same sidewalk until you get to school again. But today will be different. Today you think that maybe something good will happen. Maybe something will change. Maybe, today will be different from the next day. Maybe today there will be an accident or a fire. Just maybe something terrible will happen today. Maybe something will happen today and that will mean that today is different. Not just you and everyone who is like you get to wake up every day in a boring world. Because no matter what happens today is different from the day before. It's just another day that will not matter to another one. Tomorrow will be another day that will follow.
You think back to when you first woke up that morning. You never even thought something might happen today because you are a very boring person. You were content with living in the same room every day. At least there were no windows so you never saw it. You never had a birthday because you woke up every day without a day like the ones that lived their birthdays. You don't think that you will ever live outside of a room or a door. You think back to the first time a door ever opened. Because for you it opens. You will never see a door open another time. Not unless your body is inside that door and then that door opens. You don't see doors open because you never walk. You never ride the bus. You never cross the street. You never learn what is an emergency. So for you life is always happening inside your room.  But this will not be your life when you grow up. Your life will not just be happening
