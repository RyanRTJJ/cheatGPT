____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ In the late 19th century, a group of British astronomers began trying to develop a practical instrument for measuring the Sun's rotation and to find astronomical references, such as stars, in the Earth's orbit. They settled on the idea of a gyroscope, which could be attached to an apparatus built into a ship. One of their ideas, that of using the earth's spin to calculate its orbit, was put into motion by the British astronomer Edward Allen. While he was experimenting with this idea aboard the ship Beagle in 1897, his gyroscope went out of control at about a hundred miles per hour. This put the Beagle under heavy stress, and the ship sailed dangerously close to the equator, where it sank within hours of its launch. Edward Allen and his crew lost all their instruments, but survived. Some speculated that he may have suffered an allergic reaction to the gyroscope, which caused severe dermatitis.

By finding that the gyroscope went in the same direction it was supposed to, Tyndall believed he had isolated the most probable cause of the gyroscope's malfunctions. This was exactly the kind of "solutionism" that was becoming popular, and was making its way into physics and astronomy at the time. Tyndall's observations showed that the gyroscope didn't rotate with the earth's orbital axis, and also that it had a circular orbit, rather than a plane one. When combined with Tyndall's theory, it was revealed that the gyroscope's malfunction had almost certainly been caused by something else -- something like a spinning mass
