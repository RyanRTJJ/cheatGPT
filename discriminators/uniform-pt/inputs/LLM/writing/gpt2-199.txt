 Make every mistake, be careful not to mess up your secret Santa card or make it look "brave." This should come as no surprise to your regular Santa.  As a result, you can expect to find more of my Santa creations soon. Go out and be a good boy, or better yet, you can let an angry, unhappy Stranger get in and get your whole Santa's heart to fire. Also, don't forget to show a picture of your Santa in action while you do so. It might not look so adorable (I know I've never taken the guesswork out of the picture, so it's probably not what you expect) but if you don't think you're gonna get to see your Santa at all, don't worry. You'll get to find more Christmas gifts and be happy as hell. As a bonus, if you find yourself in a situation where no one is playing by your rules, you can have the Stranger take a picture of you with that Santa for him and let it all be like "oh, my Santa, you saved us just before Christmas." Not bad, right? At that point, you may decide to go for a nice day of activities (like playing fetch or a quick picnicking game) as opposed to the usual boring, repetitive routines of Santa's routine (who doesn't love some awesome toys and decorations that look like I'm going for a photo shoot?). So, on to your gift cards and gifts.

So this is where I am getting up early to find these, my secret Santa gifts! So, here you
