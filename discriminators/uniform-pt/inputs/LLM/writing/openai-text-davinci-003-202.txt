The midnight sky was dusted with glimmering stars that provided just enough light to help guide my way. My strides were long and deliberate as I walked, lost in a cloud of thoughts, questions, and contemplation. 

I had a lot to think about. With the stress of my upcoming exams, the emotional roller coaster I was currently on, and the practice for my sport that seemed to consume my every waking moment - I was exhausted. I was tired of it all and, in this moment, I desperately needed a break.

I stepped off the sidewalk and onto the grass, taking a few deep inhales and exhales to clear my mind. I looked around, noticing the crickets, the cicadas, the way the grass tickled my feet, and the slight chill in the air. For the first time in a while, I was able to take in the world around me, to appreciate the beauty of it all. 

Soon, my steps carried me farther away - each one providing me with clarity and peace. I was taking a break from reality and, for a moment in time, I was no longer bound by the constraints of everything else. I was simply me, engulfed in this midnight walk, and the conversations I had with myself and the night sky.
