Chapter 1: Welcome To Christmas - Part 1

Christmas was the best.

And now that we’re here, I’m sure you’re asking yourself, Who cares? When I first moved to this little town of my own accord, I always wondered, Why can’t we live a normal life like normal people in a normal town can? Then, I remember that my mother, who actually had it all together, reminded me: ‘If I could live your life, I would’. 

My mother took our family back to the city after my brother and I were born, so that we would have a better chance of being noticed more. We had a whole new life. We had no family members to visit and no relatives to help with the move. I had no friends. All because I wasn’t good enough. I couldn’t make my parents proud and I felt stuck. 

I had no choice but to return to that little town in which my life was no longer valued. In fact, I’m not even sure if my mother believed in me. I was probably the first kid in the family to get rejected. I’m sure my parents thought about putting me away for good. I’m sure they thought about locking me up until I changed. Maybe they did, but that didn’t stop me from coming back. I was a big, fat little kid that never let anything get to me. Now I can tell you the same, but in a different form.

‘Welcome to Christmas”

I was a child in a large city at that very time. That one Christmas, my whole family was given such a warm welcome. The air was thick with the smells of the delicious, delicious food and the sounds of the beautiful Christmas carols. We had food on our plates, lots of sweet and delicious things to eat
