The "Dangerous Kids" at school have come down with the "Cute-and-Touched Syndrome, and most of them have fallen into complete fits of giggles and giggles. It's as if they can't really be trusted, and it's a dangerous game to play with them. You're no different- all you want to do is find some way to get out of this one without blowing your cover, or causing a mass panic. But how? If what you've observed is true, then what do you do to try to find out? Written by: A.S. Byerley (http://www.byerley.net) Art and Writing: S.L.

Hey Everyone! Now that we've completed our "Sorcerers and Sorceresses" line, I'm going to start working on two new classes, just to get some new blood from the players. So look for some more new content that's going to get released next week! We'll be working mostly on "The Heroes of Fable" this week, as this is where we'll be releasing a class for everyone to play. I don't have a firm idea yet, but it'll probably be something like the Witch type- a little bit of a thief, a little bit of a warrior, etc. We should have more information to show for the Witch next week, as I should have a couple more things in store for those who want to play Witch. It'll probably also have a few specializations for the class, though we'll see. Anyway, I love seeing the players' faces when they see it- every now and then I'll look around a room and see how everyone else is doing, and how excited they get when they find the new classes! ------------------------------------------------------------------------
