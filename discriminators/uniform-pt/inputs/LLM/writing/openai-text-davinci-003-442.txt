The alarm clock buzzed loudly as the sunrays filled the otherwise dark room. It was 4:30 in the morning and Mark groggily got up to get ready for work. He stumbled out of bed and dragged himself to the bathroom where he quickly showered and got dressed.

Mark had been running late to work for the past few weeks and, today was no different. He checked the time and realized he was already running behind. He rushed out of the house, determined to make it to the office on time.

As he made his way to work, Mark couldn't help but notice the peacefulness of the city at this early hour. The streets were empty and the air had a certain stillness to it that was calming. In the distance, the sun was beginning to rise, casting a warm orange glow across the skyline.

The sight was so captivating that it made Mark pause and take it all in. In that moment, everything felt almost eerily perfect. The anxiety and stress of the day melted away and, for the first time in a while, Mark felt at peace.

As he stood there, taking in the beauty of the sunrise, he realized that no matter how hard the day would be, or how challenging his job, this one moment in time was enough motivation to make him want to keep pushing forward.

He made it to work on time and, for the rest of the day, Mark kept thinking back to that moment. In that one moment in time, his cares and worries melted away and he was able to take a step back and appreciate the beauty of the world that was around him.
