 She knew the truth.  They had done it.  She had to do justice to this moment.  She had to finish with a smile.
Good one that works, however, I think this is all about the first moment.  You can't have a full-scale story without it... It takes a while..
Well, good thing I wrote a prompt with a beginning.  Cheers.  I would like to write about how your characters react after they know the truth - you may get some ideas.
If you like that particular one, maybe you could try /r/writingprompts? I love writing prompts. Always some great ones. You should also check out /r/writing, i just found it recently.
Yes, but I have no idea what to write.  In all seriousness, this isn't the right sub.  It's not for writing short stories, or in any way related to a book.  We love reading short stories here.
I'm sorry, I didn't know. Could you send me some examples of what /r/writing is about?
Mostly people just talking about writing.  But it's not a default.  It's kind of weird to post your own, but you can if you want.
Thanks for letting me know about it. I will definitely try to write something soon.
Np.  Good luck with your creativity!  This sub needs more people!
I agree with you. I think it's one of the best groups out there, and I hope you continue to be active there!
Thanks.  I'm going to check it out now.  I love reading other people's stories.  I had a teacher a long time ago who encouraged us to get involved in writing and I just never gave it a try, but now I've decided that 2012 is the year!
I definitely agree with that! We should create some sort of writing day - I would very much like that too.
