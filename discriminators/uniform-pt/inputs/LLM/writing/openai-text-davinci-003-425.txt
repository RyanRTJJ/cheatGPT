It was an ordinary day in 1945, but it was set to be anything but ordinary. For years, the name of Adolf Hitler had been a name people spoke with a combination of reverence and fear, depending on their political leaning. Today, though, it would be the day when all of that would change.

The Allied armies, bolstered by their success in Germany, had pushed the Nazi forces back all the way to a small bunker in the foothills of the Alps. There, remaining members of the Third Reich had gathered to make their final stand in a desperate bid to survive the inevitable Allied victory.

Inside the bunker, the atmosphere was tense. Hitler had grown more and more paranoid over the weeks as the walls of his fortress had been breached. He had slowly withdrawn further and further into himself and his inner circle had become ever more worried about his state of mind.

Finally, it was time. On April 30th, Hitler addressed his remaining troops and declared that he was going to commit suicide to avoid the shame of capture. In a thick and shaky voice, he spoke the words “Mein Fuehrer” for the last time before pulling a pistol from his coat and shooting himself in the head. 

The light inside the bunker died with him, to be replaced by a darkness that seemed to linger for years. The name of Adolf Hitler had been finally and irrevocably spoken for the last time.
