 What the most epic/crazy feat of human achievement  "How good your life is now vs when you were a child" : What is something you love that you didn't love back then? If it's a good thing, why don't you like/love it now?

I think there's already an /r/*diet*/ red bull subreddit,   It's for the real ones, not for the ones that are more like candy.

What are you doing for your weight loss program?

You asked if i went down to the corner store for weight loss program.  I work out a lot, but when I want to lose some pounds I go to the local gas station and eat a burger with a large fry.
This is a common misconception. A man who exercises is a MAN. What you are thinking
