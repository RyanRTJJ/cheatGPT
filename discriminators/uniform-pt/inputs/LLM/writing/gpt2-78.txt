A young female voice says that this is not a story, however I wanted to try and make a real story for you, so I figured I would suggest some new concepts and some new things to show you what I believe to be the best stories in the world. You may notice that for this prompt I didn't use any pronouns at all as I know that a young woman can have different ways of thinking about being female. I would rather just say "I have a name". You might also notice that the "c" is used to indicate female voice.

For those who think it's too far gone (they may be right) I was always in awe of the concept of this prompt (like I am of all the characters) so I thought I'd create a simple yet functional, and hopefully free, blog that we would all make. It will help you stay up to date with what's going on as soon as the next prompt comes together.

I've been a little impatient with this prompt since it starts almost 2 years old this past February! I am so excited it's coming.
