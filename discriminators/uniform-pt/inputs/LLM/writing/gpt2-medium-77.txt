Â I'm pretty certain that, if one Google search for "go outside" fails, one will never look for, say, Google.googledoogle.gov...
And this is just google. Googles are weird. I'll save you from having to figure it out, but let's face it... Google isn't cool anymore. And why exactly is that?
In my experience, that's because, in the early 90s, Google didn't seem all that excited about the Internet at the time.

But in the decade since, Google has gone from being an all-consuming monster on demand, to an extremely popular startup that makes most of its money in ads, and has even established a position as a media company.
I've spoken to several people at the company myself lately about Google's approach to technology, and how their expectations were, well, completely at odds with most people in Silicon Valley. When I was in college in the late 80s, Google was a pretty crazy company, and many people were probably saying things like this all the time... Google was one of the biggest media empire in the world.
Google is crazy, that's why. The company grew fast in the 80s and 90s, becoming the country's biggest Internet company.

(The example Google uses is Google Books, which it also did in-home teaching of the content of course.) Then as recently as 2014, Google was clearly the most
