Edwin had a peculiar habit, one he kept hidden away and only enjoyed when no one was around. Whenever he was alone and in the privacy of his own home, he walked, ran, and even danced - all sideways. Every step back he would take would take him a year back in time, and every step forward sent him a year into the future.

For the past few years, he had been perfecting his ability to keep himself in the present. But little did he know, his parents had taken notice of his not-so-secret hobby and had become determined to rid him of it.

With each conversation, they would demand he face forward, and each attempt at a sideways skip or sprint would be met with disapproval and mockery. Edwin tried to explain how it wasn't harming anyone and that since his ability was refined it was no longer dangerous, but his parents seemed adamant on ending his "bad habit".

The more pushback Edwin faced, the more he felt the need to keep on traversing the streets and pathways of his town, sideways. He started taking notes on how far he could go without the risk of stepping too far back into the past or forwards into the future, and he kept a map of all the safe places he could freely move around.

Time passed and Edwin kept enjoying his unique method of walking, although not as frequently as before. But still, it was his secret moments of joy and his way of moving through life - sideways.
