My family was harvesting on an alien planet with the hope of returning glorious riches to the other side of the universe when a sudden spark of electricity surrounded us. When I opened my eyes, I found myself in a strange metal container. I soon realized I was on Mars, but how and why I had no idea. 

I searched the area with my family, but nothing seemed familiar. After further inspection, I found a computer that could contact NASA, but for some unknown reason, they never responded. We were on our own. 

We scurried around the small area, looking for any clues that may explain the situation. We found several other such bases in the vicinity, but they were abandoned. Not another living soul in sight. 

We ventured out and explored the planet, hoping to find any evidence that may explain what had happened to us. The longer we explored, the deeper our confusion grew. We hadn't accomplished the mission we were sent on, so our goal of returning glorious riches was unfulfilled. 

My family was feeling discouraged when suddenly a moment of clarity hit us. We collectively remembered an oddly worded warning blipping across the computer which suddenly made perfect sense: "Earth is under attack."

We had been brought here in case the war was to reach Earth. Something was happening in our universe, and we were powerless to stop it. Our only hope was to survive the coming war and make a brave new start here on Mars.
