As the ancient Egyptian pharaohs, in the land of Egypt, have discovered, it's not easy to wish for something with complete certainty. So they use sigils to help others make wishes. Sometimes, of course, a sigil is the means by which a person's wish is fulfilled anyway. For example, when the hieroglyphic king Tutankhamen's birth anniversary came around in the year of the city of Amarna, he got to choose which one of his four daughters he wanted to be born. So far so good. But after he chose the sign for his fourth daughter, he got to choose what her name would be. He chose the sign for "Amarna," but his daughter was born and named a different. The choice to name her, of course, triggered the birth of Queen Nefert. Of course, the real reason for Amarna (named after the Pharaoh Amun-Ra, who made the sigil) was because the great king wanted his fourth daughter to have the qualities that would help to protect him: beauty, virility, and strength. The Egyptians did indeed believe that if your name could make the chosen sigil in your name, you would have an easier time fulfilling one of your wishes.

In this, the world over, and more especially in the magical world, sigil use has developed in an interesting way, to create things that have the properties of their corresponding sigils. Sometimes what makes magical sigils powerful is that they take full control over their properties.

For example, the sigil for an individual's name can activate the magical power of the person, just as the sun's rays can activate the magic of gold, the power of iron, or the power of fire. The sigil for water can give a person's water skills strength, such as in swimming.
