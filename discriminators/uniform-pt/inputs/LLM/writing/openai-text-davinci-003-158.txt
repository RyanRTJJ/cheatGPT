Patrick stepped carefully through the ruins of what was once a great city. Despite the long years since civilization had been reduced to these weathered blocks of stone, the architectures still presented a grandeur Patrick had not seen anywhere else.

He had heard the stories of the power that had been contained here hours ago, but now all that remained were the wind whistling through its ruins. He looked around as he walked, his mind a curious tapestry of thoughts.

"What happened here?"

As he continued to explore, he came across an old structure seemingly untouched by time. He stared in awe at the ornate doors, partially open. Taking a breath, he pushed them open and entered.

The inside of the room quickly revealed to him the truth of what this place must have once been like. In the center of the room sat a sculpture of a man, surrounded by a grand circle of objects and symbols of ancient mythology.

Patrick almost felt as though the man was looking at him, as if they both knew the secrets of the city. He reached out to touch the sculpture, but something stopped him. As if out of nowhere, whispers echoed in the room.

Patrick backed away and tried to calm himself. Then, the answer hit him like a wave. This place had been destroyed by the gods, who had no mercy for its careless inhabitants.

He quickly exited the room and walked out of the ruins, feeling a newfound respect for the city and its history. He would be sure to tell his friends of its magnificent secrets and warn them about playing with the godsâ€™ power.
