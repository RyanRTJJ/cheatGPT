 After seeing the body, he is then confronted with the crime again. His friend and co-worker decides to take the serial killer seriously and murder him after a shootout in which the murderer is shown to have no memory of the scene.  A year and over, he continues to take revenge upon the killer who had murdered his girlfriend the previous year.  
For some weird reasons, my book is not a science fiction novel.  This is a horror read, like Lovecraft's, which I imagine will hold quite a bit of interest, but I've decided to leave that a choice.  A more realistic take would be to write the novel as an experiment, where the narrator makes a real killing field, taking the victim on, and using that to get information about the victims' lives.  He is not doing this by accident, you know, in the context of the game he is playing.  
I would like to find the author's name, if the answer to the query is "Lizzie Oates", as it reads "Karen."  I'm interested in hearing any comments when possible as I found one in a recent Reddit post where someone described how much he enjoyed a book like this, and how much he could have done differently if he had chosen to write it instead.  
I'm trying to explain that there is quite a bit of writing history here, and it seems to be in some very old school science fiction that one or the other of the books in this series, although perhaps not particularly good or bad, has made changes recently.
