The meeting room was deathly silent as every gaze turned to the figure standing in the corner. Her words echoed through the room like a ghostly whisper, only it was made up of sheer defiance. No one dared to breathe as they waited to hear what the figure had to say.

Death stepped forward and calmly said, "This is your last warning. You must choose one of your loved ones to die, or else everyone in this room will suffer for it." 

The figure stood her ground and replied, "Death, I'm a little busy right now. I have things to do and I can't be making decisions like this. I just can't do it! So please leave me be."

No one knew what to say. It was such a brave and audacious act. Death stepped forward, her black cloak billowing out behind her. She said nothing, no hint of her feelings given away with her expressionless face. 

Finally, she spoke. "Very well, I will not take a life today. But remember, when you refuse the choice I present to you, the one you believe to be too hard, it will be your own death you will have to face one day."

The figure nodded in acceptance, and Death left the room in silence. Everyone was in awe of the figure's resilience and courage. No one would soon forget her words: "Death, I'm a little busy right now!"
