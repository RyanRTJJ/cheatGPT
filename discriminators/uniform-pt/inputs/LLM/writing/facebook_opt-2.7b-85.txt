  It could be anything from being raped (but I'm pretty sure all the stories will be about being raped) to a specific childhood memory.    Edit: also, do you really think a story about being raped would even win?
I don't know how to make this story or get it made.   I didn't mean it would win, just if it did. I have been trying to write more and thinking of ways to get them to a publisher. I also thought it would be fun to try my hand at writing something where both parties are okay with it being shared. Something more private but still open. I want to try writing stories about sexual assault for a while because I think it is more common than most people think.
Writing it isn't the same thing as submitting it.  But you should write and submit it.  You just can't have the expectations that winning on the internet is actually going to help in actual literary writing.  In any case, I'll give it a shot.  Let me know if I can help in any way.
I don't think winning on the internet helps anything either.   I don't think I can get this written because I have a really hard time just making it come to life. I would love any advice I can get because I know this will be a long term thing because I am writing something this intimate.   Thanks a ton :)
Just keep making it happen.  Write as much as you can.  If there is a part you don't get to or can't find the right way to express, then just say "fuck it" you'll just make something else work.  When the poem isn't working anymore, just go back to the paragraph and start over.  You don't need a lot of motivation in a piece like that.
Haha
