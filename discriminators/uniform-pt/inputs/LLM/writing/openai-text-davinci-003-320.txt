Once upon a time, in a world ravaged by some great cataclysmic event, there was a lone survivor. No one knew how she managed to survive, but despite the odds, here she was, the last living human on the planet.

The survivor's days were full of despair, struggling to find food and other basic necessities. Despite her predicament, she never gave up her hope - until one fateful day when a figure appeared before her.

Death had come for the survivor, but it was not the same, dark, skeletal creature as seen in old tales. This Death was different, dressed in a smart suit, smiling in a warm, comforting way.

"Death has come for you," Death said. "But today, I shall not take you away. I have come to escort you, to give you a second chance at life."

Tears covered the survivor's face as the gravity of this statement struck her. Death had never done this before.

Death held out a hand and the survivor took it, trusting in this odd gesture of kindness. Together, they began their journey to somewhere new, a place where the survivor could start again. For, although death had come for the survivor, it was ultimately Life that was given.
