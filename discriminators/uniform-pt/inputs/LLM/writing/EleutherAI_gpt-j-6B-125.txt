The announcement was made a couple of hours ago and the TV show is currently in the middle of breaking news.

What happened? How did you find out about the President's big secret?

He concluded his speech by stating that although the Mars bacteria were almost identical to Earth bacteria, this bacteria cannot live on this planet (Mars) because the atmosphere of Mars is much less dense than the atmosphere of Earth.
You have to find out what your main character thinks of the president's speech, especially about how long it will take to find a planet that will have the same conditions as Earth (and hopefully, life).
