It started out as a way to keep people entertained during hard times- a lighthearted competition with low stakes. Little did anyone know that the spectators would eventually be glorifying more brutal, bloodthirsty matches.

The introduction of gladiator tournaments came quietly and under the radar. On a small island off the coast of the United States, a series of arenas were built, each with intricate technology designed to make fights more instrumentally challenging and complex. Instead of being a test of strength and courage, matches became a test of skill and agility. Fighters were given armor and cybernetic enhancements to enhance their ability, as well as weapons and gadgets to make sure they had every advantage they needed. 

The new version of gladiator fights provided much needed distraction from the trials and tribulations of everyday life. Initially, the games were remained fairly normal, but it wasn't long before the crowd called for something much more extreme. Each arena slowly started to outdo the others in terms of complexity and lethality, making sure that the matches became as close to death matches as possible, without anyone actually dying of course. Death was still considered something of a taboo topic, but that didn't stop fights from becoming extremely intense.

In time, gladiator tournaments have become a popular form of entertainment, with people from all over the world tuning in to witness epic battles. They are a big business in the United States, and while they may never be able to return to the days when they were more low key and cerebral, they still help to provide an escape from the issues of the modern world.
