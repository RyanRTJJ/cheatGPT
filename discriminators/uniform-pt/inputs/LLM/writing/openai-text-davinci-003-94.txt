Mia was essentially a model citizen. No criminal records, excellent grades in school, and strong relationships with her peers — what more could one ask for?

But it was at this moment in her young life that it all came crashing down. 

One fateful morning, the police barged into Mia’s home and informed her that she was under arrest for a crime she hadn’t committed. She was devastated, confused and panicked. How could this be happening to her?

It soon became clear why she was taken in — the government was desperate to fill prisons as the population was dwindling and the prison industry was dying. For the sake of their own selfish gains, they were willing to incriminate anyone for almost any charge.

Mia asked her lawyer for help, but there was nothing he could do. The government was ruthless in their pursuit and was refusing to give her a chance to prove her innocence. Defeated and disheartened, Mia had no option but to accept her fate. 

Mia spent three long years in prison, but instead of giving up, she emerged a much stronger and wiser person. She was aware of the injustices of the system and had made a vow to help others in her same situation someday. 

And one day, she did make a difference — not only to escaping the unfortunate circumstances of others, but also by advocating for a fairer system of justice. Mia had survived the government’s attempt to incriminate her and she had won.
