Despite being a doting mother, I never received the gift that I had always dreamed of from my 18-year-old son. Every other parent around me seemed to have this special bond with their teenage children, a bond that was only strengthened when they received their small gifts or notes through time travel. Although I was filled with envy and sadness, I never gave up hope that I would eventually receive some kind of message from my child. 

As my son approached his 18th birthday, I eagerly awaited the arrival of a package or note sent through time travel that should have been addressed to me. But no package ever came. 

I was devastated, yet I never gave up hope that one day I would receive something, no matter how small it may have been. I tried my best to suppress the feeling of grief, but my heart still ached from the loss of not knowing my son on a deeper level like his peers were able to with their gifted messages from the past. 

Finally, after months of waiting and hoping for a sign, my son wrote me the most beautiful letter that expressed his love for me and all my sacrifices throughout his life. Reading it brought tears of joy to my eyes, for finally I had the message I had searched for, that spoke of our bond and understanding. I knew from then on, no matter how far he travelled in time, our relationship would never be broken.
