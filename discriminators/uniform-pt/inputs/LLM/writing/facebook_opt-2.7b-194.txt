 The author(s) and publication(s) responsible for the original prompt will receive free advertising on reddit until the story is delivered.  This is for fun and I don't expect anyone will pay.
That's pretty good actually!  Thanks.
So would I be correct in assuming that I could buy/do something like this for my business?
I would imagine at least a small portion of what makes up that kind of ad. However, with so many great writers, I'm not really sure what counts towards writing a good piece.
Hmm I'll have to figure it out. I'll take your advice and just sit down and write the damn thing. Thanks for your comments!
Thanks for the idea!  The fact you're thinking it's possible is going to attract writers!
I'm pretty good, but really like to hear feedback. Hope I didn't say it was a bad story or anything. I guess I need to learn if what I feel is good enough and what I think could possibly be more.  Anyway, thanks again for the idea. It was really creative and creative writers are really hard to come by.
I agree. You've done a good job of setting the scene (well enough to get the idea out there) and you've been consistent. Those two things seem to me to be huge advantages on their own.  Keep going!
Ya the problem is I can't always do what the best people do...  Even when I think of something crazy awesome, it doesn't happen lol.  Thanks!
That will always be a huge hurdle. I think you would surprise yourself.
Thank you. It's nice to hear that it could happen. In my dreams I've had someone else take over for me and they do a great job. So I know that I'm capable of stepping up and doing any job I ever wanted to, but I also feel like it's really hard for me to step up and be a leader.
