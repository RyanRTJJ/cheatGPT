 That's it. Or do something else, and you'll either be a true genius or a wannabe at alcohol denial.
[ CC ] In this challenge, you must tell a story based on a given sentence. [ CW ] The "sentence" must be longer than 300 characters.
Let us see who can do it most successfully...
[ CW ] It may only be a short story.  There is no need for it to include a verb.


...but if you have a great short story idea, please try to find a way to tell it.
If you can't... try a longer sentence.
[ cc ] Try to include at least six characters who are not your readers. For example, you may suggest a short anecdote or two about the time you were out late with friends. And of course, it helps to list the characters who might be interested in the story.
[ C ]...this challenge might also be fun if you're taking on a new piece of fantasy fiction. Try writing some backstory or setting information for something exciting that the characters might encounter later in the story.
[ D ]...in this challenge, it's not about the length of the story, nor the number of characters. This is about the story being told. You are the storyteller and you have three months.
This short story challenge should be a good test of your work and your skills. If you'd like to take the challenge after reading through this list and trying the word games below, I'd be happy to send you a copy of my book. You'll find all nine word games at the bottom of this page!
This challenge is open to every single one of my writers. If you don't have one to write or are not writing, you can give it a try!

I hope that my rules of thumb and rules you've already written will help you write more easily and get more out from your stories!
