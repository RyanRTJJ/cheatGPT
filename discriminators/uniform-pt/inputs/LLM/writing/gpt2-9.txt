 He then dies when he finally reaches his full potential.  A few months has passed since this ghost disappeared from the world you see in the book.  The next night we woke up, and we asked our parents if they were okay with us calling things ghost. They told us they thought we would be afraid but we couldn't bear to talk about it ever.  At that point we went back to sleep and continued watching.
