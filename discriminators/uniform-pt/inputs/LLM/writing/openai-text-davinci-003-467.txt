John was walking down a park path, hands in his pockets and a lightness to his step. It had been a while since he’d visited the park. As he reached the central square, he spotted a single swing, swaying slightly in the breeze. His steps slowed as he moved closer and a wistful smile tugged at the corner of his lips.

John couldn’t help himself - he reached out to push the empty swing. Its coarse chains scraped against his palms as he gave it a gentle shove, sending it back and forth in wide arcs. His eyes closed as he imagined his children in their place, playing and laughing in the afternoon sun.

In his mind, he could hear their little voices, chattering excitedly as they raced across the grass. He could almost feel the weight of their small hands tugging at his shirt, begging him to join in on their make-believe games.

John pushed the swing with more intent, the memories washing over him with each gentle push. He stayed like that for a few more minutes, the swing’s rhythmic sway matching the rhythm of his thoughts. Eventually, he opened his eyes and exhaled slowly, accepting the realization that his children had grown.

John stepped back and watched the empty swing for a few moments before turning to walk back down the path. His heart was a little heavy but he carried the fond memories with him, knowing there was always time to make new ones.
