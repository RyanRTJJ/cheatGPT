 If you don't see how this can work, I'm not sure where to go from here.
Thanks for the advice. Ill try that out. I also tried another suggestion I was given of writing a fictional story (because I need some free time to make up some stuff). I've been trying to do that, and it hasnt been bad. When I get around to finishing it, Ill post it here and maybe one or two others who might be interested :)  Edit- Fixed my auto correct because its been a week and Im still getting used to typing :)
If you have already started the story, don't delete it. It will help flesh it out. Then just get it through somewhere like fanfiction.net.
I think Ill stick with the original post here. I know what I was going for and I dont really want to copy someone else, but I also want to make it up so I think I have the best of both worlds in this sub  Thank you for the suggestions though. I really appreciate it :)
You don't have to make it yours! But in general I think that's the best way to go.
That's true. I dont want to steal anyone's work, especially my own. I have had ideas for it that I think can work (but I just feel horrible taking credit for an idea). Ill do my best to finish it by this weekend so Ill post here then :)
I'm sure we would love to read it.
I will try! Ill post it here soon, right before I go to bed :) Have a good night my friend :)
You as well. Don't forget to reply here when you do post it.
Will do! I only had time to do it and get it typed, but Ill post here in the morning. Thanks :)
