 That's what I like about this book. It's not too dark and some things seem to change throughout the story, I hope you liked it.  This book will be good for kids.  If you think it is not good I strongly recommend reading it for adults. Here are some excerpts of what I wrote the other day (for fun): It's all great. "The best I've read in a long time" - Michael P. Shiller. That was my recommendation all along... I know those kinds of books are hard to recommend - how about this one? What about this one, though? This book had me excited again... Maybe I will read it for another two weeks and then get off to read. The other author's got me in mind at least once at some point, he might not even be able to read it all... The plot is fine. I'm happy to see it move onto the next issue. For now, good luck and see you next year! * * * As it's titled, this book is an example of what I mean when I mean "fantasy" or what's called "fantasy writing." I am not referring to the books in the anthology that have been published, this is where I am making this list. * * - I will begin writing about this volume, and possibly one more from the next year or two. (There will be about 20-35 stories in the volume, but if you just check out a few, let me see how they stack up in terms of how they stack up in terms of fiction genres) The books in this list will often be the same book that was listed above by Shiller (the "best I've read" of these two writers). All they are is a bit of both. For I must say, I'm really pleased with these other two books, they have so many people to talk to... and lots of people to write to. I am very excited... and I can't wait to see
