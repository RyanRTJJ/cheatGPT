A frantic gasp escaped my mouth as I awoke in what appeared to be a dreary gray fog, devoid of sound and life. Unsure of where I was headed, I stumbled forward. Out of the fog stepped two figures, neither of whom I had ever seen before, but I could tell by their demeanor that I was standing before both God and Satan.

A chill ran down my spine and I suddenly realized where I was-- limbo. I had died in a car crash and it had finally caught up with me. The figures before me remained silent, and I was filled with dread as I realized that if I wanted a second chance at life, I had to impress both God and Satan.

I paused in thought, and then slowly began to tap a rhythm on the ground. As I began to pick up speed and complexity, I soon found myself lost in the beat. I had always been a gifted drummer, but this was something else entirely. Even though I wasnâ€™t playing on an instrument, my life depended on the beat that was coming out of me.

When I finished, the two figures began to clap. Satan nodded his head with approval and God had a gentle smile on his face. I had impressed them both, and with that I felt a warmth come over me. I knew that I had been given a second chance. Before I knew it, I found myself waking up again, this time in a hospital bed. I had cheated death and I was alive.
