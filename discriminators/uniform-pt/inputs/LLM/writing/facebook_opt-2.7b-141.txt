 EDIT: That's not very interesting for a prompt. You need some really deep subtext here. If it's only Google going down, there's a lot more depth to the idea than that.
I think maybe you misread the prompt. It requires a question which should be something which could be asked and answered in r/r4r, not a question you could easily search for yourself via Google. The question would be "what is your favorite thing about the world we live in?" which leads to the prompt: "what about the world we live in are you glad you don't have?" But perhaps I misunderstood the prompt.
This is what I assumed. You should include in the text that Google will go down for a good 20 minutes, which will leave you with time to think about a story. So my question is, could you think of a question that would keep you on your toes for 20 minutes?
This is where the subtext is important. How does the internet go down for 20 minutes? Is Google just off to the hospital? Or is there an announcement?
It's a question. "What is your favorite thing about the internet?" I'm just saying it's a bit dry. If you really need it to have all that context and subtext, then maybe you should make a different write-up. I understand how you're feeling, but I don't think that's realistic. What I think you need to do is look for a different prompt and try to fit it in there.
I do think this is a bit dry for the sub. I don't think anyone would feel as strongly about this if the internet went down and you wouldn't know why. I don't see a good starting point for the story here.   Is there anything you would like to see in my write-up?
If you want advice, you should probably ask it *in a prompt.*
This has nothing to do with advice. I have a writing prompt which I need help with.
