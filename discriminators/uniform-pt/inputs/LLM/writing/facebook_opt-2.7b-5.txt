 for an internship in my first summer out of uni. I have done my part well and so it has to be good right?
What was the idea?
"When I first arrived in Sydney, Australia, my father was worried that I would lose my work ethic when I arrived here as he had never seen anyone work harder than myself."  Edit: I didn't want an idea for it, but for a twist I was going to make the MC think he wrote his letter and someone actually did it. I was going to make the MC think they were writing it too.
You are not really answering the prompt. You have to say what you wanted as a result and it can only be from that one experience.
My goal was to make the MC think the internship letter he wrote was written by someone else. I wanted a twist because the other letter was supposed to be from the MC, therefore he would have to go with the twist. Instead he would have to try and find who actually wrote it. This would work because you can't tell me how I want to make my prompt work.
Don't make your prompt work to your own benefit.  Your question needs to specify the challenge, not just make your prompt fit whatever answer you're after. It's a basic storytelling skill.
I am answering and if the story doesn't have the challenge it doesn't have the potential for great storytelling, I'd say it doesn't belong here.
The 'it doesn't belong here' attitude has no place in the writing community.
If my post was about what I'd want a story to accomplish I wouldn't have asked an rf story community.. I'd have asked a writing one, where OP might have a better chance at people with stories similar to his.
The story isn't here to accomplish anything.  It's just here to show that you're capable of writing a short story and are looking for people to review it.  If you're looking for a writing community then just say
