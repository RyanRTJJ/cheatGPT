     (It needs to be funny, though.)
I like the idea so much, I'll definitely consider it. :) Thanks for your suggestion.
Oh, and make it *really* funny.
Yeah, I was thinking of writing a story about it. I'm going to get on that. Thanks again for the idea. :)
It's a scary thought. Imagine that this world were real. What would you do? How would you go about doing it? Would it be something done while on earth, or if you were in a different dimension? What things would you need to be able to do it? Would it require you to have any special training? Would it be the best option?
Yeah, it's definitely scary. Although, I don't have a lot to work from, as I'm not very familiar with how all of this is all going to work out and who all is involved. I'm going to work on it, although I may have to start from scratch. Thanks for the idea. :)
Glad I could spark it.   (I actually want you to work on it because I feel you'd be the best person to make it funny/fantastic/terrible.)
It's funny and great and very thoughtful, you're totally right. :) Thank you so much. :D You're awesome.
Well, I'm glad you think this. I'm going to go write my story now.   I would love to do the same if I were you. It feels awesome to be recognized.
You're too nice. Thank you so much. :) Just wanted to say you're awesome - and that's all I could think of to say because I'm so damn nervous.
Thank you.   I like to think that I have a way with words, and if that's one way of demonstrating that then that's great.
I think that you do, and I thank you again. :D
