What makes a good story? What qualities, if any, makes you more inclined to enjoy a story than another?

If you think about it, a lot of what makes a good story is character and character development and, of course, telling a good story. The latter is more of a problem than you would think for there are a great number of wonderful stories that will never see light for one reason or another.

You write your stories to be read, not to be hidden away away in your own room. You have a story that you want to share? Write about it now.

For the past several months I have been taking part in a Google Docs Google Document where the assignment is simply to write a story of your choice each day.

So, in doing so, each member of the Google Doc can find a new story writer to read, share, and then encourage to write a story of their own. You can find our Google Doc at the following link: #storyeachday #story

If you have written a story in the past and would like to share it, as well as share the idea of writing a story each day, here is the link to that document: #storyeachday. Share, discuss, and help others write a story on this daily basis if you would like. All ideas, comments, and questions can be answered at #storyeachday. The Google Doc, like all Google docs that have been archived in the past, will be archived in the future.
