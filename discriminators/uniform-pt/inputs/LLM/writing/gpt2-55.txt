 That dream comes true after your parents have died trying to save the life of their youngest son.  Maybe they did save a life, but if something could save them, I'd have said yes.  But I'm a strong believer in the reality of your dreams, which might even justify doing what you need to survive, and you might not regret the decision you made. Maybe it will never matter how long you've kept this dream going, and your life is destined to a day in which you will be able to make the right decisions, be prepared for the next step in your life, and feel good.
You can choose not to change your destiny, but you do get choices about the things that shape your very heart. Just so long as it is not something you are going to change, and you live in a life of selflessness, hope, hope that you will enjoy things that you love. Then you will love people, in so many ways the best way to do something that you love.  It's okay to think about how you will feel when some people think that it's okay for you, and how you will feel when other people feel that not so much. It's no longer just about winning or losing, it's about what will make you happy, whether it's a decision you make or when your friends and neighbors look on and you realize it's just the right decisions.  Not to the person out there you're thinking about.  If your friends think you're a poor person, you're right; if their friends think you're a rich person, you're right; if your other friends think you're rich, you're right; you're good, you're in the right path, just like me.  A single decision can make your life better. It can make your person happy, just like it does.
That may not be your biggest, or biggest, challenge, but it would be something that you should always consider.  Don't
