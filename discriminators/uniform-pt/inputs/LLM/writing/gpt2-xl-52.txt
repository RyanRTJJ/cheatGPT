Write a story inspired by this prompt: As night falls across their village the village elders assemble to prepare for the forthcoming feast.  To appease the spirit of the beast who has haunted their lives as many have before, the village elders offer a small fortune to any warrior who can slay the beast before sunset.  One such warrior travels from the outskirts of town.  He's a seasoned warrior and a legend in his village.  Upon reaching the outskirts of town, he goes into the cave, where he meets a monstrous beast. With a shout he slays the beast and leaves the cave once again to return to his village.   Written by a warrior who has survived many battles, whose face is burned by his own sword and whose blood flows as a blue river, but whose heart, that of a true soldier, remains true to the people of his village.
