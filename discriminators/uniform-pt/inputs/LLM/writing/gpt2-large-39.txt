-------------- I came upon this book and it had a story line I could relate to. If your own story is at the end of the world as we know it, this book would be an excellent start - it's also a good read for those who want a bit deeper into the mystery and science of time travel. ------------ * * * In which a man falls into a trap, and he's caught in a trap. * * * This book was not available at the time I tried it, nor did it show up at all during the sale and refund process this week. * * * It was available in many different formats and retailers. The links will stay here for a while. * * * **When I tried it for the first time in 2005, I found this book confusing. I'm not sure why it didn't work for me the first try, or what I'm trying to say by calling it odd to find. If only it had come along in some other place by that point. ** * *** * I bought this book when it came out, on the day I finally finished the first season of Game of Thrones. It was a few years later before the show ended, though, and I didn't know much about time travel and science fiction. It was definitely a great book because it told me what I needed to know about the show, then moved on to other stuff. And for some reason, it was more interesting to read than the TV series. * * * This book is pretty funny, I think. The book will leave you a bit sad as it ends but that's part of the funny. It could also leave you very amused if you don't know anything about time travel and science fiction. **

More to come laterâ€¦
