______________________________________________ If you were interested in the story of King Arthur and his Sword of Destiny and how that went down, you might find a good spot. If not, then you will likely find quite a few other interesting stories to read. The King Arthur and the Sword Of Destiny could be very long and the reader is advised to avoid taking this seriously in a story that is too long for you to enjoy. If you do read this story and are still interested in it, please see my other site at "The Prince and Princess of Camelot" (that includes the Prince of Thieves, of course) - that includes a story about a powerful prince named Vos, a princess of the lands with a reputation for the sword (probably the most powerful and powerful sword in the world) and a friend of King Arthur's (and he has the sword of Destiny). After reading this page, you will have a better sense of the story, of what is in it, and of what it says about the sword itself. So what does King Arthur mean by the Sword of Destiny? At the very least, this is an enjoyable and meaningful story. Some people might find this too long for them, and for others, it will just be too long to write a story that really puts you into the picture and makes you think about the sword that you are talking about when you read this page. And I hope this leads you to the next point of discussion. Is this story about a sword, like all these other stories, not really the same one about a sword, or does it involve much more than "all these stories about people"? If you have other questions for me about this story and about the story you were going for or
