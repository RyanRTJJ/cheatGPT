 I think that'd be interesting.
That's actually a pretty cool idea! Definitely going to use it :) Thanks!  EDIT: I already finished writing that story. It's called The Infection and it can be found in the link.
What was the synopsis of the story?
Here, let me try to make a better summary of it using the prompt:  *The global pandemic is spreading like wildfire, killing every human being within sight. To stop it, you travel back in time and rescue the last generation of humans to exist on Earth. Now you have to decide. As a member of The Coalition of Heroes, how will you protect the humans who still inhabit these dangerous, post-apocalypse worlds?*
Oh, interesting. I'll go look this up. Very creative!
Thanks! The only problem I see is that it takes too long for a pandemic of this magnitude to move over the world, so it might not be able to happen until the end of the year.
That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about pandemics to dispute it. I'll check it out!  Good luck on the story. It'd be interesting to read.
Thanks. I'll see if i can write the last chapter really quick if I can't find some inspiration from somewhere.
Also, I forgot to ask one more thing. Can you do this on Reddit or somewhere else? I'm going to give this a listen.
Reddit would be fine, thanks!
Awesome, I'll add this to my "list of ideas" for future ideas.  Thanks for the help!
No probs! Thank you for listening :)
No problem! You made my day, really. Thank you!
