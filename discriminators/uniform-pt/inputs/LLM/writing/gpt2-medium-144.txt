 A soldier can't be superhuman just yet, but if you need him to act swiftly and decisively, he needs to be seen as superhuman.  How should he represent that?
Don't use a fictionalized or otherwise fictionalized person.  Use that person's face - not their background - to describe his abilities, skills, or skillset.  Your story should depict a particular superhuman soldier, not the real one (the character we identify in the comic book and love to read).
Consider using different techniques to write your story.  Different techniques can work (e.g., a superhero in a town full of superheroes can only be known to be superhuman if you use that technique to describe how he transforms): A lot of people are afraid of taking seriously the possibility of being superhuman.  Make it easy for people to take it seriously by leaving it at that: Do you want your hero to be human and do human things?  How do you write about people who are not human yet?  How do you write about other superhumans?  If possible, have the hero or heroine who is "real" (not a superhero) in that story be very realistic, even though she's not as defined as the superheroes. If you want to make it easy to introduce the superhero's parents, you might consider creating a monster of sorts out of their kids: How do you define parents as they grow up?  A mom and her daughter who can't keep up when her kid needs her in school? Can they raise each other?  How will they raise him/her?  You can use the monster's description to create more of a parental bond between the hero and the monster's parents.  If you write out details of the monster's childhood, like his father and mother would when they grow up are often missing from the book. You don't have to have some kind of super-villain idea here.  You probably could have Superman doing a good cause or a good thing
