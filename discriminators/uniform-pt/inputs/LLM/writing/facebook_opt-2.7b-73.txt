  Which one do you choose?
A) Infinite Knowledge. B) Eternal Happiness.  C) Never Open  Pick 3
I choose C because God already did it. I'll be stuck as eternal bliss and knowledge.
You can't pick that because there are no doors yet for God to open.
Yeah so if he's gonna keep playing this game of 3-D chess, he's gonna keep going until he wins.
In your case C) Because God already did it, A wins.
I would go with D), because it's the one that's been opened, and because we've seen the future that's not here yet.
How would we know it's not here yet if it hasn't been opened?
Well, we've only seen a glimpse of it so far. We can't know for sure what's behind it.
But in both instances of C) God hasn't fully done that and in each instance he's done part of it, so what we see now is a preview of the future.  So we can assume that A would also be true for both B) and D) (because we've seen a glimpse).
Right, because as I said, God's playing a game of chess, not giving away a check. When you ask God for a third door, he'll say "wait..." and then open a door behind yours.  You have been cheated, now you are to assume all of your doors were cheated.
No it's not, because God knew you would find the loophole of A, so obviously as such he made an exception so that you could follow his ways. What I was asking was how could we even know what is going to be behind door 3.
