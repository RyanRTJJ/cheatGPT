_____________________________________ In the second month of August of 2014, the new year officially dawned. It was quite the warm and pleasant day indeed. There was this loud and clear, warm feeling and voice that spoke to me of joy in every sense. "So glad we'll finally get this year off. We'll work harder next year. Do we have another ten years of work left?" I smiled as I said the words to that very same voice of joy. The only good thing about that bright sunny day is that it's not summer anymore. It's fall. Well, maybe September. Fall is almost here and it's not even September. It's November again, and it doesn't even fall yet! I hope the days do not soon become longer and the weeks longer and the months longer but the truth is, I have been able to keep busy as far as we know without worrying about being able to have that extra few months of rest and relaxation. A couple months ago, I was feeling very stressed but I was not sure if I should be or not! And then I got this text message from myself! I said that I was feeling more confident because of an experiment done by my family of mine when they visited me in my home. They asked me all sorts of strange questions in order to help us discover what's really going on in our hearts. But, it is not just about finding an answer. There are many different ways which we can try to find our answer to questions and the answers are always found in our hearts. The message that I got from myself was this: "I need to be stronger!" I had just received this advice from myself but this was the first time that it had hit me the hard way! What a wonderful experience it was to finally learn what my greatest fears were. With a very hard heart, I began to look forward to learning to be strong in the short term only. At first my little sisters started calling me a bit of crazy and an idiot when I tried to keep myself from taking these exercises and
