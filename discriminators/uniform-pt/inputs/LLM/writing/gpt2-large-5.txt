Saving some money and making a little room for some delicious Vegan meals
Today, we are going to make Vegan Chicken and Broccoli Stir Fry.
It's got a lot of ingredients - lots of tofu to start.
And a huge portion of protein, too
You don't need to buy a big bunch of tofu – you can easily cook it up at your slow cooker. The recipe is adapted from this recipe. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp water 2 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp honey 3 cloves of garlic, minced 6 tbsp vegan butter 1/2 cup of tempeh, chopped 2 cups or so cooked broccoli, diced, drained and cooked in 1 cup of water 4 tbsp nutritional yeast 2 tbsp tomato paste 2 tbsp lime juice 
Directions:
Heat up a large pan and add the water.
Simmer for about 7 minutes.
Add the soy sauce, honey, garlic, tempeh, nutritional yeast and tomato paste.
Cover and bring to a boil. 
After 14 minutes add some vegetable stock. 
Simmer for another 10 minutes more, covered.
In a blender or food processor combine the tempeh, broccoli and the vegetable stock. 
Stir every 5 minutes. You can also do this using a spice grinder and grinding the tempeh once or twice.
I like to use a blender to smooth it out.
Stir in lime juice. 
The chicken mixture will thicken up pretty fast!
To assemble, remove the chicken from the pot and add to a plate.
