Jenny couldn’t believe her eyes. She had just opened her email inbox only to find her own face staring back. How had these emerged out of nowhere?

Confused, Jenny clicked the link and was taken to an anonymous fan page dedicated in her honor. There were hundreds of comments from strangers from all sorts of places around the world, complimenting her actions, her skill, and her general being.

At first, Jenny laughed it off. It was the furthest thing from her mind that she had achieved any sort of Internet fame. After all, she was just a humble student entering her final year of high school.

Yet, as the weeks passed, she inquired further and discovered that over the past several months, her videos had gone viral. A series of public speaking videos she had done as part of a school competition had captured the hearts of people near and far.

Jenny was taken aback. She hadn’t realised the far-reaching impact of her work and was thus left in awe. It was an incredible feeling to know that strangers from different parts of the world had connected to her in some way, and this was all because of the work she had put into her public speaking videos.

And that’s how she discovered she was famous on the Internet.
