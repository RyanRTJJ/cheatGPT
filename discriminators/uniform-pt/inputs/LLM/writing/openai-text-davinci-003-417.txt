It was dramatic - death was standing right in front of me, visible but intangible. He offered me an opportunity to return to life, but I was uncertain about how to do so.

He smiled at me knowingly and pointed to three paths in front of us. “Choose your path wisely,” he advised. “You can choose the path of blood. It will require courage and commitment. You will have to face many challenges and acknowledge the pain that accompanies them. But in exchange, you will gain the courage that will allow you to go through life with grace and strength.

“The second choice is sweat. You will have to toil, day and night. Insurmountable obstacles will be in your way. But your hard work and dedication will eventually be rewarded with success.

“Finally, there is the path of tears. This path will ask for you to humbly surrender to life’s injustices and accept them gracefully. It will require you to face life’s miseries head on, but also appreciate its joys. 

I contemplated this for a moment, weighing the price of each path, before finally replying that I wanted to take the path of blood.

Death looked somewhat disappointed but nodded his agreement. “Very well. Your courage and strength are admirable,” he said. “Remember, if you stay true to your convictions, you will be rewarded with a second chance at life.” 

With that, he vanished. I took a deep breath, steeled my resolve, and set off on my journey of blood.
