There was an old black leather wallet, shaped like an envelope and about five inches by five inches in size, resting peacefully atop my nightstand immediately to my right. On the front, leather straps of various shades of brown overlapped each other in a scattered fashion. It had two pockets, only secured by two pale wooden buttons, each featuring intricate groove etchings. Thick brown stitching winding along its seams gave the wallet an aged rustic charm.

Inside were two slots. The first housed two yellow-tinted photographs, one of a middle-aged man standing beside a small cast-iron fence and the other of a young girl sitting on a tire swing. The other slot held a few crinkled reminders of past bills, a mixture of receipts, business cards, and a thin piece of paper with a few brief lines scrawled by hand.

Deeper beneath the wallet's cover was a pocket in which two things resided. The first a light brown leather driver's license bearing a name and an address of my hometown, and the second a note that had been hand-written by the same middle-aged man whose photo was tucked away earlier. The note, written in sloppy handwriting, said "Life is too short not to smile," and was signed underneath with a simple "Dad".

With each passing glance my eyes linger on this wallet - its worn leather edges, its engraved wood buttons, the creases and tears that it has collected over time. I can almost hear the faint whisper of my father's words, urging me to take the time to appreciate the little things and live life to the fullest.
