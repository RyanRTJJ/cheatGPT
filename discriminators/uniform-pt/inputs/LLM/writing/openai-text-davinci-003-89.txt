Alice and Bob had the same dream: Living forever. Both had become preoccupied with the concept of everlasting life since they first heard of it, and they often discussed it between them.

One day, they decided to take the plunge and try a new service that promised eternal youth and youthfulness - Tropeday 2.5.

Alice and Bob arrived at the small office where they were met by a woman in a crisp black suit. She led them to a room that seemed to have come straight from a sci-fi movie, filled with mysterious gadgets and glowing monitors. The woman explained that this was a procedure where a person's DNA could be altered to lengthen their lifespan.

Alice and Bob were full of questions, but the woman was able to answer all of their queries. They were given a choice: They could take the treatment, but with no guarantee that it would ever end. That fear of the unknown was more than enough to deter them.

Alice and Bob opted to pass on the procedure and now continue to search for other means of achieving their dream of living forever. They often spend hours discussing the issue and debating the pros and cons of different methods. But in the end, they still can't decide whether or not this is the right way for them.

The search for a way to live forever continues for Alice and Bob. As for now, they just take each day as it comes and hope that, one day, their dream will become a reality.
