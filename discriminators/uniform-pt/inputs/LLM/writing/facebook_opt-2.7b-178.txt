Awww that is pretty interesting. Couldn't think of anything though :/
Think about this in terms of the world you live in? Have you tried looking online for some information?  That's how I started writing my first story, that I posted on here. I wanted to know more about superheroes so I started looking into them.
Yeah it's in-universe. I live in a very dystopian and authoritarian state. We are in a war against an underground resistance. If my story was a movie it would be about "The First" or something like that. There isnt a lot of good superhero stuff going on
Theres a lot of good superhero stuff going on, just find it
Theres a lot of good superhero stuff going on, but the stuff thats actually good has a low chance of being on the level of DC and Marvel.  Which is why a lot of writers write about what DC and Marvel do, because they are a lot more accessible and approachable.
And a lot of people are starting to take notice. Which is why there are a lot more good superhero comics now than there were ten years ago. They're just not as popular in movie theaters and TV shows as the blockbuster superhero movies are. That's why there's more to read.
This is exactly what I'm seeing. I'm actually reading a lot more comic books now because the shows and movies I find interesting at all is the Marvel/ DC kind. Although lately I've just been reading books related to superhero/ supervillain lore just to get a sense from some of the newer books that are out there.
There's so many books out there now that it's hard to find time to read them, and a lot of them aren't that great. But I definitely have to recommend Batman: Year One and Batman: The Killing Joke.
Thanks for the recommendations. I'll have to do some more research into the Batman/Supervillain stuff I guess. I've read most of Greg Rucka's stuff so far
