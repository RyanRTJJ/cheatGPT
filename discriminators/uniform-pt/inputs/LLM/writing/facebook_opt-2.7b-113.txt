   This is what I do every time I want to write a story about something new. For what it's worth, this has worked for me for years.
Thanks for this, itâ€™s really helpful! Iâ€™ll keep it in mind :)
Glad it worked. Good luck. Let me know how it goes.
Okay I wrote about 3 or 4 more things as I was out walking, and as I read a poem by Virginia Woolf I had a revelation which I thought would be a good basis for the story :\) If my memory is accurate (and I donâ€™t have perfect short-term retention, just long term), the revelation came to me just after I wrote the second line of the poem. Any thoughts on how I might approach that?
Hmmmm. I have to admit I don't even think I could have done that. This is the sort of thing that would be a breakthrough for me and I would have to stop what I was doing and keep writing. Even then, I think the idea is worth having.  I know what that's like, because this story is part of a series that I thought up of what happened to me after a car accident I was in where I was paralyzed for a long time. I think that was about the time that I had that insight myself. The poem is pretty nice too.
Well thanks for the encouragement. I really am going to get out there and write. Iâ€™ve been wanting to for more than a year now, because I am getting more serious as I age. Thanks again! ðŸ’™
Awesome! Glad to hear that. Good luck!! I'm rooting for you!
I've got nothing but success and good vibes coming your way ðŸ’™
