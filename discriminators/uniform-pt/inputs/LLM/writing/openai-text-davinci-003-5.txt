for my job application

It was the most important day of Mark's life. He had just finished writing a motivational letter for his dream job and was eager to submit it.

He sat down to read over the letter one last time before submitting it and was not impressed with what he saw. He had spent hours drafting, re-drafting and refining the letter, but was now starting to question his efforts.

The letter was too long and meandering; the best parts were buried beneath weak lines, the tone was too casual, and there were no signs of emotion or enthusiasm in it. He felt like he was mostly bragging about his achievements and listing his qualifications. There was no passion or energy in the words.

Mark decided to give himself a little more time to work on the letter and to get some objective feedback. He posted the letter online and asked his friends to provide a critique.

The feedback was eye-opening. His friends pointed out his errors and suggested ways to make the letter stronger. So, Mark opened the letter once more and rewrote it, adding brief anecdotes about his experience, showing emotion, making it more concise and putting more effort into the writing process. 

When the updated version was complete, Mark felt a wave of relief. He was confident now that the letter he submitted would stand out among the rest and make him a more appealing candidate. With a sense of great pride, he clicked ‘Submit’ and hoped for the best.
