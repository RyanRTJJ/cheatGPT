When I was a kid I was an angry, frustrated mess. I blamed the world for my misfortune, raging when things didn't go my way. It felt like my problems would never be solved, no matter how hard I tried.

Then, one day, when I was being particularly angry, it started raining - hard. That's when I felt it, a warmth radiating from within me, and an energy I hadn't felt before. I raised my hands, and to my surprise, the rain seemed to follow my command, swirling around me in an oddly pleasing pattern.

My first thought was that I must be crazy - that I was imagining things. But then, a bolt of lightning shot out of my fingertips and towards a nearby tree. Whatever this was, it was real.

I discovered that as long as it was raining, I had the power to control nature. With just a thought, I could make the trees dance and the sky tinted in shades of purple, blue, and orange. I soon knew the rain was my key to freedom, and I savored every second I could make use of my newfound strength.

For whatever reason, my powers only worked in the rain. I never found out why, but I was glad it was the way it was. I was thankful to have something that would let me escape my troubles, even if it was only while the rain was coming down.
