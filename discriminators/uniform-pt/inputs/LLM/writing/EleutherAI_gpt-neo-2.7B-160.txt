 
Chapter 1

The day I learned to breathe was the day I stopped looking over my shoulder... or so I thought. But it wasn't until I was trapped in a car with my brother, that I realized the truth.

It all started in high school. I was fifteen and the year I would have graduated from high school. I had a few friends, but I had no idea what my future held in store. If I was going to be in a gang, I decided what I wanted more than anything was to be in a gang. I wanted to be one, like my brother, one that couldn't make excuses and tell anyone I needed to be saved. Instead, we'd say, "Hey, give it to me." And if we were playing tag, I knew I would give it to him for some reason or another. It wasn't like he had it easy. I had it harder then he did. Every day, my father made us clean the house or go to school and I would wonder why my father let me have the life that he gave me.

It was an accident I was in the car, when I didn't have my driver's license. I had an accident, my uncle happened to be in the same accident. It was like we were on purpose, he gave me a head injury.

"You're going down this road and I'm going to follow you," he said as he pulled out. He was driving through the town when he went right, not left. He was driving slower than I would have anyway to take me back to my father.

My uncle kept going and I kept going with him. I kept following him until I was fifteen, I didn't know why I kept following him. I kept doing this until he told me the truth.

"You have a lot to do here. No more than the right amount of time. You don't have to spend your life here, you can live with me." He explained he wasn't planning not to leave, he was planning to go to Europe
