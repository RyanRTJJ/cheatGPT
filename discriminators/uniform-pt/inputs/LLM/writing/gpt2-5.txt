 (don't send me a short article that accuses me of being a "f*cking idiot" because you don't "tell" anybody that you're not an optimist).   Give your point of view on the situation.
I've written it above for each reader and the idea here is to just try and get the letter written back in to one sentence. So if you have some experience of "F#" or some other type of letter, use that to get the attention and maybe, like a newbie, some ideas for making a little noise that might be useful or useful for the next person.
You can post comments, emails, and anything you want to contribute as well. I'll also include a link. Be sure to make sure to follow my blog (blog.lst.org).
If you're interested in getting further involved, there's tons to see and to read in this course!
And if you're interested in writing something about the "f*** me" meme, click here  instead   to see all the ideas I've written.
Here's how the book came to be called "Crowdfunding.F#." The author got a commission that included her being at the table and that there may be money that might come in to cover the costs of writing about how to do what's working as well as the kind of thing we're asking each other for.
Donations raised from the first person give this book a 3-5% chance. Donations to any of the books sold on the auction site from the first person to the last person will be used to cover the book production costs. We'll be using a percentage of the donations raised in order to cover costs of shipping the game. You can find out more at this blog post
If you know your best story about your character and the story you want to tell, please leave a comment. A lot of those are ideas or feedback rather than submissions. Anything is possible and it's just a matter of seeing, as one does now, how awesome they look.
