John was on his way home from work one cold winter day, and as usual he was rushing to catch his train. He always caught the same train, but this time he realized he had missed it by a few seconds. With a sigh of disappointment, he went to sit on one of the benches in the waiting area and decided to wait for the next one.

As he was sitting there, he noticed something strange happening at the tracks. It began with a puff of smoke, followed by a faint noise that sounded like a whistle. Suddenly, a shimmering light appeared on the tracks. He sat there in awe, wondering what it could be.

The light was moving swiftly, as if in a hurry. Before he knew it, the light had gone and he began to worry that he might actually have blinked because he had missed it. He quickly looked around to see if anyone else had seen it, but it seemed as if he was the only one who had.

Fascinated and curious, he decided to return the next day to see if he could catch a glimpse of the strange phenomenon. He arrived at the same time and waited, but this time he kept his eyes wide open. A few minutes later, the same light and sound appeared and shot past him, leaving him speechless.

John continued returning to the train station every day, hoping to learn more about the mysterious light. He eventually learned that it belonged to a group of people traveling through time and space. Those who traveled in it had an important task, which was to be a part of a mission to ensure the protection of the future.

John was amazed by this, and continued to observe the travelers as they went past. He thought of ways he could join them
