 That means it'll not go over here.  It could go back.  It could go to this random place named "No. 5" or something like that.  Go where there isn't a prompt for a prompt.  This is not a list.
"It's not that bad here." You know what, it's ok for things to be so far away, that you can't even begin to describe them in words.  That's what this story is not about.  This is not about a bunch of random places that I will get to in a minute.  It's about an experience I had, the first time I met a girl I actually loved.  And I guess what the character says is "Well..."
"There is no such thing as too much sex."  It's so simple, it's almost obvious when you see it.  If you don't like sex, you can ignore the rest of its descriptions. Don't feel bad if this sounds vague or difficult.  It's pretty much the only part of this story that requires explaining in order to understand. If it doesn't fit within your expectations or if that doesn't make sense to you, then it's not important and won't carry over.  If you have it figured out so far or can understand about 40% of the story and only 40% of the text (which would make you one of those people who can tell by glance in a text "Wow... you are sooooo smart!"), then you know it's a good story.
That's basically all I really needed in my first week of taking this job.  Any questions?  Please ask.  Any things I can improve?  You could do that in two ways.  Option 1, if you love stories more than I do, here are some suggestions, if you want more insight into how different things might work in a story:
1.  Tell me, what is the main plot or character thing?  Where are the other two characters?  Who the fuck does that?  Where the hell
