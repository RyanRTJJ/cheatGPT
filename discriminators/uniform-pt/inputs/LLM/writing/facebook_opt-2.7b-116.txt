 [ Post here.]  Bonus points if you go wild. Go write some crazy shit. Make it as disturbing as possible.
I can not think of anything that goes even a little bit wild enough. But I thought this was a good question to have here.   I will do what I can.  PS I am going to hell for this post, because I know that is where you belong.
What I meant to say was "Have fun writing it."
Just a bit.   And you can keep me too, for that matter.
Deal.  If at this point you feel like it's not the wildness that's the issue, but the quality then feel free to post what you wrote.   I just wanted to say I'm sorry. You have no idea.
> You have no idea  *sniffles*   I am used to that kind of reaction, I am not about to let that stop me. I am just a poor boy with a broken heart, and I can not see an end to it.
*nods* Yeah, that's what I figured.  If you're a boy, just be aware of what you're doing to your dick.  And it's not just the dick, but the rest of you as well.      Keep your spirits up, buddy. I'm not here to judge you. In fact, I wouldn't judge you if you did end up joining. I don't actually believe in Satan.
I am in a very unhealthy relationship, that I have been in for way too long, so I should know what I am doing anyway.  *sniffles*   But yeah, I am planning to. I am hoping the recruiter does me right by me.
Yeah, I hear that.   Well, as long as you're looking then I'm sure you'll be fine.
Thanks for believing in me, dude [](/scootacheer) [](/happy)
