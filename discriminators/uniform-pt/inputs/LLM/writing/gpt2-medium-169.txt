 We're pretty sure this planet is a bit rocky and could be a bit inhospitable to humans. If you have ideas for a story follow this prompt below:   Earth is discovered by an alien civilization, but we're too short and have no place to go. We have some good tech to try and get this thing up and running but there's nowhere near enough resources to actually do it.  We make some contacts with the other races and plan on getting our own ship up into space and then coming back.
The answer, by the way, will be chosen at random, so do what you want and do it as soon as you get it.  But be sure to tell us what planet you were considering, and how many people you're planning to send, if you're sending any at all, and any other information that might shed light on anything you may be planning.  Also note that we'll only post the final result of these prompts based on submissions with at least four complete stories so if you've got more than three stories we're curious to hear from. Submit your most recent story below, along with a short bio. We do appreciate your feedback. We'll post them here after we've gotten a handle on the submissions.
If you have any questions, please send an email here.
