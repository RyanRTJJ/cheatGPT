 Put the prompt in /u/Barry8's thread. This is an amazing story, please write it!
Or make it into a movie... I can dig that. And I love movies that involve aliens.
So would I, if it weren't for the plot. As in the lack of a plot.
Do you mean like a lack of an actual plot?
Yes. I haven't seen the movie in years, but, I remember it clearly. That's the bit that bugs me the most, the part with the aliens taking over earth. To me, it leaves the plot open for interpretation.   "Yeah, they're probably here to abduct us."   "Well, maybe they just want to help us out?"   "Maybe they're all in on the plan because they were sent here too."
Agreed, that's the part I hated the most as well. I didn't care for the plot really much in that movie, I just thought it was ridiculous how "cool" it was and how people praised it.
People on reddit?  I love reddit, but the general consensus on reddit that a movie's "cool because it's a sci-fi movie" is fucking ridiculous.
Not just reddit I can recall, mostly in the comments section on sites and forums really. It's just very popular to like sci-fi/spaceships/alien abduction movies (I am also guilty of that by the way). Most people I talk to dislike that, but there is def a market for that kind of thing.
Yeah, I'm guilty of that too. It's just, I wouldn't dream of saying that movie should be made and given to me, but everyone always makes a point to tell me how much they enjoyed it.  The general feeling on reddit just doesn't fit the movie, I guess?
