The next question is, what are your last thoughts of Jesus? What about the angel who says to you, "You have to choose—you can help me by giving your body to me or to your loved ones" (John 12:24).

  | • When you give your body to them, you see yourself—but transformed. The angelic beings become a beautiful vision to all who see you.  
  | • Then you realize you're made into an instrument through which the truth is given.

  | • The angel says, "You will be the messenger to the world of justice. You've accepted He has a plan, even if you don't know which one."
