It had been nearly six weeks since I had been captured.

My captors wanted me to reveal a secret, but I knew that if I did, it would mean certain death for me and others. So, I kept quiet, no matter how much they tortured and beat me.

Finally, they had had enough. They were planning to execute me the next day. I was desperate, so I bit off my own tongue, hoping it would buy me time to escape.

Much to my surprise, they chose to save my life. Instead of executing me, they left me with a pad of paper and a pencil every night. I had to write out my confession with the expectation that I could earn my freedom if I provided the secret they wanted.

For weeks, I wrote the same thing each night, my secret that I could not reveal. I kept hoping that if I made them believe I had nothing more to say, they would eventually leave me alone and grant me my freedom.

Eventually, my luck paid off, and they set me free without revealing my secret. But, I will never forget that fateful day, or my sacrifice that saved my life.
