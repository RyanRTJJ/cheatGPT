 You now know the secrets of the sword in the stone and its location, but are you strong enough to challenge the stone?
Have two characters get stuck in a rope bridge and need to escape.  Have to explain to them that they can still swim, or they think that is exactly what they have been searching for.  What happens next is up to you.  This is a very challenging idea to get right, though.  If it is too difficult and the idea is completely original or not clear, I can get pretty pissed off at the writers for not giving me anything close to what I asked for.  I can see why the writer did not.  You know why?  Because they are trying to be clever.  So when writing a challenge I usually give the story a bit of an extra nudge to put them across. If the writers give you something similar, take it to heart, and get it right. The main thing I like in challenge questions is to give them a few hints to keep you guessing as to what is going on.  What I have done is to ask the question a couple of times on the first page, and then after a few times it is usually clear as to what the problem is. At its simplest, the goal of the challenge is to use a premise or theme in a story to kick off that challenge.  To show that there is an issue they could be dealing with in the story, that might even happen the next day.  You may need a few variations, and I would like an idea if you really wanted to do it right. If you are going to use a challenge, I would advice against using an image or sound in the question to show you are doing
