 And it was just...not right.  The door slammed shut and the wall was empty save for the faintest of sounds.  The shadows were thick, thick.  A thick, heavy, silent shadow.  Even in the pitch black, you could feel it moving and breathing as you tried to walk forward, against your better judgment.  Once you were over close enough to make out a single, pale-yellow eye staring down at you.  And as your eyes adjusted to the darkness, you could see that it was a woman.  With a long, spindly body, bent at the waist and slightly bent forward.  She wore no makeup; only the slightest dab of lipstick on her pale face.  Her long, white hair was tousled, just a thin smear at the nape of her neck and a few strands down her arms.  And a single, unbroken eye kept watching you through those thick, empty lashes. There was something odd about the woman.  You began to wonder just what did a being like her even look like.  And what did she mean when she repeated the phrase "never".  What did she mean by "never"?  She hadn't said anything when you entered the room.  The faintest glint in her eyes was all you heard.  And then, the door opened...and the shadows returned. There was absolutely nothing you could do to stop them.  You could not have even opened the door at all.  A dark thing came through the room just then, an odd, black, glowing thing that moved through the shadows, the one thing you could hear in the silence.  With a sickening clank, it touched the door and locked in place.  In that instant, your life changed. You'd seen strange things at that age.  Something was watching you every moment of every day.  And you had nothing to protect yourself from it.  There was no help for you.  You could not run.  And there was nothing you could do
