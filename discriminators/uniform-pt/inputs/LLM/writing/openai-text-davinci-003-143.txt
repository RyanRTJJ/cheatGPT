He started out with a plan. It was simple: abduct a wealthy family's child and hold her for ransom. He had studied the family and timing was everything, he reasoned. He had waited until the family was out of town — the perfect opportunity to take their daughter away and hold her hostage until they paid the ransom.

But, when he took her, he was immediately struck by her agonized pleas and trembling body. As he drove away, he couldn't help but feel pity for this little girl — not only because she was taken away from her family, but because of the fear in her trembling voice.

He took her to a small hideout on the outskirts of town and had her stay there for a few days before he eventually started to talk with her. He had wanted to remain silent initially, but curiosity eventually changed his approach. To his surprise, her stories revealed a much more troubling home life than being kidnapped and confined.

She told him about abuse from her parents and how she had been moved from one foster home to the next, each situation worse than the last. He realized he might have intercepted her on her way to another dangerous and possibly worse situation, and he began to feel more and more conflicted.

With his pity and guilt growing, he eventually released her back to her family. She had no questions as he dropped her off, and he silently hoped she would find a happier and more secure future.

He never talked to anyone about what he had done but, to him, his actions were not criminal. He had, in his own way, rescued a young girl from an abusive home and given her a chance to live a better life.
