Eighteen, finallly. Today was the day I had been waiting for my entirety of my life - on my eighteenth birthday I would finally receive the superpower that would define my future. I had dreamed of being able to fly, to read minds, or shoot fire from my hands ever since I was a little girl. So, with a trembling hand I reached out for the golden ball that symbolized the power of the gods.

But instead of empowering me, it cursed me.

The ball exploded, leaving me wit ha power that no one in my world had ever been given. The power was immortality. I would never age and never die. In that split second my entire life changed - now the future stretched out endlessly before me. I could no longer grow, no longer change and evolve like the rest of my peers. I was stuck in this moment in time, forever.

I wanted to cry and scream, so I threw my hands up to the heavens, demanding an explanation. But, as usual, my prayers went unanswered. I screamed out my anger and despair until my throat was sore, but still nothing.

Finally, I accepted my situation, however reluctantly. Perhaps with time I could find a way to make the best of this power, even if it was not the one I had hoped for. I vowed to devote my extended life to helping others, in whatever way I could, whatever would make this power a blessing instead of a curse.
