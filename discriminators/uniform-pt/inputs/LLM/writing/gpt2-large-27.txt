The people who were playing the prank on the car were very annoying. We saw a lot of them on our way in. It was very disorganized around their route (there will be photos of the area of the prank).


The thing I'm thinking about, is if this was an attempt to stop an imminent terrorist attack, there's a long list of very possible reasons why it wouldn't work. You could throw a flash grenade in there, or use a bomb in there, or hit it into an airliner. Most of those you can pretty much guess the answer on, and the same goes for some of the others. If I was writing this, I couldn't think of most of the reasons why this wouldn't work.


That said, these are all very annoying and annoying people. Maybe if Google Street View cars drove through a house with a sign stating a dead dog is outside, that might have been more believable.

I am not laughing at you! Your silly prank is no laughing matter!
