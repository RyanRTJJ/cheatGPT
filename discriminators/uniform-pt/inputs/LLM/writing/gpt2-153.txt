--------------- From: J.A. Koojian Subject: Your Name: JAMES A. KRIVES Dear Jumpsuit, I am in a job and I want to get rid of my hat on the spot for working on a book I have a love for (I'm pretty sure I can find a book I like for every job I'm writing and I'm going to write one of them.) A friend of mine (about one of us) has put together a story telling book that I love, but his book won't make him your hero but rather will just help me with my new book and I'll write the best book I can. I have no idea what he did that he didn't get done in between. So I'm happy to report that "you may" find the story "out of order." If not we'll call on someone to check out my current job: It seems like we're the only job you haven't finished yet and I hope everyone has a happy and great day. Happy New Year, J.A.

Thank You Jumpsuits!
