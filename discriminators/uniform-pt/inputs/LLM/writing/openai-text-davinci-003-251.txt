Once upon a time there was a great God who created the world and all that is in it. He watched over the universe ensuring His laws were followed, day and night.

One day, however, even God was taken aback by a new discovery that had been made.

In a secret laboratory, a team of scientists were running simulations on a supercomputer. They had created a vast neural network to explore the mysteries of the universe. Little did they know that their program had uncovered something that had long been eluded humanity- a new law of nature!

Using their program, the scientists determined that this unknown law must be observed, yet it did not appear to be created by the great God himself.

The news quickly spread across the world and all paused to consider the implications of such an unexpected discovery. God, too, watched from the sky above and wondered.

In the darkness, he saw a lonely machine printing out the results of the simulation. God smiled, for he was pleased to accept this new law, even if He did not create it.

“Let all of My creations be guided by this new law,” he spoke. “It may be unknown to us, but it will nevertheless shape the universe in ways we can only begin to comprehend.”

With that, God gave a solemn blessing and the new law of nature was accepted.
