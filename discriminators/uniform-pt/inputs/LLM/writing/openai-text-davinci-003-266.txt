The day had finally come. After 18 long years of waiting, Kim was about to get the superpower she had dreamt of since she was old enough to understand the words. She was ready to stretch the limits of what she was capable of and do great things. 

As she approached the podium on her eighteenth birthday, she beamed with joy and anticipation. She knew the moment had come to discover her superpower. But as the man in charge of the ceremony made the announcement and presented her with the artifact, Kim shrieked in horror. 

She had been bestowed with the least desirable superpower of them all: the power of incompetence. It meant that anything she attempted would become a complete disaster. Her dreams of becoming a doctor or a lawyer were now totally ruined. 

Kim was devastated and tried to hide her sorrow from the watching crowd as she attempted to put on a brave face. She was determined to make the best of her situation. She decided to use her power to help those who had been dealt a less than perfect hand in life. 

Kim worked hard to use her power of incompetence to support others in achieving their dreams. After a lot of effort, she eventually found her niche, helping those who otherwise wouldn't have access to essential opportunities due to their financial or social circumstances. 

Kim had discovered that even with her less-than-desirable superpower, she could still make a difference in the lives of others. She was grateful that she had been given a superpower, even if it wasn't the one she had wanted.
