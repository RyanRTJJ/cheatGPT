________________. While you’re stuck and not particularly liking this person, what exactly would you like them to do? This isn’t a task for everyone, and it should be fun, but it can be the push you need to move things forward.

I usually start a story by telling the character I’m writing a story with in the first few pages. “Lily Jane is at home, eating dinner. She gets a call on her cell phone. It’s David.”

(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)

I’ll then go into the character’s day and ask them an interesting question about it:

(1) What did you do yesterday?

For example, you might ask, “What did you do yesterday evening? David went to visit his cousin in the city. When he got back to the city, he called Lily Jane because he had something important to tell her.”

(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)

After this, the protagonist of the story will find another day to write the story based on what they learned or the question they asked.

Some examples of interesting questions to ask as you write:

1) What are you going to tell this friend/neighbor/coworker with whom you’re stuck?

“I’m so sorry, but David is such a slob. He doesn’t clean up after himself or anything, so this whole thing is really starting to grate on our relationship. You’ll have to call your friend and cancel our date.”

2) What did you watch on TV today?

“I was doing my weekly book club chat on the show, The Office.”

3) Do you think that person’s problems are your problems?

I’ll do this after I know the question, and then use the story to answer both questions (and do so better).
