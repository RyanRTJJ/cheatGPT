 I read over the stories I have remembered and realized I never really cared what anyone had to say.  They were mine.  If I didn't remember, I never really believed that I did.  I used to tell myself I was on some kind of quest and have to get the memory back somehow but I was never content.  I believed my memories didn't exist, and that I was doing a job for them.  I kept a collection of stories in my head because, in reality, I didn't care.  I told myself I wasn't doing this for memories.  I felt like an agent telling a man I need to stop smoking.  I was a ghost telling myself to go into my room and forget my pain, and it's ok because, in a way, I was the one who gave the guy the pain in the first place.  That's me I am making up the pain.  The best example of this was watching myself cry at the news.  I always believed in reality, so the real, raw emotion came through in my sobbing. The other question of this story is if I'm an author myself.  Are the thoughts I have to tell myself to feel sad not just the "me" feeling? In short, yes.  The reality, though, is that everything comes back to me.  I'm an ordinary human being who didn't have the opportunity to be special but in the most important aspects of this life, I have.  I believe one part of that is that we all have the capacity to give up on ourselves.  Because of this capacity, one's mind has the potential to create a story to make the most of our lives. I love the phrase, it's ok to be alone.  I think it goes to the heart of the story.  All the pain, all the sadness, all that emotion is okay as long as it's not too much.  In the end, sometimes we end up hurting more than
