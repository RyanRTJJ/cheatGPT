On Friday night, I went to the movies.
After watching the newest horror/sci-fi, I did the only thing I could think of that would make a difference. I left the house.
The next morning, I brought a plate of breakfast to my dad in the hospital.  

A:

On Tuesday, I left the house,
I went to visit my uncle,  
I ate some pizza,
I spent a day with my niece.  

A:

I leave the house early in the morning,
I eat some breakfast,
I have coffee,  
I take the dog for a walk.  

I like these two options for several reasons:  

 the "I go for a walk" is not dependent on the mood of my dog (he can either do his business where he is or carry poop back for me) as the first implies. It's just a fact of daily life.  And the last line could easily be removed.
 The "I take the dog for a walk" is very easy to describe to friends. You're going out and doing something for the dog, it's your responsibility, unlike the first option.

 

This means you leave my house in the morning,
With my coffee in hand,  
I eat my breakfast,  
I visit my uncle,  
I take the dog for a walk.  

With this you can make a big break:  

 I take the dog for a walk,  I go visit my uncle, I come back and have a coffee.  

That means you leave at 10 o'clock in the morning with coffee in hand and take your dog for a walk. You can describe to your friends that you do it once a day. That also means you'll never be locked out of your house all day without having coffee because the dog always has to go outside to stretch his legs.

 

Or I leave my house at 3 pm,
I eat my dinner,
