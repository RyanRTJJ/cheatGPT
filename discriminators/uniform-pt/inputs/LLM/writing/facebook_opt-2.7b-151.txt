  Or a couple who have a long, loving, intimate relationship.  I don't see this as rape. I see it as one partner being in a relationship with someone else.  I'm not a lawyer, so I'm interested to hear what anyone who is can say about the morality of this.  It seems like a pretty gray area to me.
It's rape in a lot of ways. It's also a case against the concept of marriage.
I would argue that in the same way that marriage is a violation of equality, so is divorce.
It's still rape though. I really wish this sub was about *not* being able to marry someone who you don't love.
Rape is a really really serious offence and the word is used to describe the act of taking a life without consent. I think I might prefer that people not abuse word.  EDIT: People are abusing it. And then downvoting me! Oh lawd!
Is this a UK thing where you're trying to have a logical conversation with a woman?   Also, it's a valid word, and I'd suggest you try to find a better word so that you don't have to feel guilty about using something in which I assume the vast majority of people feel.
I thought they meant rape as in the act.  I actually think the word has quite a bit of merit as it's often used to describe the feelings of one's partner.
> It's rape in a lot of ways.

That is why I disagree with his use of the word. It should only be used in cases where the act of rape is taking place, but does not involve any type of consent.
He could have said "it's rape for other reasons" and it'd still be good advice.
