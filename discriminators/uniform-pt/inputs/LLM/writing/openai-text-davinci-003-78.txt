Once upon a time, there was a princess who lived in a far-off kingdom. She had everything that a young woman could want - a grand palace, luxurious gowns, faithful servants, and jewels to spare. But what she really wanted above all else was true love.

One day, a prince from a neighboring kingdom rode by on his white horse. The princess thought that he was too handsome for words, and immediately fell head over heels in love. She sent out to the prince a rose colored invitation, asking him to meet her at the midnight ball.

The prince agreed and rode to the castle. There the princess declared her love and they danced until the clock struck midnight. But then, when the last stroke rang out, the prince was gone... disappearing into the night like a puff of smoke.

The heartbroken princess spent her days and nights in her tower, pining after her lost love. She often looked out into the night sky, tears streaming down her face, hurting inside and out. But then, just when she had almost given up hope, the prince magically reappeared at her door. He had been cursed by a wicked witch, he explained, and the only way to break the spell was to true love's kiss.

And so, the two lovers reunited and their love was stronger than ever. They rode off together into a new dawn, living happily ever after.

The End.
