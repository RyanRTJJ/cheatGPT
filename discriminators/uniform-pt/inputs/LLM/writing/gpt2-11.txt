This is how you add text to stories. For example, if you have a story where some guy named Mr. Bean's wife happens to be a friend of your brother's, then they would say some kind of explanation for why you're such a great guy. And this is how to add a letter to the same story.

There are a number of similar suggestions here:

The "Dear Letter" option provides for stories where your story needs a "Dear Letter" or "A Letter" instead of just saying "Dear". This is one more option for characters, but for other kinds of stories, it's much better. (x-post from /r/space) Note that this option is only to be used if you are using a story whose author is a friend of Mr. Coffee. (x-post from /r/space) If you make a story that's about a real life friend, you don't get to add a bit of story-telling to it. You don't have to tell Mr. Coffee's friends that the person who actually lives in your house is your friend, but you will make a story. Mr. Coffee is your friends.

It doesn't work with "Dear Letter" to provide a specific way to say "I am your friend... " (e.g., "I wish I never met a friend who lives in your house..."). If you're sending a story with "Dear Letter", you can use the "Goodbye Letter" option so that I see how you respond to the story. (e.g., "I should not have said this because I'm a poor person..."). If you send a story with "Goodbye Letter", send it to someone who said they were nice to me. (x-posts from /r/space)

If your story is about a real life family, I would like a "Dear Letter." (x-post from /r/space) The
