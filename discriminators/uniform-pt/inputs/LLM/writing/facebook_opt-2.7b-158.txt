 This is your story, we don't know these characters, and frankly we don't want you to die.
I'm just asking for a short story based on a prompt I have no idea about. So i'm more looking for the creative aspect of writing about a random set of characters.   Also I didn't say these characters were not to die. Not everyone likes to see their favorite characters die.
But you did say they did not work and it was important because it was your favorite. We don't like when fans die! But still, these are free points for creativity! Write a story, with your favourite characters, but make them all die, or have some kind of bad ending?
Hmm... good idea, but they probably all would've died anyway. I don't like to kill off too many of the main characters, it makes the story harder for me to write on. But I'll see what i can come up with! Thanks for the suggestion.
That's a good way of looking at it. You'll probably just have to make sure they won't die too soon. :) You're welcome, hope you come up with a good idea.
Oh good, i wasn't worried about that at all! I've got plenty of time. Thank you for the help. :)
I know that feeling. :) I try to get my stuff going before it is too late. My ideas are so original, they'll never be original enough for anyone else. ^_^
Exactly! I don't need to outsmart anyone else so long as it seems like a good idea. :)
Yeah, I like to come up with a plan, figure out how to reach the climax quickly to move forward, and then just see where it goes from there.
