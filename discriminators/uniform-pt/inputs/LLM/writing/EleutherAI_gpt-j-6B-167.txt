Story that is made of 

 Frost

To find is the meaning, find it from there

What makes a story is the people 

 The three main characters are people and they make a story.

My story will be a picture, not a story

A picture (of a picture) is an image, but a picture is not a story 

This also implies that a story is a visual medium, so there will be pictures - not only words. 

I can already see

 It's the scene in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs where the dwarfs have to draw the apple from the tree.

I'm thinking of the meaning - the story that is told

You have to be telling your story, right now.  

I can see the characters

It could be Snow White and one dwarf or something more complicated - what do we know? 

There's a boy and a girl, a guy and a girl, a guy and a guy

I know for certain that at least the first two pairs of characters will be two males, one male and one female. I'm assuming that we don't know who the "guys and a guy" is - is it one guy, two guys or three/four guys? This is yet to be determined.

 There's a boy and a girl (from the title), a girl and a guy (from the title), and a guy and two guys, so there will be three of each - a total of six characters.

I really don't know how to continue beyond this point

 I guess you're just playing around with it until you get something that you're happy with.

There's a twist! 

 You know why there is no twist? Because there isn't one.  

This means that

 we get no twist. Yay!
