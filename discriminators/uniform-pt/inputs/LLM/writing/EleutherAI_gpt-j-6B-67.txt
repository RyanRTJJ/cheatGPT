 
Don't forget to put some tags so that people will know your story isn't  
fake. You have one week before college, but you're not gonna have time  
to write a short story, so go ahead and write a novel instead. Remember   
to leave the door to your classroom open and turn off the lights. Then  
open all the blinds and windows, and play soft quiet music. When you   
hear "In a few minutes, the world will change. Nothing will be the same  
again! You will be the author of your story, and you have been chosen by  
them to write this story based on the words given to you. Before you open  
your story, you will be told not to talk while you read, and remember  
who you are and what time it is. When you are done with your

34   
story, close your eyes and picture all the places and people it takes place  
in. When you are finished reading your story, open your eyes,

and sit with the people who will now read your story."

In a few minutes, the world will change. Nothing will be the same again!

You will be the author of your story, and you have been chosen by them to write this story based on the  
words given to you. Before you open your story, you will be told not to talk while you read, and remember  
who you are and what time it is. When you are done with your story, close your eyes, and picture all the places and people it takes place in.

When you are finished reading your story, open your eyes. Sit with the people who will now read your story.

(This is the first of five days, each day being a different part of the whole story.)
