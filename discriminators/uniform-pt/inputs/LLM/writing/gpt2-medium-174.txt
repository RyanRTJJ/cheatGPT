 Do something interesting that you think would make this letter better. 
Example: Write a beautiful novel inspired by your love of cooking. Read The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly from the perspective of a poor man and the woman who gives him shelter.  Tell me what happened, and why it matters. 
What's next?  Write a poem inspired by whatever you want to do!
I've done more than my share of prompts, what do you think?  What were your favorites?  Were there any you'd love to add or edit on a regular basis?
For more inspiration that only works in your dreams, follow my Twitter.  Happy writing, and inspired.
Cheers,
Cody
