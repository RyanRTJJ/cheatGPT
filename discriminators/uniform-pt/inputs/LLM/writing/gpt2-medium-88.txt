The Malaysian investigation into MH370 began with an initial search on March 20th, 2014. On April 6th, 2015, Malaysia and Australia provided search and rescue services over the next several days. On April 10th, 2015, on the flight, air traffic controllers at Singapore warned of trouble, although there were no reported wreckage pieces.

The MH370 case is fraught with controversy, thanks to an investigation that has been dogged by difficulties on land, under water, and in the air. Questions emerged about whether the plane was ever hijacked or even lost while it was in flight. And, as far as the plane is concerned, the truth is unclear.
One theory is that a plane may have flown from Beijing, rather than from Kuala Lumpur in China or Beijing-bound through South Asia, with the aircraft's pilot operating a route that didn't make contact with its controllers until it touched down in international airspace north of Kuala Lumpur. Other theories are that the plane's departure from Beijing may have failed because it was too near the coast during radar contact with its controllers in Hong Kong, a fact that has raised alarm and concerns about radar tracking abilities in these
