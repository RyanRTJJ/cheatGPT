Sherlock Holmes had been such a great idea for a costume this year. Both detective and comic fan, the idea of dressing up as the legendary sleuth for the comic book convention was nothing short of brilliant. Little did I know that this decision would lead to me being thrust into the middle of a small-scale mystery of my own.

The convention was in full swing, the costumed attendees mingling amongst one another in admiration, when a sudden and fierce blizzard struck outside. Nearly immediately the power cut out and the building was thrown into darkness and chaos. Attendees began to panic, their voices echoing in the darkness.

The massive crowds began to thin out as frightened attendees sought for a way out. In the dim lighting of the emergency generators, I noticed a body on the ground. I quickly realized that this was a murder victim. I was immediately struck by fear and confusion as a chill ran down my spine.

The attendees had dwindled down to just a few dozen people now, all of whom had been trapped in the convention by the blizzard and none of whom had any means of escape. As everyone began to take stock of the situation, they all looked in my direction. It suddenly dawned on me that they all thought I was Sherlock Holmes – the great crime-solver – and they were expecting me to solve the shocking murder.

I took a deep breath and got to work. With the help of the other attendees, we were able to search the entire building and gather up evidence.
