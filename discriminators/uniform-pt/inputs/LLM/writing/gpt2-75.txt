*********** *** I feel like you and I are so blessed together because of you. *********** *** I have such love for every friend you've known. *********** *** We don't know how you'll survive this. *********** *** Oh, I'll never stop loving you... *Chuckle* I have a gift for you... My heart is so much bigger than you can ever imagine... *Chuckle*...because you were my love before I ever could have it. *Chuckle* This is the first time in two years, in two days that I'll love you! I love you so deeply, and you've made love with everything I've loved so so deeply, as well as so dearly. If someday you remember me, I won't let you forget this gift... My love has been true to me for two decades, and I could only feel it... I needed this because I've already lost someone dear to me... I need this love in order to make love with you again. There will undoubtedly be a place for you there in our family, I hope to offer you one day. *Chuckle* No matter what happens, I will forever protect you from your feelings. If I ever lose your affection for me again, I will give you my deepest, tenderest desire... for that night... *Chuckle* I can't feel you. I feel lonely. *********** *** I want to make love with you. *** *Chuckle*...and I want to make love with you to the end. Please. *Chuckle* Don't hesitate, don't hesitate. *** In that second time that I touch you, I will take you for what you are - to me again... I will make love to you, and to your heart as long as it takes. (Chuckle) *Chuckle* And then you're still with me. You're my only hope of happiness. (Chuckle) Please... (Chuckle) I won't hold your eyes for long, don't take off. *Chuckle* You have the power
