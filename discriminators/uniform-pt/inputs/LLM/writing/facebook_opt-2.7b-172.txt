 (This could be your "in-game" story, where you have to decide to write this story that someone else might be writing.)  Or write about your own backstory, but you have to write it based on this prompt.
That is a great idea. I will have to try that. Thanks so much!  I'm working on a short story about my personal background, but I just feel like I keep making it all worse. I just need to finish it because you guys keep telling me to!
Good luck, then!  This exercise is good to get your head in the right frame of mind. :)
Thank you! Wish it was working better! My husband is out of town right now and he would have a great story. I just worry that if I share him, it will be "taken" and published.
That will probably happen at some point in your life.  But you write what you like to write, so if you just finished it, it's good.  Don't compare yourself to others.
Yes, I guess.  But I hate having to keep writing more! When I finish, it feels like a waste of time. I'd much rather be editing, but I always get into the habit of thinking I need to finish it and I go to editing and it takes me forever to do anything and after that i'm not happy, etc.   I am so glad I posted here. I'm going to continue and focus on editing, I think it might help me.
This! I keep trying to write but as soon as I get it done I start editing. It's awful. I'm almost 50 and I can't even edit books anymore, what am I doing in this industry?  So, keep writing! Write what you want. :)
That is so true!  I used to be great in editing.  But lately it seems like I hate it, so I just don't.  Oh, the things we do for money!
