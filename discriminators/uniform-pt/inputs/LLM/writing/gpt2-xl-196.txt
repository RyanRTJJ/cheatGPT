A/N: This was inspired by a conversation I had with my husband a few days ago. It is one of my favorites. We're both pretty weird in the "love at first sight" type of way.

In addition to being amazing artists with extremely hot sexy bodies, the thing that we're both obsessed with is technology. My husband's always looking for the latest fad or gadget. I, however, am an artist. I've always been an independent artist, and I love to paint and sculpt. I even have a studio and everything I do is done by hand. And so I began to thinkâ€¦ what would happen if I combined these two passions together? For me, it would be a fantastic idea.

She began to cry into him and when she didn't stop, he decided there was something she did need to know. "Maggie, my sweet. I am here now. I'm so sorry about what happened to you and your friend
