~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (Day 12) Hey there, nice to see you. I just got back from a tour of a shipyard in Philadelphia. It's a pretty cool place. [ IP ] Hey! You can't go that way! It's off-limits to the public. [ IP ] What is it that makes you think they'd be off-limits? I mean, isn't that a little... suspicious? [ IP ] Yeah, I know. No wonder you hadn't turned up. You just weren't ready to leave your little hidey-hole. I guess you've finally gotten the hang of going around without making waves. [ IP ] Yeah, that's all I was saying. So, I got on my bike and headed for some ruins in the area. I've seen them before. I know where they are. [ IP ] I'm not surprised you weren't ready to go. Just yesterday, I heard rumors that the city is having a hard time with its youth, and it seems like gang violence is getting worse. What do you think? Have you seen any action in the city lately? [ IP ] No, I haven't... I guess there's a lot going on right now. I'll check back tonight. But if I find out something weird in town, I'll let you know. I hope something catches you up to speed. [ IP ] I think you make the best out of a bad situation. That's good to hear. You've got my promise. Bye. (Day 14) Hey, it's you! Wait. What? We haven't talked in a while! You've been busy, too? Oh, hey - you didn't get any presents last year either. Well, you're really close to your new roommate, don't you think? So how about a few rounds of beer tonight? And don't make me give you the full credit. You've been out in town a lot, huh? [ IP ] You wouldn't believe the things people just don't let me do. [ IP ] Yeah. I know it sounds harsh
