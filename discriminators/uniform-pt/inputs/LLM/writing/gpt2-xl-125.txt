 The President is convinced that religion is the cause of much of the recent woes in the world.  He wants to ban religion entirely from the public arena, and has asked religious leadership in your country to meet him for an impromptu gathering to discuss the possible effects of such a move.  You are not happy with his plan, and begin to talk amongst yourselves about how to deal with the President and his demands.
The prompts
I find the prompt to be intriguing and thought provoking.  I've had some recent reading on Christianity and religion that left me wondering if its ok to question what the founding of the church really meant.
The prompts are a great way to gauge how your character would react to this situation.  It doesn't really matter if there is a god or not, so how would your character (if godless, or believer) respond to such an announcement?  I want them to have to deal with it as well, so a little thought will go a long way.
It also is a good time to explore whatever issues your character is facing.  For example:  What would his reaction be to the idea that the American people (if there really was such a thing as America) will suddenly start worshipping a figure the President will have to go to Congress and convince to grant him the authority to ban the practice of anything the president deems harmful to the welfare of the people?
This last part really comes down to how you write their reactions.  For example…a typical church-goer will probably react with a mixture of fear, disgust and confusion. That's kind of what this prompts is: a mix bag of responses, some good and some bad.  So, make sure to use
