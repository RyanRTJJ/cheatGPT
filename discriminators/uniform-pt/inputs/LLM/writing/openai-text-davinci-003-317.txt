The gods had been around as long as anyone could remember and their presence had only been strengthened by the dozens of statues and images of them scattered around the world. It was a reminder to the people, of their power and their authority, that even something so grand, so mysterious and so powerful could take a physical form.

But then one day, it all changed.

The last remaining statue of the gods was destroyed. No one knew exactly how it happened, but famed legends tell of a great battle that had occurred around the site of the statue and the last great force of the gods had been defeated.

As the dust settled and the dust and debris cleared, the sky darkened as the gods themselves vanished into the heavens. With the last of their statues gone, they were gone as well.

The people mourned the loss of the gods and their statues, but life went on. New gods and religions came in to take their place and new myths were created to fill the void.

But the people never forgot the stories of the great gods that had once been here. They never forgot their power and their presence, a reminder that even the most powerful can one day be brought low.
