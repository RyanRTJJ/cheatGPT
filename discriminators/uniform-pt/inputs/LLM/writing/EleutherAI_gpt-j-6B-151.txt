 This mother is having second thoughts about becoming a wife-mother.



A couple of years after the wedding, the woman has a baby girl and a boy. She realizes that she misses not having a father in her life when the kids are young. She feels guilty for missing out on motherhood and decides to divorce her husband, but she doesn't want to take any of the children with her.
