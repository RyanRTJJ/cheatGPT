For this prompt, decide on the character(s) and how you write them.  What are their traits.  You need to decide on a character (such as a main character) that you like.  These traits are your inspiration as to the character's traits and how the character should be acted upon.  Here are the traits I picked: The main character (the character you're going with) loves to rock and he/she is not afraid to get dirty
(the character you're going with) loves to rock and he/she is not afraid to get dirty The supporting character(s) are pretty cool and have cool-but-not-too-cool-things about them.  (Examples: a girl who loves to act pretty and an artist friend in the town who is a weirdo)
I think my favorite part is that I could choose whatever my best friend of mine says (and vice versa!).  I think it's funny too...
