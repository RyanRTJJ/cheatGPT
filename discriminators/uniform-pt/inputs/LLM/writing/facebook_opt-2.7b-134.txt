  But you must choose the monsters yourself, because they must live with you for the rest of your life.   Make it interesting. Make it terrifying.
It all depends on my mood when I start writing, but I like the direction youre going already. The "we must choose the monsters" kind of got to me, thanks for the suggestion!
You were able to choose the monsters when you wrote the story. You could always choose them again.
Well no not really. I think I just subconsciously started subconsciously doing these posts I guess
That's what I'm saying. All that matters is that you pick the monsters and that you let those nightmares live with you because they were your choice.
If I do it again I'm definitely gonna keep that in mind
Good. Make them a part of you forever. Don't let those monsters into your life. You owe that to your family, especially your son.
I see, I guess it will be better for me to think about my family before this. But I'll do it again if you're not against it, what are some good first drafts I could check out (that aren't super well known)?
Oh yes of course. It's a very good way to go about it. I've heard that writing a draft every day is the best way, but if you only feel like writing a snippet or two I can't blame you. Just keep it in mind.  As far as good drafts go...I always thought the best part of writing was that there was no right or wrong answer when it came down to good writing just a different way of going about it.
Hmm I like that. It was just that my first draft took around half an hour haha
