________________________ In the third generation of Avalon, King Arthur meets Queen Guinevere. The queen tells Arthur of her own sword, and he decides to ask her for help. She promises she will teach him how to wield the sword. She wants to give it to him so he can finish it by himself. At the very last moment, she sends King Arthur a spell that gives him immortality. Arthur uses the sword of the legendary King Arthur to defeat the forces of Chaos in the Middle Ages, defeating them all but for a single knight. He uses this sword to defeat his father's army... and it has given Arthur great power. __________________ In the fifth generation of Avalon, King Arthur and Queen Guinevere set sail aboard the Avalon of Avalon Castle... A ship that will be his only hope that he and Queen Guinevere'll escape the destruction. His greatest fear is now complete: he has become a hero. _____________________________ So, you're all ready to tackle this challenge? We have some challenges that are based around Arthurian tropes.
