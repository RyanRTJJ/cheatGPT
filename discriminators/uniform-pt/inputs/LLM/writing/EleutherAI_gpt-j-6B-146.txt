 
The Devil takes you to the time when evil reigned supreme and tells you all about it. There exists a magic stone containing the key; but to reach it, you will need to sacrifice the last remaining good man on earth. As the Devil tells it, it was a time when a young boy lost his life and nobody gave a shit except for that boy's parents and the Devil. As his story goes on, you become numb with shock and horror.  
When the Devil finishes the story, he gives you your freedom â€“ but tells you the boy's sacrifice was a "mere trifle" compared to what's coming next. He tells you you must tell the boy's parents and offer your soul to him in return. His reasoning: as much as it sickened him to cause the boy's death, the young man still lived for the boy and the boy can be used to create a new world. To find this boy, you must be the boy's father. You have to be born with a stone that will give you the power to reach the key. In return for your soul and the power to see the future, he can give you one minute to find the boy. If you fail, then you'll see everything he sees.  
The Devil leads you home. When you arrive home, you find your family dead. You have no choice but to give in and make the deal. You're told that if you don't you'll watch the death of your entire family...
