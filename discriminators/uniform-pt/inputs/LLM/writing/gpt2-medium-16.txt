Don't talk to him till you've tested it at least a certain amount. He's too stupid to think of it. Or a man who sees what can happen to you and doesn't react. Or who thinks too fast when he walks up to you.


You think your job is to give orders and don't give orders.


You're supposed to be a real man; not an idiot.


You're supposed to know your limit.


You're supposed to walk away - before you get hurt - when you're done thinking this is what you have to do.


You just are a man; no matter what everyone thinks of you. -John's Story

I am the man Who makes no mistakes

In a world of imperfection - A man who never regrets; A man of light and fire -John's Story

I am the only hope on earth -a man of steel

In a world of disaster - A man who sees, understands and heals

In a world where peace and the people's faith has gone out of style

So I make mine own

But I love my sons too much -John's Story

All the time I look in my mirror at myself

My eyes always ask the question...

"What am I?"

You're here with me tonight; you'll find out

The answer I've been wanting - John's Story

I am the one who gets the credit

I would pay money for a lifetime's rest

Just to make sure nobody got to feel like they couldn't change - John's Story

I am the one who made everything perfect - John's Story

I am a man who fights to the end - John's Story

God, I love you so much....

Please believe this - my tale all written in my own words

I am the man Who makes no mistakes.
