"This" isn't the whole article The article doesn't contain all of the facts about why the story has taken off, but it does give an idea of the sorts of questions we are asking. For example, "How do you decide what to investigate?"

Or: "What are all these people out there who agree that the way to heal is through meditation?"

You're welcome to respond. But please note we will not be re-publishing your comments or questions, or changing the headline or introduction unless you have posted them in response to previous postings.
