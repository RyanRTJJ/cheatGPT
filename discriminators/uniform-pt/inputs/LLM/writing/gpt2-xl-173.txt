"I felt very uncomfortable with myself and with it being my night. I got on the bus on the way the the city center and then I felt something grabbing my arm. I was startled and scared of the sound. I grabbed my arm again and the same thing happened again. This happened several times that I was in fear of being raped. We stopped at a dark area and I began to panic. I looked up and the person in front of me was watching me. She whispered a strange word in my ear and she got off the bus. That's when I knew that she was a ghost and I could read her mind. I was terrified. I ran in the dark of the woods. She was chasing me, looking for this time to stop me from getting to her. I felt very afraid, like I just wanted to go home. She did not stop me and I ran until I found a very small path leading into my family's house. I was scared to go into the family's house because there is a room filled with ghost, some of them are very violent and want for nothing. I do not want to scare anybody with my story but I do want to know something else. And that's why I posted this! If you think you could help me by sharing my story with me, it helps me feel much better. Please, share this story with everyone you know who has
