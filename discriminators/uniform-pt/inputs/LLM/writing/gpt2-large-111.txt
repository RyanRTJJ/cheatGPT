 There's nothing left to do.  And now you have a bad feeling about it.
4) How do we know if a book is complete
In a previous question we asked if readers know if a book is complete, and this question is also for self-published authors.  Is each page of a manuscript complete? Is every scene, word and character completely written out?  Of course not!  But they do have to know, so you need to make your own decisions about when you should know or when you won't.
5) Is one chapter too many, one story too long, or one chapter too short? Is one chapter of a book "too long", "too short" of a story, or something in between those two extremes?
Each author has his own ideas about each of these questions.  Some authors take more liberty with short stories, many authors take more liberty with novels, some take more liberty with novellas or short stories, but all are bound by the same criteria.
Now that you've learned as much as you can, it's time to get started.  Here are our top 5 rules for self-editing a novel:
1. You must choose a genre: Do you want to write books about sex, family, or historical themes?  Do you want to write novels set in outer space, fantasy, science fiction, or fairy tales?  Do you want to write short histories, poetry, or essays?  It doesn't matter -- just pick a genre.
2. Be precise: When choosing your genre, you need to be precise about what you're doing.  You can't be too precise with something that you love.  If you want to write a romance, for example, you won't want to write a book about love.  Your "love" will become a huge hurdle for you.  Use common sense when selecting your genre.  And if you want to write fantasy, don't be a complete jerk and write a book about a magic sword-wielding
