I'm a cheerful inanimate object, and I love my job. I'm in a small bakery, helping a family create delicious treats for their customers. Every day I watch as the children fill me up with flour, sugar, and other ingredients, and I witness the magical transformation as they bake their treats - pies, cupcakes, cookies - I'm always so proud to help! But today was different.

Today, I heard a scream, and the family frantically began running around the kitchen. Curious, I watched as they frantically shoved each other, trying to find something that I couldn't see. Then, suddenly, I heard a gunshot. I shuddered, never expecting this kind of violence in my peaceful bakery. Through my wide, glassy eyes, I watched as two of the family members stopped shoving and looked up at the ceiling. But I could only make out one figure - a figure slumped over in a chair, blood dripping from its head.

The thought of a murder taking place in my peaceful bakery was too much for me to handle, and I felt my cheerful existance slowly fading away. I watched, in shock, as the family frantically tried to cover up the crime, and I felt my heart break for both the victim and for the family. I couldn't believe this had happened - a terrible murder committed by someone I trusted and cared about. 

The police soon came and took the family members away, and I was all alone again. My cheerful demeanour had vanished, replaced by a haunting image that I would remember forever. This was something I never expected to witness in the bakery, and my existence would forever be changed by it.
