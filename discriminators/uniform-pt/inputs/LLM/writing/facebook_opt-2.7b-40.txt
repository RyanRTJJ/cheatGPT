 You're there now and you want to tell your parents that this room is where you grew up in and were safe there.
A simple room... With a strange door.
I'm not at all sure I'll remember the details of what happened... but I'm sure they were horrible and something terrible happened there and that is why I'm a little scared.
You can remember the exact location it was in then. And if it was in the attic it could of been an attic room because those rooms had windows. But a good way to find out is to check your old diaries.
How do you plan on getting a hold of a diary? My parents threw out all of my really old ones and the only one I had was probably from 4th grade, although I'm sure a lot of it was trash.
Try your old friends or search your relatives name on the internet through their social media accounts.
I went to my older brother's house and my mom's friend, but the house is super far away, not to mention my mom's friend lives nowhere near me or my brother, I don't know anyone else's contact info.
I would have to put your name on their social media if you don't want them to find this.
They have kids so I doubt they'd do that, I figured my other option was just to look up an unsolved mystery/mystery post and see if the name showed up.
I'm sure you wouldn't be the first one to ask them that since this story is actually really popular on unsolved mysteries. But yeah do it and see.
I'm thinking I'd rather avoid it and try to figure out the real answer myself with a random internet stranger. I think that's probably right...
I'm sorry you're going through so much right now but I hope there are some mysteries left unsolved just for you.
I'll keep an eye out for the one that really sticks out to me, I appreciate it.
I wish you the best of luck and feel free to reach out if you need to.
