  Is a big game like GTAV or Assassin's Creed Brotherhood being released soon? If so, you need to write some great and interesting events that will occur.
Actually, there is a new AC game set to launch next friday (ACIII).  I think I will just be making up some random scenarios now and later, and see how they play out.
Make sure to share your finished work. I'm sure other people can find a use for it
If I have time and I come up with something I like, I'll probably share.  I hope to make some good ideas out of it lol.
Well, if you end up with anything for the game you made, I'd love to see it, but either way I'm going to look forward to either way!
I could maybe post some details or an image or two, but it's not complete (as you can probably tell lol).
That sounds fine to me! Looking forward to it! :D
Thanks.  I'll probably be going into work early though, so I probably won't get to it tonight.
That's fine! As long as the next installment gets posted, that's all that matters, in my opinion.
I'll try for tomorrow.  I think I know what one thing might happen and I'm kind of trying to figure out what to do with it.  If it goes over well then I will probably just post it.
Awesome! I'm excited to hear what you come up with! Any and all opinions are welcome, don't feel obligated or anything, as long as they're constructive and not just 'lol ur stupid bro' nonsense.
I think I'm just gonna throw most of a bunch of random stuff together and see which one I like best.
