The subway station was abnormally crowded with people running in all directions trying to catch their trains. I was standing there, struggling to make my way through the mass of people when a voice suddenly filled my head. At first, I thought it was my own thoughts, but when I heard the words "Kill them. See them all stopping in their tracks? They heard it too. Kill them before they kill you!" I knew something was terribly wrong.

I looked around, frightened, wondering if anyone else had heard the voice. But the station was deathly quiet, with everyone frozen in their place. It felt like the world was holding its breath.

I continued to make my way to the platform and suddenly the voice came again. "It's do or die now, they're coming. Hurry, or they'll kill you." I began running, faster than I had ever run before, to the platform. But before I reached it, I felt a sharp pain in my back.

When I woke up, I was on the platform with a broken rib and surrounded by confused faces. Some had heard the voice, while others hadn't. The subway was sent on its way, and I was carried out of the station.

The doctors say the voice I heard was a warning from my subconscious, warning me that I was stepping into danger. I guess it was a warning that saved my life that day.
