Â It is the best possible result for Death and Death wishes to punish you for not realizing his lies forever.
For the next few days, all the things Death wants you to do are accomplished. Death shows an almost joyous happiness, smiling to himself while sitting at the throne. Death says the oath he made to his sons in death was for them to live forever in their dreamland, or he must die. After killing the evil god-king, Death offers the young warrior to be named a knight. Death wants you to try and become the next man to kill him. Death says killing him might make you immortal again and that you might even be able to keep your memories. Death says fighting him would only make you stronger.
After the battle with the old wizard, Death says he gave you this sword to fight. Death makes you swear not to steal it or you'll die on the sword's blade. Death says it's a sign that you need to learn these words "Life ends when you go dead." Death tries to give you advice, but gives it to you slowly as he's still confused and concerned by your current relationship with Death. After your quest is finished though, you must wait until midnight.
After having gone into your dream in bed, you wake up in another room with no memory of what happened during the night. What was going on is that you never even knew who you were, or anything happened to you, or anything else, at least that's what you thought it was until someone told you that you have this thing that makes you feel immortal, and I don't know if it's true or not.
After this happens and nothing else happens, Death leaves your bed.
