The idea is that if you spend a little time travelling, you can change history so dramatically that you can re-create the past and even alter your own future. Now I'm not suggesting you must do this. However, this is an exercise that can help you remember that there is another way if you want to remember that your actions changed history. The premise goes like this: In 1945, the United States entered World War II as a neutral nation and fought to the bitter end. It did lose a number of battles as war continued on, but that didn't stop US President Joseph Stalin from building a "new type" of weapon that could destroy the US. Stalin had never actually considered the possibility, but his superiors persuaded him to do so. The weapon was in fact a fusion bomb (though it didn't become known until a week before Hiroshima). The bomb would make a hydrogen bomb the size of Manhattan, which in turn would create a far larger explosion. The weapon was also set to launch on 9-10 July as planned, but instead was delayed due to the nuclear destruction of Germany. Instead, it was postponed for another month to July 19. Stalin was told that if the war continued, a nuclear "mother of pearl" would be triggered in New York City. Though the war was coming to a close, the US still wanted the bomb tested to see if it was sufficiently safe for use, and so Hitler agreed to the test
