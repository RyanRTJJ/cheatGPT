  Now, your task is to live out the rest of your life, never again interacting with other humans, and never revealing that you are an alien who cannot be trusted.  What is the first thing you would do?

No guarantees....  That is a wise man. What would your second act be?
I'd probably go eat. Lol. I don't really have one, I just thought of this prompt after thinking of the prompt that was given lol

What happens with your mother when you find out?
I'd probably leave the city and walk around for a while until I found an abandoned island. Lol. That's about all I can think of.
Don't get too attached to it. I suggest you make your last words to me, "What a nice girl. I think I might just fall in love with her." ...I should probably go to sleep...
Lol, have a nice sleep.  But...but, don't you get attached....you said that you loved someone.  Edit: Lol, you said it! Goodnight. I love you.  [](/celestiawut "No but seriously, go to sleep.")

Why would you do that?  Is it like a test or something?
Well, most people always think about their past or future, or how they
