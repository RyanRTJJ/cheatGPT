 Don't.  The dollar-sign is the clue that it was bought once, never to see again. Don't swear like that  because you don't know.  You'll know something is wrong when you buy it.  The fact that $ appears does not change the fact that you haven't been there a long time. The word `shit' doesn't change the answer to the question about the dollar.
It's a phrase in a variety of languages, and I don't know what other words you should use  to describe it.
You swear at me  by the weight of a single dollar in my grocery bag or purse. It takes me so long to know we're going to have no more food, and that that food will give me the next, bad one  . It doesn't matter if you know me or not. But I swear.  I know this.
You are more likely to be told to drink, the person who has you here.
You have an eye on me  in my head.  This does not matter whether "you" is talking to me or not  as to the man who is making me drink, or if I'm a lie-er than you, or what's actually going on inside you like me like you were saying. Don't.  I know this shit is coming out.
You swear too quickly without any real understanding of what they're doing to each other  in an attempt to keep you from knowing what makes you stop drinking.
You are looking for something that can hurt you, and I'm here to make you feel like you might be.  (Remember, like when I'm a mother's little sister?)
You are looking to be accepted as a stranger by a friend or family.  I don't trust people who will take anything for granted: I hate people who accept the idea. I don't trust people I can count down the days until some date or some act that will help and not do me a disservice.  I don't trust people who will always give it their best to me.
