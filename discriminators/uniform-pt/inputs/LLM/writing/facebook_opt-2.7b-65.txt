 *cue up the sad violin*
That's too specific for a story.
If you have a good story based around this you will be considered awesome.  I'm not asking you to do it,  I'm just saying you should go for it.  If you want to hear a story about it PM me and I'll give you some more details.  Also I just saw you're from England, I don't know anyone who hasn't thought of ending their lives at least once.  What part are you from?  I can also tell you stories,  they'll be good ones though.
Can you please not give away the ending mate.
Sure, it's not that big of a deal since it's only for me.  In the future I can see it going to the newspaper so it doesn't have to be a secret anymore.  And anyway most of my stories are based on current events so it won't hurt anything to tell it to you now.  I'd much rather you hear it now so you don't have to worry about remembering it when the time comes.   Sorry if this isn't what you asked for but it's all I got to share.    Good luck anyway.
No problem mate.    Sorry I didn't respond.  The best way to start a conversation is telling them how the conversation is going, right then.    I've already had a couple of experiences where someone felt they were going to commit suicide, so it's good to know how to react.  Anyway, no worries, you were probably just tired or something.
Well I guess I can't say no to you.  I've been wanting to be your friend since that first message.
So how did it turn out?  Did the guy hang himself or just go on a binge?
He just went out on a binge.  I tried to give him help but he was too much of a pussy
