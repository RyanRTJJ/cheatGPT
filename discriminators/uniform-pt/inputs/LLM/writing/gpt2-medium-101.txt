I can't wait to catch them all on the web with their work.

So happy to share some of our writing.

We still have an order for 8,000 words at about $50 each. We will ship all the way to Oregon with a 1/2-hour flat rate shipping. I'll keep track of shipping costs when the order total comes in after the fundraiser closes. Please include a message with your order and any extra shipping costs to help us achieve our funding goal.


We have now released an add-on for PDF reader (it is now free!). Click here for that PDF.

Finally, a few details to wrap up with today. Here goes!

My brother-in-law has been volunteering to contribute his time to make this happen. It took him over a month, but in the process he wrote several blog entries that are now available for anyone to read. You can see them here in the blog post about them. He wrote a couple of posts to help us get started, so here's your first glimpse into his personal writings.

All these links are now fully linked in the blog post that I posted last night.

I wanted to leave you guys with a link to a video from last night called "Why I Love You". I made a short clip from it recently because I think it's really funny.

Here's today's quick look at our latest project.

Polls will open in two days and close tomorrow.

I started putting together the first set of links last night, but then found this lovely blog that has awesome articles on various topics. You can read some on one day, some in the next, some on any day, and so on.

All the links below are at the top of the blog post, but if you scroll down, you can scroll down and get a few more.
