Mrs. Frizzle had been a part of their lives for as long as they could remember. She had been their teacher, mentor, and friend. She had taught them about curiosity, exploration, and most importantly, adventure.

So it was only fitting that as they assembled at her funeral, they all wore the signature red dress she had worn throughout her life-- no matter how much her style had changed over the years.

The former students gathered in a circle, hands on each other's shoulders, and memories of their beloved Mrs. Frizzle began to overtake them. They remembered the spontaneous field trips that were nothing short of extraordinary; the calmness in her voice when talking about the sky and its constellations; and the countless laughs shared.

The students were proud to have known her, and to have been shaped by her. They were immeasurably sad that she was gone, but thankful for the time they had together. Mrs. Frizzle had left a lasting influence on them all, and they were eternally grateful. Her memory would live on in all of them.

The ceremony came to a close, and yet no one moved an inch. It was the first time in a while that the old students felt so connected, and Mrs. Frizzle was the one not to blame. She'd guess played an integral role in their lives - and so they stood, basking in the sun, letting the nostalgia consume them.

Mrs. Frizzle had left her mark on the world, and her former students would forever remember her. They'd simply smile at each other when they thought of her and whisper 'Mrs. Frizzle, we miss you so.'
