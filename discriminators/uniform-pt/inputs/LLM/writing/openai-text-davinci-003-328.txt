I always knew my closet was magical. I'm not sure when I first figured it out, but it's become part of my life over the years. Every now and then, when I'm feeling nostalgic, I'll open the door and take a little walk down memory lane. I've had it since I was a kid and I remember how excited I was the first time I opened it. I found so many forgotten trinkets inside and felt like I discovered a secret, special world.

But despite this special relationship, I'm still fairly certain I've closed my closet door more times than I've opened it. Every time someone goes in there, it seems like something new and exciting is happening. Whether it's new clothes that magically appear or a cardboard box full of memories from decades ago, I'm always left in awe by what's inside.

I think this is the stuff that dreams are made of. Every time I open up the door, I'm stepping through a portal into a new world. I never know what I'm going to find inside, but I'm almost always pleasantly surprised.

It's been years now since I opened up that door. I'm still fairly certain I've closed it more times than I've opened it, but I know that when I do open it, I'm sure to find something special on the other side.
