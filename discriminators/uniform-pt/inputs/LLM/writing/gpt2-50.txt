~~~~~~ I believe he's in your lap!

I love animals and cats, and we all care but we have one thing in common. So, please, love a dog or whatever you want to call it, come on in and show us how nice and happy you really feel about it (without going into any details as to whether a dog is a cuddly puppy or a dog is a man. Just say "YES!" on a picture.)

If you are a fan of some of my other videos, my "Hood of Love" and "My Animal Companion" series

If you have a dog or cat and want them to be your pet, please let me know.

You are totally welcome and if you aren't sure if what I do is right, what I do is what will hopefully solve your issue of being an animal lover or being a non-animal lover.

How can I save my dog a picture??? How do I save him a happy life that I can enjoy at home without putting out too much traffic and without him driving home in my car in his backyard!! And how many other things should I include to make him happy and satisfied?! (You will have to do this. I can't ask for it all, but my dog will enjoy every second of it all.) Please help me make a special one for you all!!! This project isn't a sponsored item. Every dollar the project gets helps me make it a reality. If the project is successful, I will personally contact you if you would like to be contacted. If everything goes well and I am able to add
