 Or, you may write about a man who is having an affair with a married woman who he met at work.  You may include a few of your own personal notes about these people before starting. (Make sure to list their names too!  I had one that I really liked and then I didn't want to bother her parents when she was married so I used "the other woman" instead.) Here's the prompt: A single mother, married to a man she does not love, decides to move out to live with her daughter in a tiny farm house by the river.  Her daughter wants to live in an apartment; she does not want to live in the dirt. She is struggling to make ends meet and has no experience in domestic work so is reluctant to take the job.  On the day she is moving in, a man from the nearby city comes to the house.  She is able to convince him to help her with the job by showing him her two daughters and an apartment that she did not have before.  Will this man help her and her daughters live the way she is wanting and do the job right? When finishing, use a photo of your family, or whatever you've chosen to represent your situation and write a short story in your own style from that picture.  I'm not asking for a traditional story, but if you choose to use one, give it some weight by including any notes I've suggested above.  That way, we can judge the story for ourselves and make any needed changes before submitting.  There's no penalty for submitting a story with too many changes; once they are in, as long as the writing is good, they will be reflected.  That being said, if you find your story is riddled with typos and/or are having trouble sticking to any structure set forth above, please change or delete those paragraphs now.  As always, please remember that my rule of thumb is if the story is better with fewer edits, it's worth using.
