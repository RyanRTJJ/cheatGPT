Hints:

      * A fictional location, be it in a library or inside a home. 
        * Make sure to write a dialogue to show the characters interact with each other. 
        * Be careful with grammar and don't make it too poetic but not too dull. 
        * When writing the description of the setting, provide details as you would have observed in a real wedding.

# Write a story based on this prompt!

Write a story centred on this theme.

# Example:

A man and a woman decide to buy their first home together. As a wedding they travel to London together and enjoy their newly purchased house. The following paragraphs illustrate the first day of the two having their house decorated. Take a look at the following sentence and see if you can draw the same kind of scene.

# First day of the first house 

The house they built together was the first house I've ever lived in. The woman went in and started to decorate the walls, the chairs, the tables, and then they sat down to a lunch they'd saved in the fridge. They ate with cutlery and all kinds of utensils and cutlery that was quite fancy. And I did not do this. I just sat down and ate my foodâ€”just like I do in the kitchen just like I do every single day.
