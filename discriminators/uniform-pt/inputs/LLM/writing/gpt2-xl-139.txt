 He has the same struggles of a person living the real world today.
What I get to write: One hundred years in the future, with a futuristic world of genetically grown super humans all running for office, living in apartment blocks built in the style they wish they could have 100 years ago.  The main character, who is running for office, is a scientist from the past.  He spends his time looking down on society, being a bit bitter about it and looking for a way to change it.
When can I submit: September 11th!
How much will it cost: 
I'll be charging $5 for each chapter.  If I get enough submissions, it'll be a monthly gig.  If I don't, it'll be done a little more frequently.
How many will be written: Probably around 500.  I don't know how long each one will be.  It'll depend on the number and quality of submissions
What should be in it:
There will be no plot spoilers in the chapters.  Characters will be referred to from time to time as needed.  If you haven't read the novel, you'll be able to read through the story and know what's happening, no matter what the future world looks like.
If you would like to give feedback on the story or suggest a different idea for a future novel, please message me on Discord (linked in the sidebar) or email me at gregwilliams.editor at gmail dot com.
