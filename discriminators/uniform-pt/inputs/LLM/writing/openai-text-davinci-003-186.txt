s future

Christina couldn't help but feel a heavy weight of responsibility on her small shoulders, ever aware that the decisions she made in life would shape the future of another person entirely. She had been given guardianship of her younger sister when their parents had passed away a few years earlier, and now that the girls were both young adults, her choices had the potential to make or break Chloe's future.

Every step Christina took, from the classes she attended to the job she applied for, had to be considered with an eye for her sister's wellbeing. When it became time for her to begin her college career, Christina knew she had to make the right choice, so she instead chose to stay closer to home, so that she could be there for Chloe every step of the way.

Armed with grit and determination, Christina began to put her plans into motion. She worked hard in her studies, taking advantage of every opportunity to become educated and prepared to enter the workforce. At the same time, she poured herself into her guardianship of her sister, taking on extra-curricular activities so that Chloe could be involved in a positive environment and paving the path for her future success.

It was not an easy road, but a few years later, Christina's hard work had paid off. Chloe was succeeding in her own studies, and Christina was on the cusp of completing her college degree and starting her career. With her sister's future secure and her own well on its way, Christina could really start to appreciate the importance of the burden she carried. Shaping her own future, in turn, she was transforming hundreds more down the road.
