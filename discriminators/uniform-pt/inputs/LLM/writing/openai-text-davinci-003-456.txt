He was gone too soon. After leading a life of kindness and helping those in need, Olaf had left this world. There would have been a glorious welcome for him in Heaven for sure; a place for a kind man like him. Or so he thought.

When he reached the Pearly Gates, he was met by St. Peter. But there was no trumpet fanfare, no jubilant cries of celebration. Instead, there was a somber atmosphere. St. Peter said with a grave expression, "I'm sorry, but Heaven is full. There is not a spot left for you."

Olaf was stunned. He had believed that if a person lived a good life, no matter how short it was, they would be rewarded in the afterlife. But that wasn't the case. "What am I to do? Where will I go?" he asked Peter.

Peter replied, "Unfortunately, Heaven is finite and its space is limited. We had to draw a line somewhere. I'm sorry I cannot offer you an eternal paradise."

Olaf was crushed. He had heard the rumors of Heaven being overcrowded, but he hadn't given it much thought. Now it had become his reality.

Depressed, Olaf turned away from Heaven, his hopes for an eternal afterlife dashed. He found himself in a limbo between life and death, with no clue what to do next.
