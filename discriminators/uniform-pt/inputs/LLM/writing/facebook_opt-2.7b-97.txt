 And, please, don't get too creative: a character who died at the hands of another character who was the most likely to die at their hand would be a bit far-fetched. The protagonist shouldn't end up killing a god.
Or a god, if they're into that sort of stuff.
"Do you think that being the most religious person we know might be a downside?"  Edit: "Do you think that being the most religious person we know probably isn't a downside?"
"God will judge us all. But you'll be the LAST person we'll judge. And as such, God will give you an awesome, awesome life."
You can judge yourself for how closely you follow the tenets. I'd judge mine if you live up to it or not. But if you don't, I'll judge you for not at least trying.
If you've read the New Testament, you'll know that Jesus was actually more or less like, you know, just a dude.
Jesus Christ was both human and God.   "Babylon is the crown of the world. You shall break the neck of the Serpent and strike his head and he shall die"  -Jesus Christ, The Bible
Yes, because that's Jesus. Which is the entire point I said when I wrote that: he didn't follow the tenets religiously. Jesus was God incarnate. You can choose to believe this all you want, but in no way was Jesus Christ following the commandments religiously. He was in rebellion against religion.
This is about his teachings, not about whether he was God or not.
I can't really give you a coherent argument that he wasn't religious.
Then don't, and stop discussing it like it's a discussion.  Jesus had a *precise* message: *don't die*. To all the people in the world who will die, **you die**. Don't die.
I'm just asking for a reason against you saying he wasn't a practicing religious person.
