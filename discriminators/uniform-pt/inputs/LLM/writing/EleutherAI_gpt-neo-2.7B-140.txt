~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ “The world is my theater, and we are the audience, while we go about our daily business and our world comes alive with possibilities.

When Daisy tells George that he needs to leave immediately to prevent them from being caught in the rain and drowning in the river, he responds, “We are both going away.” Is this an example of a perfect marriage?

Or are we to believe that Daisy did not go away in this situation, but, instead, she stays on the train and waits for George to tell her that he loves her. What does that say about her relationship with George? Can we draw some of our own conclusions by seeing her as “unideal” in this situation? Can we consider this story as reflecting our life with someone who has said “We are both going away?” What does it say about our relationship to say, “We only see each other every 3 years.” And yet, our relationship is not like Jay Gatsby’s relationship. We, the audience, get to decide that we choose to stay in the show. And what is that saying? We decide to be unideal to someone else? We choose to love someone who has said “We are going away?” To think there are no consequences for our decisions while we stay with someone else without choosing to leave is to live in a fantasy world.
