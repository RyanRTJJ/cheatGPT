Â for the experiment: a bomb would go off every 90 minutes for 7 years, so that, in that very short timeframe, every vault would be tested, and the one that holds the treasure would be chosen. After 5 years go by, all of the machines will have been destroyed. The vault doesn’t move, just shifts a little. You notice there are a few items that seem to be missing, as well as a new vault that has yet to be discovered. Now, you have two objectives: 1) Find the new vault. 2) Do your best not to lose the treasures. If you succeed, you win a new chance to find the vault by a process of elimination. If you don’t find it, you have to spend a lot of time and effort in order to make up for the time already lost (and that’s if you didn’t get the vault).

(You can’t win if you are “lucky” and succeed.)

Are you a practical guy who tries to do the math so that he can figure out the answer? Or are you willing to tell it how it is, that you’ll be sticking to your guns, and that you’ll play the odds, even when they’re not particularly in your favor?

(Practical guys and girls will understand if they don’t know you very well. They likely won’t know they don’t know you very well if they don’t know anyone very well.)

(Don’t be confused by the word ‘lucky.’ Lacking something doesn’t make you unlucky. Just that the thing you’re lacking is a very important element, and you’ll be a much better person if you figure out what that is.)

I tend to be one of those guys who would say "This is
