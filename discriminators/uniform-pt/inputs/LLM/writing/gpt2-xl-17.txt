-------------------------- *No one has ever died for a crime, not even a death penalty victim. There are so many loopholes in this system that it isn't worth being honest about how it works. It's not like the system was set up to just wipe everyone away from the planet. -------------------------- If you're bored for more prompts, drop me a line, or better yet, comment on this one, I love to hear from people :)
Note: This is only for those of you who are interested in this. No spoilers. If you are into spoilers, you most likely won't care about such a story.
