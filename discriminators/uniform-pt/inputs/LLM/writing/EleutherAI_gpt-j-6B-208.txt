Write a short story which tells the story of the funeral as seen through the mind(s) of just one human. 
What are the things you notice upon their death?

It has always been my belief that when one dies, that they return to whatever it is that created them.  It's only the body that dies, they still exist.  In this case, it would just be the body.  Nothing lasts forever, all things (including us) have a beginning and an end, and we all move on when our time comes.  
One day, as a part of the collective, we simply die, that doesn't mean the end of us, just the end as a part of the group, and a part of this world with all of its problems.  What goes on with them after that is up to them, but I can't imagine things going well.  I see them going on with life, which at some point would end as they have to be reborn to move on with the other sentient beings, but, they have no life outside of the collective.  Some may have gone their separate ways, but they are all bound together by the collective anyway.  

 Just because the end of the collective doesn't mean that all of them die at the same time, their different times are dependent on each other.  They all die when the current timeline runs out.  

Even though I couldn't imagine what happens, I know that one day they'll have to die. 

 They all do but they'll just continue to exist in the collective.
