 Today you get a message (the message is hidden) that says, "You have already lived the good life. Take it up. You have a great chance to be the hero. Now we need you here to save the world."  Tell a compelling story without having too many exposition.  This is not a "real world" type story, and you aren't trying to get a serious point across--rather it's a story where the only real character you have is yourself.  Also, you're a stranger.  Do you really want to have to explain to your friends why you were chosen? I didn't include story ideas that only apply to a single story.  A few ideas will pop up repeatedly on this site, so don't feel the need to do them twice. This prompt is written by my friend Sarah Smith.  It's a quick flash story with lots of background and a few details that can be edited later in your draft.  Here's Sarah's email: SMA
If I were to be given a choice, would you be my next hero? A. It's going to sound silly, but I'd be more than happy if you were, too.  I just like to get my hands dirty and get really involved.  And, yeah!  I'd be more than happy to help out. B. It might be hard, but I think you know what you want even if you've never experienced it.  I love to experiment with different things and see what works, and I'll do anything to help you achieve whatever you're aiming for. C. I think it's safe to say that I only know five basic human behaviors.  For most of my life, I was obsessed with one: getting in shape.  I've never been a huge fan of exercise, and I've spent most of my adult life chasing a very thin line between "healthy" and "weak" -- so I'm a little hesitant to say that I'm going to be your next hero.
