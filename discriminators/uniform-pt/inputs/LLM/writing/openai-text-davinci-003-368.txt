Once upon a time, the world was very different. At one point in human history, the population of the planet had maxed out. Nobody could conceive a baby unless someone else died first.

This harsh rule caused outrage and panic, and many people tried to break the law. Even though natural deaths still occurred — such as due to old age or disease — it was still a challenge to keep the population where it needed to be.

The governments all around the world found ways to encourage people to use birth control and find other solutions for increasing population. They enacted powerful incentives for people to work together to find ways to decrease the population legally.

Agencies were formed, laws were passed, and ads were run to promote responsible fertility. Slowly, the population began to decrease and resources became more accessible and plentiful.

Though it was a difficult period, the people of the world eventually came to see the necessity of their actions and found peace in the solutions that were made. After a few decades, the population stabilized and everyone could enjoy the luxury of having children at an old age.

No one ever anticipated the extreme population limit that had been set in the world, but the planet was thankful that a solution had been found. Without it, who knows what would have happened to the human race?
