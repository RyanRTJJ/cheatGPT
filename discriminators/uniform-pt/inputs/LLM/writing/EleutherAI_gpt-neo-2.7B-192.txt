  
It's my belief (so far, at least) that everyone—even me!—has made mistakes. Yet the thing we fear most is that one of us will make a mistake.   
I remember vividly one of my first days at summer camp, at about 7 years old. When I saw the school bus rolling down the hill toward me, it took me a second to get it in my head that I was not going into that bus at all. It took another second to decide that I was going into that bus, and a final second to get up from my spot, scramble out of the pine forest that I had been hiding in during the whole day, and then—as I was sitting on the bus seat—I realized that I had made the mistake. I started to cry.

All through my childhood, until my teens, I had believed that I was different and better than the people around me, and better than them—just different. I had internalized this line of thinking that I was a special, separate being. When I left home, I had made the decision to be an adult. I wanted my own life and I liked what I had made. Once I was no longer on probation, life on the outside was not too bad, although it was nowhere near perfect. The years I spent on a strict treatment program for "numerous" sex offenses—that's how long I spent locked up—were far from perfect. To me prison is supposed to be a punishment.   
I believe now that I am a special being, but I was not always so special. I did not always see myself in those terms. And I did not always see myself as less than. But then again, who ever really knew what they were when they grew up? You don't have the perfect answer about who you are until you grow up. By
