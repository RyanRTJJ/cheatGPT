There are many other similar situations, most people just don't care. -------------- Part 9: A car gets caught up in a tornado. A group of the locals try to stop them and start evacuating with help. They get destroyed in the process.

Another random, unexpected, but fairly obvious example. -------------- Part 10: A plane crashes into a building, then crashes as well.

There are many more.

To give you another quick taste, there are a few situations when situations could be a little worse, if we only had a little more data.

In all of the above instances, we only have the last person's actions that we know the police are looking for.
