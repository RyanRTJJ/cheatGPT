Well they don't know that this isn't about them. They're alive but just not in the way I think they are.
Let's begin with the obvious. I've spent the last few moments working on something. This isn't like writing something in a book or the like. It's about the world. This isn't going to be a story about the good guys. This is about all these bad guys with the good guys. It starts with the story editor and I write about the evil villain, and you know what happened? I didn't make him. When I didn't get the word I turned my pen in. The pen got cold. I knew there had to be some type of mechanism to make it work. I knew it was a long story and that it's going to be the worst sort of thing to write, but I knew I had to figure out a way. 
There are a few options. I could find a pen and paper. 
A book! One of my childhood dreams, I think, has been to write a book. But there isn't much there. There isn't any character I know or think or find interesting. I can't use my imagination. It would just suck. So I started with a phone call.
What if I gave you fifty million dollars?
The phone call doesn't come from anybody I know. I get an email at 1am that says, "I've received your email and I think you can use my computer to rewrite it." I get to the door and there is this very lovely woman who has written these beautiful letters on the back of the letterhead of the magazine she's working for. She is dressed beautifully, and her eyes are sparkling. I walk in and I give her 500 bucks and she says, "It's my dream!" She has a beautiful flower print dress, and it is gorgeous to talk to her on the phone.
So I say "I believe in anything you say and give my money." She says "If you give me one star I'll write what she writes. If you give me five stars I will give you the script," and she puts the script to me,
