Trouble

You are accused or convicted of a crime and you can't remember whether or not you committed it, nor do you remember a sentence or time for trial.

You are convicted of a crime and you can't remember whether your sentence was too light or too heavy, when you were found guilty or not, were you given your due, did you have to pay if you got caught or have any other reasons for a "no."

You are accused of an offense (and you can't remember when and how the offense happened or whether or not you committed the offense with knowledge of the details) and the circumstances are not clear.

You are arrested and taken to court. This
