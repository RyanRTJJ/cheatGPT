Once upon a time, there was an aspiring author. All of his dreams and aspirations revolved around becoming a world-renowned writer. He would spend days and nights writing his stories and his books, all in pursuit of becoming the great mind that he imagined he would become.

But then, tragedy struck. Due to a series of unfortunate events, his final collection of works were never published. His dreams of becoming a great novelist were now gone, lost with the unfinished pages he had written.

Years passed and his works were forgotten. Eventually, his stories and manuscripts became nothing more than great literature turned into litter. His stories from his books were littered in the streets, forgotten and trampled on by passersby.

The aspiring author, now an old man, would often lay awake at night and wish that he could have realized his dreams. He was heartbroken every time he looked out of his window to find people disregarding his works, throwing away the stories that he had worked so hard to create.

It made him feel as if all his hard work was in vain. However, he still had hope that one day, someone would pick up one of his discarded manuscripts and fall in love with the stories he had written, and his legacy could begin anew.
