All my life I had been fascinated with the memories I can recall that weren't my own. I was never quite sure where these memories were coming from or why I even had them. They all seemed so real, and I could recall the details with startling accuracy, but when I would tell people about them, they assumed I was either making it up or I had a really good imagination. 

One day I was chatting with a family friend, and I told him about one of the memories I had, and he said he knew who it belonged to. He told me I had a sort of sixth sense and was a Recollector. He said this meant I was able to absorb the memories of those around me and it explained why I had vague recollections of people and places I had never encountered. 

As I began to actively seek out more of these memories and learn as much as I could about my newfound ability, I also decided to use it to help others. I began working with people who had memories that were too painful for them to remember, and by absorbing them, I was able to help them move forward without having to be constantly weighed down by the past. 

I may not know exactly where my memories come from, but the fact that I can use them to help make the world a better place is a beautiful thing.
