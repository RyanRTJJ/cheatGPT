 There is a new child with a baby brother, and they are playing in the garage.  They look at the car, and all of a sudden, they see a bright flashlight shine through the window.  You can only hear the engine, but now that you hear the sounds, you know that it must be a child's flashlight.  Please feel free to revise this story for additional details about the new vehicle or other aspects of the scenario:
The next morning, there was a knock at the door.  It was time for your morning nap.  You opened the door and saw a new baby boy with a large baby brother.  He is wearing a blue baby blanket and is holding a flashlight.  As you stand over him, you hear the engine again.  You're terrified, wondering where they are, but you know that the parents are outside.  No, don't panic—they can't hurt me.  They know that in my mind, all I can hear is the engine. What do you do?  You close the door, and open the refrigerator.  You search for something to read, but the light will not be able to see through the fridge door.  Can you see through the screen? What about the window?  You decide to call for help first.  All of a sudden, all of the lights in the garage are on, from within the car.  The parents are at work, and you don't realize it at the time.  You quickly open the door and let them in.  And now, this strange man is inside the house, holding the new child.  He wants you to tell him that they are playing in the car for a few minutes and that all is well. What do you tell him? They are about 12 weeks old and a little older than the oldest child.  They appear to be normal, so he can't see much. He is dressed in the clothes that the older children wear.
