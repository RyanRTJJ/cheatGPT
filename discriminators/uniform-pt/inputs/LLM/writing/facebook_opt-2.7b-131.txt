 After the end credits roll, you hear Kennedy laughing in the distance.
Sounds intriguing, but I might want a backstory.
The button opens a portal that allows it to take the President into another dimensional plane. So that's the backdrop. But the button is an evil genie that's been living in the White House this whole time. And it wants the President to grant his wish in order to release his genie from prison.
> But the button is an evil genie that's been living in the White House this whole time.  The genie wishes for:  [1] the president to never forget what the button does  [2] the president to keep his eyes closed when he pushes the button
And after the president becomes president, he never opens his eyes again.
So he gets the job that he actually wants?
I hope so. Cause people are just now realizing how cool it would be to be president, imagine thinking it was just a job for life before this
I don’t know man. Imagine being president of the united states for 10+ years, and never getting to see your son play in a football game, or be there for your grandkids birthday parties. Just all the shit is for sure gone forever. I don’t think the president is the kind of person that gets over it
But it’s cool you can fuck a hooker in the oval office and do drugs if you want. Who does that if they aren’t an asshole.
I do all the time with a hooker named Michelle. The fact that I can never see my kids when I’m there because the door always opens by itself, just thinking about it hurts. God I need a life.
