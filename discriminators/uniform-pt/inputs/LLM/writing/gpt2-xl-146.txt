_____________________________________________ The best way to get your ideas out there is to write about them. When you write about it, you get feedback. When you get feedback, you refine your ideas.

What are you waiting for? Go outside! Find someone to go do some gardening, and go write about it! Share your ideas with the world! Have fun!

Happy writing!

It is great to be back again with an idea for a comic – even if it is for a random drawing. The topic is very dear to me and since I can write from my heart, it is actually a very important topic to discuss with other comicists. So I am trying to find inspiration from the most random sources and try to make it into an actual comic and I hope that you will like it!
