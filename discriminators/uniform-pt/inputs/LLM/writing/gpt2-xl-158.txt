 Someone offers to take care of it for you, but you know that they do not. You cannot afford more money at the moment, though you know that you can go to the marketplace. You find a watch in the market place that fits you.  You begin to worry if your watch will be a nuisance until you find out that the watch is actually your only means of information gathering for the time. 
Write a story about your characters learning or exploring the technology that they were given by their creator.  Any genre is fair, but I'm starting to be a bit curious as to what you'd call it in the story.  Something with a bit of story, not just a technology description would work out well.
Write a story about a villain.  This is not your typical, "sick of evil" villain.  In some cases, a villain of your origin or one you are creating is the villain.  In others, your villain is a former ally or a new character of your origin.  The villain does not have a specific motive for the villainy.  They are a villain because that is what the story wants them to be.  Don't go crazy in this one, just like it's not that complicated on the science.  Any kind of villain is good for this prompt.  I like to use a few kinds of characters as villains to get you thinking.
Write a story about an NPC who's the star of the story.  I usually mean it's the only person you talk to about the story other than the author.  This character isn't the main character or even the main supporting character, but they are the one you see the most.  They are the main personality in the story.  You get to know them very well and want them to have some good times.  Or maybe, you do like their company, but there is something more you want to do than hang out with them.  They want to learn something about yourself.
