It was the late 21st century and every corner of the world had been engulfed in fiery flames of war. Mankind seemed to have failed in finding a path of peace despite attempts at negotiation and diplomacy. Desperate to stop the suffering and bloodshed, a peculiar figure emerged with a radical plan to bring stability and coexistence - the doctor of time.

With a few peculiar gadgets, Dr. Time set out to rewrite the Bible and Quran â€“ the two most contentious holy books of our time. He knew that many of the holy wars had been sparked by the misinterpretations of these two books and if he was successful in eliminating the discrepancies, then he could save mankind from future wars.

Gathering mystical essences from unseen dimensions, he began to fathom the secrets of the texts he sought to edit. He noted that many passages contradicted each other and by removing the inconsistencies, he could create peace. Every page and every footnote were carefully examined and each version was fine-tuned to create a unified version of the Bible and Quran.

Exhausted but triumphant, Dr. Time released the two books to the world, hoping that its inhabitants would learn to respect and accept each other's faith. To his delight, his delicate manipulation of time truly paid off. Peace began to spread and many areas that had previously been torn by conflict found solace in international understanding.

It was then up to the people of the world to continue the legacy of peace through coexistence. Dr. Time had taken the first step in his time-travel mission and together, mankind finally brought an end to the desperate and destructive wars plaguing the globe.
