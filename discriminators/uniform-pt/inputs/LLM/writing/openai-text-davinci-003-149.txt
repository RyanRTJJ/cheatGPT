I was a strange child, I always knew that. While everyone else could only see the signs of things to come, it was my nose that tipped me off when something was about to happen. 

At first, I couldn't put a finger on it, but I noticed that I could tell when a storm was brewing or when a power cut was about to happen. I was the first to know when something out of the ordinary was about to happen. 

I kept this ability to myself, afraid of the reactions people would have. But as I grew older, I started to understand my unique ability and its implications. I was able to tell when danger was near and when something unexpected was about to take place. 

Most people can only see the future, but I can smell it. I can sense the scent of things to come, like a sixth sense. It has made me particularly alert and able to stay one step ahead.

Unlike seeing, smelling the future requires trust and practice. I'm still learning new things every day, and still trying to figure out the subtleties of this gift. But I'm grateful for it nonetheless. 

The future can be a scary place, but I feel a little more secure when I can detect things before they even happen. Some people can see the future, but I? I can smell it.
