!!! Death stares back and then at death. He's staring at his feet right now. I've been staring at his body for over a year. It looks like it's in pain already. The only thing I can do is hope he's okay. This is his only hope, he must have loved me, after all. I should have let Death die in the last week. I love you Steve, I love you. The memory of Steve the kid starts to disappear into my heart. I still feel sorry for him and I'm sorry I was so mad when he passed. I'm scared to death the first time I see Steve but then when it comes time to talk to somebody I'm just glad he passed. The only thing I wanna say about this interview is that it should be an easy question to answer. The question now is to know where death came from and how he found his way back. The reason he is so desperate and I'm so sad there is any trace of him has come to this. I wish I could just hang as many people on the other side of the house and watch the whole thing happen. That's not what I know. The most I can do is tell everyone who was there how much it felt like Steven was there last night at the dinner party. What's so sad is that Steven ended up dead, and my hope that this would never happen to anyone else like you. I'll never stop praying that the last time the memory of Steven is played was a good one. And you guys have no idea how good my plan is. It's a little sad, but I'll be there when it's complete.
