What did B say to C?

You know that it's going to end up the way I have, right? I've always loved the Forge Lands so of course it came back as my world. It seems so easy when you say it out loud in your head, like the story just wrote itself. My friends are all gathered around, listening. Most of them are trying hard not to giggle. The rest appear as I did when I was a little girl. Their expressions are hard to read, but I don't have to read very closely. I recognize my own face in theirs and wonder, as I always do, how I look to the people who know me all too well. Who knows, I might be smiling. A few months past and I would've been too young, but I haven't been old enough for such things for a very long time.

"This is going to cost a fortune." The youngest says this, trying hard to be serious.

"It's nothing. I mean, it's more than a day trip, but we have time to kill. What'll it be?" I make a big show about showing them each an example of my new Forge Lands book. I've gotten them all to read it before. Each one tries it on their own and I get the same questions: where are we and who owns this place? How do I teleport? Does magic still exist? And the biggest one that always trips me up: what if I don't want this to be my world? Can magic be undone?

I answer each of the questions a hundred times.

"Trust me, you really, really, really want this."

"If it's too good to be true, it probably is."

"This time, a promise is a promise." I laugh.

The youngest, a boy my age, rolls his eyes.

"You're pretty, aren't you?" He says.

I like that they all look at me
