 I want to put what the book has to offer into the context of today's world.  The story of a young man who saved the world is not just about the one individual who took his life and turned it around so that it might be one person.  It is about the future.  It is about how you go about your own destiny as a human being, how you react.  There are far too many details in this story to cover in one sentence, however the book does the perfect job of showing us which is which.  With some basic information drawn from my experience at the book signing process  (1-2)   a person on the other side of a conference line is going to feel that they have done their homework and this was not the case with my other volunteer leaders.  They also knew when they said they were going to meet up with one of my leaders during the day that they would need to go to the bookstore to read the book and their manager would have some kind of special offer from the bookstore they needed to get one of their leaders out to read the book (3)   if they had a problem doing so many times, they would give it to one of them during the day that day and they could be in the book store a few hours later.  Each person in the group had their own problems, however some needed to wait a couple days to get and talk to their friend in the library, others in the group could wait in the mall or bus station to get there when everyone else needed to stay at home.  They did not have a problem doing the same without having to make this decision at the start of the day with the books already on
