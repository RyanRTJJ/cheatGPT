 You always put off planning your letter (which is exactly why it matters so much on a deadline); and you'll regret that later when you finally get it done!
Choose a book to read.  You can choose a sci-fi or fantasy book, as long as you have a specific favorite author and it fits the theme of the prompt. 
Write a poem about what the book tells you about yourself.  This is your opportunity to say something that others might not say: "This book says that I'm a bad person." or "This book says to me not to drink." Don't be shy.  Come up with your own reasons for writing the poem, and stick to them.
Include an excerpt from the book in your letter, and the letter should be the word count for the letter.
Please keep in mind that this is the most basic letter writing, and you are on your way to writing a lifetime's worth of letters!  I have two more book prompts to post!  Please make your first Letter Writing Challenge a success!  I look forward to reading your letters, and I hope and pray that you have the time, discipline, and energy to complete this challenge and write a book.
Sincerely,
A Letter Writer
