His friends had been working for only a few days when a dark figure approached them one afternoon. They were both young, roughly seven years old, two brothers in their late teens. The young man was taller, and the older brother was thinner than their little brother. They were dressed in the clothing of the poorer urban youths. Their clothes were dirty, their faces scarred with a lifetime of petty crime. The younger brother wore a green polo shirts and faded blue jeans. His older brother, a large man with wild hair, sported a shiny black leather motorcycle jacket, complete with chrome studs. The man grabbed the younger brother and gave the older brother a kiss on the cheek. The older brother quickly reacted and began to shake the man, while trying to shake away the kiss. The man grabbed the little brother by his hair and squeezed, pulling him toward his friend. The little boy screamed. The older brother did not stop, still holding the child's hair and twisting it. He then grabbed the young boy by the pants and began yanking them down, tearing them from the smaller boy's feet. "We are going home," the older brother said as he released the boy's jeans and
