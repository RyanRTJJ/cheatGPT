A:

This is a rough draft of an idea for a poem. It's more like an "improvisation" than a finished, edited poem. There is no rhyme, but I didn't use rhyme because it does not add much, and I'm not sure how well the two lines work with each other. You will need to expand on it and make some decisions as to whether or not it is what you want.

From the very distant past
  Into the more present day,
  We remember the day in time
  That we were born:
  One moment's day in the past
  That is now, today, before us.
  Today we remember:
  On days that are now,
  Of days that will always be remembered.

Note that the first two lines rhyme, and the second two rhyme as well. What this means is that it's a four-line poem with a rhyme scheme of AAAA, and all of the lines have the same rhyme.
Here's the first line, and the first part of the second one.

One moment in the far-past days,
  Into days that now are,
  From days which are now to days to come by,
  One moment in time, once a-day
  We were born:
  One moment in the past is now
  Before us:

The last two words in the second line are also repeated in the third line. Notice that this sounds off to my ear. It seems strange to me to try and force two lines with a rhyme scheme into rhyming in just three lines.
I would write like this:

From very distant days
  Into the present days,
  We remember the days we had
  A moment of time before.
  One moment in days past
  Are now to forever be;
  We must remember them;
  This very moment we be borned,
Because this moment in time
  Is yesterday, today,
  And yes! we remember
  This moment is now:
