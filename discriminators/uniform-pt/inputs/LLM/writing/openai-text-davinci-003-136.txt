The sun had gone down and it was night in the desert. A small group of men emerged from a rocky canyon in the desert, their faces glowing with excitement and anticipation.

They had been travelling for days, and now the long journey had finally come to an end. For ahead of them in the moonlight lay a mysterious oasis in the sands of the desert.

The group's leader, a brave and wise man, stepped forward and held up his hands.

"Look," he said. "The humans have come. Be on guard and remember, no one must know of our presence here."

The group followed their leader's instructions and crept forward, eyes and ears alert for any sign of danger. As they approached the oasis, they could see a strange glow emanating from beyond the palm trees.

The group paused and looked to their leader. He nodded his head and stepped forward, leading the way into the heart of the oasis. The others followed closely behind, their eyes wide as they beheld the grand and mysterious sight before them.

The oasis was filled with hundreds of humans – men and women, boys and girls of all ages – gathering around a large fire in the center. They were dressed in the colors of the night sky, their faces illuminated by the flickering flames.

The humans had been waiting for them, and their greeting was one of warmth and acceptance. They welcomed the travelers and embraced them as one of their own.

For that was just who they were. One human family, gathered together to face the darkness in the desert night, united in their common destiny.

And now, the journey had ended. The humans had come.
