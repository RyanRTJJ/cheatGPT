Once upon a time in a faraway realm, there was a paradise like no other. Souls resided there peacefully before their time in the physical world, happily content with all the creature comforts they could possibly desire, knowing their role and purpose in the grand scheme of life and feeling the security of collective acceptance. 

This sense of perfection, however, was only attainable due to draconian laws and strict enforcement. The only punishment anyone dared commit was the 'birth penalty', a fate that meant being taken away from the peaceful utopia and sent to the physical world as a human being, with all its joy and heartache and struggles. 

But as with any institutional system, some people thought they could get away with their transgressions. Unfortunately for them, the enforcers of the realm’s laws were always one step ahead, finding those guilty and delivering swift justice. 

One such person was Jerome, a wayward soul who had been caught doing something deemed unlawful by the realm's higher-ups. There was nothing that could be done to save him from his penalty — but that didn't mean the people gathered around him couldn't show him a bit of love and kindness as he prepared to take that fateful journey to Earth. 

There were tears, of course, as everyone said their parting words and wished him luck. But soon after, everyone was back to their daily routines, comforted by the knowledge that, at least in this realm where perfection reigned, justice was always served and all would be peaceful once again.
