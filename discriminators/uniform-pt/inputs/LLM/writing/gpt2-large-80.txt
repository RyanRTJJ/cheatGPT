 Imagine such a world as your own: If you were to decide a year from now that you really enjoy writing books, would you also write a series of novels about an established character, or would you write a new novel all about the main Character, who happened to die a year ago, who is currently suffering a bit of a mental breakdown?  Please pick your poison! And please keep your choice a secret from whoever might read it! I know I said we couldn't tell people your choice, and I was pretty angry about it, but I'm sorry if you're not thrilled about your choices. You can keep your choice secret from the rest of the office, but you can't keep it from your wife. I'm pretty happy to give my spouse advice about how I want to spend my time but won't tell her how the rest of us spend our time. So, no one wants to lose their next book to someone's brain. For all you new readers out there, you're doing it right. Keep your thoughts to yourself. And, as always, I'm here to help you find your next project.

My preference is that you write a trilogy with three or four of them: A. The first part is the adventure story. It would
