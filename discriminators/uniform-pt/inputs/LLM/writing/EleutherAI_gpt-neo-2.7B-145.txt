Guard is known for carrying a lot of weight. If she were to be punched, everything she carries would be dropped to the ground. She is one of the most feared fighters in the village. She doesn't talk much to anyone, and can be harsh with the kids in school as well as her husband.

### What would happen if someone tried to get rid of Guard?

Guard wouldn't let anyone get away with it. She would just drop everything to the ground.

Guard lives by a strict code of conduct, one that has been passed down for generations by her family. She is one of the strongest, smartest females in the village. Being the only girl at the high school has meant that guards a lot. Being the smartest one in the high school has meant that guards a lot. Being the strongest one in the high school means guards a lot. As an example, if she were to tell you to drop your book, or if she were to tell her husband that he is worthless, he would most likely drop the subject. Because as we know, that's just the kind of thing she would say without thinking. Being strong means guards a lot, so guards a whole lot.

Some of my favorite things about this story were the way she would pick apart the weak points in people which I liked. She was tough love as well. I felt protective and protective is exactly what she was.
