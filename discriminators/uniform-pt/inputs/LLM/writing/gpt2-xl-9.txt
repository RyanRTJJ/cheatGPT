 Why does he do that?  I'm glad you asked, dear reader :) I don't think I've ever come across a comic-book story that is so obviously inspired from a film, and that would be great if it were ever taken seriously.  I'm hoping someone somewhere will take "Ghost of The Dead" seriously one day, and give us a real supernatural origin (I know I would) or at least a character from the film who turns out to have a connection to the story's events, and then let us tell our own story because it sounds awesome.
5.   I Am A Hero
This is a bit more of a "fan-fiction" than a whole story, so the plot is very basic, but I thought it'd be worth taking a crack at and maybe you'll like it, so I'll stick the description here:  This is a story about one little boy whose dad passed away and whose mother is a hoarder until he grows up to be a teenager.  Then life changes for him, however-in a small town and with a few very strange neighbors, the boy has a chance to leave a long-forgotten life and finally become a hero.  Why is he a hero?  Because he's willing to step up, to work for his sister...who's a hoarder.   Please let me know if you like this!  I haven't yet, but I'm very excited at the prospect of writing it.
6.   The Legend of the Dragon
Okay, so this is a different type of story, but still of interest:  An adult girl with a boyfriend, a little sister, and who dreams of seeing the "dragon" (the one that killed her, but we don't get her name) that keeps haunting her in her dreams.  You can see exactly what she's talking about here :  https://www.shadyacreepublic.com/the-legend-of-the-dragon
