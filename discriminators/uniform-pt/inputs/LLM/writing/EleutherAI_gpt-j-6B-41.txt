As if I should be surprised, I found myself thinking about the first time. It was during a moment while the two of us were talking. If I remember the moment correctly, I was going to ask her something and she was distracted on the sofa and I felt like I was trying to approach her when two things happened. She noticed I was about to ask her a question and she leaned back and laughed. It took a few moments for me to realize what was happening. Her laugh had made her boobs jump up, pushing them outwards; they bounced across the sofa with a bit of force. I suddenly felt quite nervous for I had no idea what would happen next. I then watched with amazement as my best friend spread her legs so that she could lay on the sofa with her knees up.
I sat on the sofa next to her. As I sat there I noticed her legs stretched out from underneath her, but I couldn't see what her feet were doing because of her knees. She was playing with my hair, moving her hand in circles. Once I had a sense of what she was doing I didn't feel too bad as I knew she would stop soon. As her fingers moved so did her hand. She made a circular motion, tracing a figure eight; I had no idea what it stood for, but I figured it must be about sex...but no, it was about friendship.
I then felt her right hand starting to move up and down my neck, going around and around. I couldn't see her doing this because her body blocked out even more of what was going on. Suddenly I felt her head push forward a little and her hand then slid off so that she only had fingered me. As she moved her hand off my neck her head was pushed back again. Now she was playing with my hair again, only this time her other hand was pushing my head forward so that it started to come towards hers. Her body started to sway upwards
