I like your prompt and I have one for you too  > write an angry poem
Hate when you write one but never post it for others to read
> never post it for others to read  I wrote one, posted it. I am a man of my word! So you better write something mean now!
We did it! We made a person sad!
I'll see what I can come up with. I will update you!
Good work, but you're getting downvoted so not many people will see!
The truth hurts.
But at least you made them think ;)
Maybe I'm just doing good at what I do.
This is true, you're certainly doing a good job at making people feel
I have no problem with that. When people are down and out and have a need, I am open to fulfilling that.
I also would be, it's nice to make someone happy if you can do it!      Edit: just to provide an example, a while ago I read a couple posts that were very touching, and after I read the comments the guy in the top comment replied with a thank you so the thread was full of positive energy and it made me feel good to be a part of it!
Thank you for the kind words! You really brightened my day for me. I love making people happy.
That makes me happy, you're really great that way!
No you're great that way!
Thanks, you're welcome!
Are you taking a break from reddit?!
It's not been a long while! Just a couple days. I've just been kind of busy, you know how it goes.
I do! You're still on my list of favorite people on here ;)
Thanks, you're too kind.
