You have some typos on the title page; I will leave them because they fit.

 Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 lands in Beijing Airport, 3 Months late - 
  passengers claim to have flown as normal. 

I think it's an interesting story; here are some comments from it:

What makes you write a story like this?

 I love the concept, and I find it interesting. I think it works because it does not read like a traditional story- in more ways than one. First I think that when reading a story like this, your expectations are met because it is not expected and it does not take you the standard path: boy meets girl, boy loves girl, boy wins girl... it does not follow that predictable path. In fact there are very few points at which your normal would expect plot development. What starts as a typical, plotty travel story turns into a non-linear flight of emotion. I suppose that's a part my bias as a writer.

What genre is it?

 Non-linear travel story, in my opinion.

What are the characters?

 3 characters. The airline, the pilot, and one passenger, one of two passengers who actually gets off the plane in Beijing.

Is there a message behind it?

 The story is more about the effect the flight will have, and how the characters will cope with the event differently.
