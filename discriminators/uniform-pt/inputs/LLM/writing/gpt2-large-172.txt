______________________________________________ | | | | | A story about a young man, who goes exploring the | | | desert. The purpose of this story is to make you | | | curious about how | | | a mystery can happen in a story. There | | | not a lot of clues, but you have your pick of | | | people that happen to be there. Things will | | | get tough, fast, but you'll eventually make it | | | back. | | | | | Be prepared to play a bit of roleplay | | | here, as this story isn't for novices. | | | | | You'll have to fend off some pretty | | | | tough bandits and the occasional deadly | | | | crocodile, but it's a good challenge that | | | | gives you plenty of moments to think. | | | | | | You'll learn several valuable lessons while | | | | exploring the desert, both good and | | | | bad. | | | | \_________________________________________________________________________/ ------------------------------I've compiled this page of questions and answers, to provide answers and guidance to the most vexing questions in this game, and the answers that I find myself asking are just as confusing as the questions or problems they are trying to solve.
