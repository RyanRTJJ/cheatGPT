 Make the character, and then go from there. The worst place to start is when you're trying to create a character you can identify with.
Thanks - this is a great starting point for a story for sure. Just the first scene that popped into my head.  :) It's a struggle. I am working on it though.
I agree that the first scene is the most important. If you can nail it, then you can move on.
Awesome! Thanks for the help. I am a first time writer, this is a great kick in the pants!  :)
Glad! That's why I'm here. To give me a kick in the pants. It happens to me far too often. :)
I'm really enjoying the advice and support. I'm feeling much better about this project than I have felt in the past.   :)
That's awesome! I love helping people. Let me know if you have more questions.
I've got plenty of questions, and I promise to ask them. You might be able to help me find the answer to a few of them.   I'll keep you posted!
I hope I did. I used to write short stories for a community newspaper when I was in middle school. I miss it sometimes.
Hah same here, except it was a school newspaper. I miss it too. :) I think the best part, aside from the writing and the collaboration with other writers, was the community. I learned what it felt like to read the eyes of people going through very difficult things, and it made a HUGE difference in me at a pivotal time in my life.
That is absolutely true. It takes your mind off of your problems, and focuses on the positive in almost every situation. I miss those days a lot.
Yeah, I miss it too. I still think about writing a short story, but after going through the past year and a half of a family's difficulties, I think I need a break. At any rate, I feel pretty darn good
