This entry was curated by the talented and generous Morni MacKenzie, contributor to the A Song of Ice and Fire forum as well as A Song of Ice and Fire Official Podcast, the official podcast of A Song of Ice and Fire. (I am not sure if she is one of the authors listed, but there were five people in the Authors, Editors, and Contributors section so it could have been.)

If you like this, thank her. If you want more, then she welcomes fanart and writing of any kind, including fanfiction. (Feel free to send a message here too and, to keep the discussion civil, I ask that you keep the topics clean, tasteful, and to any extent respectful. Some of this is going to be NSFW, so feel free to be creative with gender roles/hierarchies if you want to make it work, but please avoid inappropriate content and the kind of language that would get her kicked off the site.)

Author biography: My name is Morni MacKenzie, a fanfiction writer and I live in the Pacific Northwest, in a tiny little village called Bellingham. I am a long time reader of Westeros, and have written/commented on the fandom since 2010. I am not an expert in the world; I'm a casual reader, like countless thousands of other fantasy readers before me. Though my passion for it extends far beyond the books and TV shows, (which means that I might say that my passion for the fans far outstrips mine), I really hope my blog can serve as a resource for those interested in studying the fandom. I don't know a lot about fandom, but I do know where to find information and advice, and hopefully help you when
