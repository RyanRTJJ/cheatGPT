The two of them were an unlikely pair, from different worlds connected by a single emotion. The first, a sociopath; a man of minimal preconceived notions, a human bundle of impulses and imagined fantasies. The second an immortal, a figure trapped in time, an island in an ocean of fluidity.

The sociopath was frustrated and unfulfilled, held back by societal constraints, an inability to act out his fantasies held in check by consequences. Whereas the immortal, who had already lived through every consequence, faced few real ones anymore.

And so, it was not such a surprise when they met and their friendship quickly blossomed. The sociopath delighted in the immortal's seemingly infinite capacity for unexpectedness, knowing that anything he proposed was entirely possible, a playground of endless possibilities with no real risks or risks that could be easily rectified.

The immortal too found companionship in the sociopath, as they had an understanding of one another, a mutual appreciation of their similarities. They could talk openly of their frustrations and fantasies, of the things they dreamed of doing but had been unable to, of the power and control they often lacked in the real world.

And so, together, they found ways to act out their fantasies, with no fear of consequences that the sociopath had once known. The immortal would take part, often pushing the boundaries of what was considered acceptable, sometimes even providing suggestions that the sociopath could never have imagined.

And so, with each passing day, their friendship blossomed; a unique union between a creature of extreme impulse and an immortal with no limits. They were an undeniable team, one like none other, unrestrained in a way that no one else had ever been.
