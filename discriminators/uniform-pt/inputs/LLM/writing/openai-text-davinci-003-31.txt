Jane had been having a pretty normal life so far. She had grown up with loving parents, and was surrounded by good friends. College had been a successful pastime, and she was graduating soon.

But despite all this, she still felt as though something was missing. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but that emptiness wasn't easily filled. As she sat in her dorm room late one night, she heard a muted voice in the shadows.

"Everybody gets one chance to press Ctrl+Z on life," it said. Before Jane could even begin to process what the voice had said, her hand was reaching for her laptop's keyboard. A moment later, the familiar sound of the Ctrl+Z command echoed through her head.

Whatever this power was, the time had come to use it. Closing her eyes, Jane imagined the kind of life she was meant to lead. Her vision expanded and became more vivid with every passing second.

She saw a future surrounded by loving friends, facing challenging new opportunities, and living a life that truly fulfilled her. With her eyes still closed, Jane pressed the Ctrl+Z command once more and awoke to find a new life waiting for her.

The feeling of unlimited potential embraced her and overwhelmed her with joy. From that day forward, Jane embraced every new adventure that the world threw at her and, with Ctrl+Z, she was able to make sure that those adventures were only of the positive kind.
