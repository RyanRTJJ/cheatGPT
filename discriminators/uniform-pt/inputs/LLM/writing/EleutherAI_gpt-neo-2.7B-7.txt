 
Write one word (up to 10 words) about this journal, that is appropriate to the style and genre of the story. The word must be related to the vampire and the journal.

I'm looking for a word choice that's appropriate. I know this has an echo to the prompt name from Vampire Diaries but we don't really need the word to be from the journal. If appropriate, I'd like to use the full journal as a backdrop in my book if you don't mind! 
For an example of a good word (I'd like the word to be a word from the journal), I'm thinking of the words "knee deep" or "moccasins"? 
The journal is about a vampire and there is the use of black-and-white photos and some of them of the journal pages which are mostly filled with "knee deep" and the words "this is kitty cats" under them, which is to say they're not particularly clean. The title of the story is going to be 'The diary of a dark night' so a word that evoked black-and-white photos of the journal pages would go well for it. The story would also have the words 'kitty cats' and maybe the journal word "knee deep" which is also a word from the journal. 
I'm not entirely sure what the mood of the story is going to be?
This is for a literary magazine, so I don't want the word to turn too mundane, but I'd love it if the word was appropriate.
Here's the prompt name and the journal link. Any ideas to write this story (including the word) would be very welcome. 
Thanks so much for taking the time to read!
EDIT - just found this from a google search, it looks like there are a couple of words that might be of interest to vampires and vampires in the future. Any thoughts on any of them?

Felt - in its context, this almost suggests an unpleasant experience in the vampire
