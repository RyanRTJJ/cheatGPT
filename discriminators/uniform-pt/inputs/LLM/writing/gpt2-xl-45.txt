Comment below! :) The prompt: The author has a character that seems to be immortal. Everyone knows that as their bodies begin to wither away, they die. For thousands of years these immortal people lived in relative peace, all but the greatest threat to their immortality was a plague which slowly decimated their population. When the world was at peace again the people of this time wanted to have some fun. An organization named "The Society of Immortal" was formed which set out to create a world where everyone was immortal. They created a great many new benefits to ensure eternal life. They also made sure to get everyone to agree to their rules. Eventually a man rose to power and realized the full potential of this project. A group of his people started a conspiracy to get rid of him, but they soon found out that they would need to do much more than kill him. The Society quickly gathered all the people who were interested in immortality for that first party in their grand plan. They had them all gathered in an underground facility where they experimented on them and eventually gave them immortality. It was a horrible, terrible plan to make sure everyone was happy. Then one girl suddenly died in the center of the plot. The only one left alive was a man named John Smeaton.
