What is the lie?

I'm currently writing this story for my school project. It's a very basic story about a woman and a man falling in love. Her sister helps her by seducing the man while he is sleeping. I know he really shouldn't do it, but he was drunk at the time. And, after the whole thing happens, she finds out about it.
When I read this kind of story in books or in movies, the characters always tell a lie. Like, instead of saying that she doesn't cheat at the time of their relationship, the man would say that they cheated in the past and they want to stop. But I can't do that because I think it's a lie.
My question is should I write a normal story like my current story, tell a lie, and then explain that he is lying? Or are there any other ways to tell this story without having a lie?

A:

Yes, we are not sure what the lie is.  It's not important what the lie is.
The purpose of the story is to build character. The character tells a lie in a way that is most believable to the audience. The audience can infer what the lie is from the telling. You can even have the audience infer the lie directly: The character tells a lie that is believable enough for the audience to deduce the lie that way.
So do not focus on the lie. It is enough that the character tell a lie that is believable enough for the audience.

A lie is a lie, if it's a lie at all. If he's in a bar, he says he loves his wife. That's a lie. If he's in bed and his wife has been murdered and he says so to protect the murderer, that's still a lie. He was supposed to protect her from
