The small fishing boat left the small port town just as the sun began to set. Toby, the captain of the boat, had brought along his nephew, Jake, to help with the hours-long voyage. Toby was renowned in the fishing community for his luck in these trips, often coming back from several days' journey with hefty hauls.

Tonight, however, they returned with nothing. Despite looking everywhere, the net they had brought along was completely empty. Toby, who was used to such success, was visibly perplexed and disappointed.

Jake, on the other hand, was surprisingly energetic and hopeful.

"Uncle! Maybe it's just a bad sign that we're coming back with nothing tonight. Maybe it's a sign that we're gonna find even more next time!" He said, his eyes shining as he thought of the possibility.

Toby smiled softly and patted Jake's shoulder.

"Well, we shall see, won't we?"

The two of them began preparations for the next voyage, stocking the boat with food, water and other supplies.

But the next day, Toby left the port without Jake. He had been called away unexpectedly the night before and couldn't be found.

The fishing boat returned again with nothing, and the townspeople began to whisper. Toby had never been known to take such risks on the open seas, so why was he going alone?

It wasn't long before the whispers became shouts as it became clear that Toby and Jake weren't coming back at all.

The townspeople searched the open seas for weeks, never finding anything.
 But the mystery of what happened to Toby and Jake still remains unsolved.
