Satan struggled to find the words to search his teenage son. For months, he had grown more and more restless and unruly, particularly when it came to traditional values like hard work, obedience, and discipline - all of which his father held dear. Satan had two choices - either stay silent and continue to watch his son drift away from him, or try to do something about the situation. As difficult as it was to admit it, Satan had to face the fact that he was raising a child in complete opposition to him.

Yet, despite these differences, Satan still loved his son dearly and wanted the best for him. He decided to take a more modern approach to parenting - one that was still firmly rooted in morality and values, yet was more accommodating to his son's needs. Satan would be forward thinking and open minded in order to regain his son's trust and respect.

Satan allowed his son the freedom to explore his own interests - be that peace, love, and harmony, or something else entirely. Slowly but surely Satan saw an improvement in his son's behavior. He also took the opportunity to teach his son valuable lessons about life and open his eyes to the hurt, disappointment, and pain that comes with giving into harmful habits or ideologies.

Satan eventually regained his son's trust and they both soon found a middle ground. A compromise was found between traditional values and more modern ones, allowing the two to come together, albeit not perfectly.

Satan remained grateful to have been given a second chance at parenting, and continued to raise his son to this day. He embraced the values of peace, love, and harmony and taught his son their importance. They enjoyed wonderful conversations about life and the importance of maintaining harmony and respect for others.
