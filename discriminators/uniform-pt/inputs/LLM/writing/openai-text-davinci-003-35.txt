Once upon a time, in a distant kingdom, a period of darkness and turmoil began. The hero of the kingdom was killed in battle as he attempted to save the land from the growing threat of the evil king. Despite the hero's valiant effort, the evil king remained victorious, claiming the land and all its resources as his own.

In a desperate attempt to further strengthen his hold on the kingdom, the evil king demanded a great sacrifice. The princess was chosen as the offering and gave her life in exchange for the people of the kingdom. Though the people grieved the loss of their hero and their princess, they could do nothing to stop the circumstances set in motion.

With the death of the princess, the evil king declared his dominion over the land, imposing harsh rules and cruel punishments to keep the people in line. Many of the citizens held hope for a better future, but nothing seemed to improve.

Yet, despite this seemingly bleak reality, a remarkable thing began to happen. Slowly, but surely, the tyrannical rule of the evil king began to improve the lives of the average citizen. With the strict punishments in place, crime and chaos decreased, allowing for a more lawful and organized life. The kingdom had a certain symmetry and stability, however dark the source of its creation.

Though no one was happy with the circumstances of how it came to be, the people of the kingdom agreed that overall, life had taken a turn for the better. Though the hero and princess were gone, their legacy would live on as the foundation of a bright future.
