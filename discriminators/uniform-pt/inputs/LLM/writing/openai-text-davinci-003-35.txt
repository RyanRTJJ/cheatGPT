Lauren had just moved to a new city and was bewildered by all the activity going on around her. She felt out of place and scared, not really knowing where to turn. Everywhere she looked she saw people hustling and bustling, going about their day-to-day lives.

One thing that struck her as odd was that everyone seemed to have a blinking neon sign hovering above their head. At first, Lauren thought that she was just seeing things. But then she noticed that the signs all read different numbers in varying sizes, ranging from the single digits to well into the hundreds of thousands.

It then dawned on her – the people were displaying how much money they made annually! The higher the number, the richer the person seemed. It was like walking through a showing of The Price is Right.

After some more exploration and questioning, Lauren discovered that this was a new trend called “Open Source Income.” People believed that if they were honest and upfront with the amount of money they made, it would result in a more level playing field and equitable distribution of resources. In other words, those with more money would be more likely to share and give back to the community.

Lauren found the concept fascinating and revolutionary. She also thought it was brave of people to stand up and be transparent about their finances in such an obvious way.

At that moment, she finally felt welcome and at home in this vibrant new city.
