The hero and the villain were facing off in a large stadium, surrounded by onlookers. The hero had been tasked with stopping the villain's seemingly endless stream of evil plans and schemes that had been wreaking havoc on their city.

The hero, determined to get some closure, took a deep breath and asked the villain, "why are you doing this? Why are you so evil?"

The villain looked at the hero, his face contorting into a sneer. "Why do I have to explain something so obvious?" he replied in a haughty tone. "It's quite simple. I do this because I can and because I enjoy it. Now if you'll excuse me..."

The hero was taken aback by the villain's apathetic response. He expected some grandiose explanation, some grand design or motivation as to why the villain chose to inflict all this misery upon their city. But what he heard instead was a shallow excuse that seemed to offer no real insight or justification for his actions. 

The hero shook his head and let the villain go, left with only a hollow feeling of disappointment. But still, he hoped that soon, justice would be served, and the city would have a chance to start anew.
