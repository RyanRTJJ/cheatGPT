 
 _Why did I make it seem like it wasn`t real, even though it was?_

The two answers given are:

1 • It was not realistic to make the props seem real because this is the job of the actor.

2 • The props look unrealistic, but they make it up to you.

The first answer is easy to accept. I make up things to suit myself all the time. I need to make my job easier. I need to be able to do whatever I want to. If I`m doing a play, I need to have enough props for the effect I want to create. I need to know how the people in the play will react to any props. This is how I know the play is working. I know how the actors react to whatever goes on the stage. I am also a writer, after all. The way I see it, writers play by their own rules and rules that everyone else can't seem to understand. I guess I prefer not to do things that seem like other people. I like things that are not in any of their rules. So my answer must be 2.

**A**

2 • Don't be discouraged! Acting is not about making up props. The props are merely parts of the story you are creating. The real props are you.

**Answer Explanation:** You have found a way to be what you are not without making up fake props. "Fishing" is a little like it! As a writer you are looking for inspiration. You have to be able to "find" things to write. You have to search in all kinds of interesting places until you find something to write about. You have to dig for what you need in order to give your characters the motivation and depth that they need in order to be interesting. They are not like us really. They live totally
