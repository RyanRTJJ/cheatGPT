_____________________________________ My name is Anna. I'm writing this to you because...my grades are awful. I am only on my second year of college and I really want to get my classes done because now that I have a car and a driver's license, it will be easier for me to manage my time. But since I don't take summer classes anymore, my classes only come in the fall and summer is going to be a complete nightmare, so I'm not sure how long I'm going to last. Here are the classes I'm planning to take next semester: Spanish, history, and science/math. This is all out of my control, so I couldn't just take whatever I want because no one will tell me what to do. In the same vein, this is also my decision, so I will not be swayed by someone telling me I need to take this class or that class. Now, since I'm on my second year of college, I'm pretty confident that I won't mess up too badly because of my ability as a student and the fact that I've gone to the same college for two years since I was in 1st grade. I'll need to take many more classes at this school, though, so I hope I'm able to get in as many classes as possible, and not only in my major, but in every single class. I have a lot of confidence in my abilities on the field, even though I haven't been out on the field much. I don't think I'll be able to do anything amazing, but I can help people. And I can still make more money than any other candidate. I've got a lot of money saved to buy the house I want in 2019, the car I want too and some expensive clothes for my boyfriend as well. At the moment, I'm living with my parents because my parents can't afford to live with me anymore and they don't have much to do these days, but if it's possible,
