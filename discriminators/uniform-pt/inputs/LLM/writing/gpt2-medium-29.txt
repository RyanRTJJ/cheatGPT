I started with a short story about a young girl suffering from a drug addiction. I think it was a little dark; I used dark colours, just as your teacher did. It's my favourite of her stories, but it doesn't match the images that are onscreen or the atmosphere of the world.  This is the moment you've had your mind controlling you; an addict trying desperately to get his own way in a world of the blind. The story follows the boy, who has lost his mother, and who has now lost everything.  The boy tries to control both his mother and his own thoughts – he uses various tricks like spinning the wheel to make himself forget the pain of his mother's dying and how his thoughts can control his own life. The plot is somewhat simple but it's a fascinating read.
I'm still not very good at this. I try not to tell stories that are less complex than what you might find in your favourite literature, but I'm very happy with this story because it's my favourite story. I like how there is a lot in it about grief, loss and the struggle to cope with your experience, you can feel the anger and the pain, and the world becomes a hell of a lot of joy and sorrow. The most impressive thing is that the story never tries to make you feel guilty about what you've done.  The writer could have taken the reader's perspective, that all these thoughts and feelings are part of the journey, but for the sake of the story, the writer used the reader's perspectives to create something almost mystical.  The story never tries to make you feel guilty about your actions, because it's all there is – the thoughts and feelings – but because the reader has used her own experiences
