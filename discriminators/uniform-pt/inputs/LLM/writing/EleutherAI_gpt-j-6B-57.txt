_______________________________________ You’ve never seen your daughter again, and you are writing her a letter now.

Write a letter for your daughter now. Write what you would say or do if she were with you right now. Write what you would tell her about your parents, if you could share. Tell your daughter something you would share if you could.

Write a letter right now telling your daughter about your parents. Write a letter about your parents to that same person at some point in the future. Write the letter then. Then wait up to two years. Write another letter about them from this past experience.

Write a letter in an old envelope or writing journal. If you don’t do that, write it on a piece of paper from now on—write the first part of the letter at the same time you write the last, so that you always begin with a blank page.

Write a letter to the woman you were in high school. Write a letter to the woman you were in elementary school. Write five letters.

The prompt for this one is in italics and you can write anything and everything. Write a letter to a stranger, asking them to go with you to a place you’ve never been, and they are to be your tour guide.

Or you can decide: Write about a place you’ve never been, and who you would go with to take you there. Make them your guide or your lover. Write a letter to a relative, asking them to come with you to a place you and they have never been, and tell them everything.

Write a letter, if you like, on one of the following subjects with the goal in mind that your reader will get to a different place with you than you would by studying the subject. Or do it on one you chose to write this morning.

Write a letter to your grandmother, giving her advice about one day you’ve never spoken to her. Tell her something you wish you had said
