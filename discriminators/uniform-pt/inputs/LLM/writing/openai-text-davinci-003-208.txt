It was just another night. The same routine: brush teeth, change into PJs, hop in bed and fiddle with the white noise sleep machine to find the perfect soundscape for a good night's rest.

Tonight's soundscape of choice was office-type noise. The whirring of printers and quiet conversations in the background gave the impression of a busy day at the office- perfect for an easy sleep.

After two hours of restful slumber, I was awakened by an odd sound. It was faint and muffled, like a whisper or a distant conversation. At first I thought my mind was just playing tricks on me - until I heard the sound again. Louder this time. It sounded like two people chatting, but I couldn't make out what they were saying.

What is going on here? Is this even a sleep machine? I tried to recover some kind of explanation, but I couldn't. My heart racing, I quickly turned off the noise machine and decided to never use it again. Later I realized that my sleep machine had been picking up on a conversation coming from the room next to mine- a conversation that somebody had intentionally left just loud enough for those in the right place to hear.
Taboo topics? Maybe, but that remains a mystery to this day.
