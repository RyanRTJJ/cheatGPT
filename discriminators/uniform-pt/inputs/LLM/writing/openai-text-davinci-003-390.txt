It had been almost a year since I was abducted by aliens. As far as abductions went, this one had been strangely 'civil'. I had awoken aboard a massive spacecraft, in a large and luxurious bedroom. After some poking around, I'd quickly deduced that the aliens had meant to abduct someone else—it seemed as if the whole spacecraft was bustling with activity, but some of it seemed misdirected, as if to cover for a mistake.

The aliens themselves had never been hostile, though they seemed almost afraid of me at times. Whenever I would ask questions, they would change the subject or outright avoid the question. But I knew something was off.

After about a year, I had finally surmised the truth: the aliens had mistakenly abducted me and were desperately trying to cover up their mistake. A few of the aliens had even gone so far as to ensure I was well-treated, in the hopes that I would not tell their higher-ups the truth.

But I wasn't going to let their mistake slide. I prepared to escape and contact my government, with the aliens' misdeeds in tow. Little did they know, I'd already worked out a plan—one that involved me as the mastermind who had put it all together.

It was time to show the aliens that they had picked the wrong guy.
