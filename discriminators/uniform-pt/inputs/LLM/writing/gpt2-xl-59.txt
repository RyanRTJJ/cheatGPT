-------------- A few hours into his stay in the asylum, the patient is walking from his bed to his window, and as he gets there, the man who attacked him steps out from the shadows. The man is a man with a long, blond-haired ponytail like a pig. He wears torn, dirty clothes and his face hides a scowl and a deep, painful fear. He is one of those who, in spite of their best efforts, can never quite shake the need for freedom. He knows that a life beyond the walls of this strange place that has always left him cold is still the only chance he's got.

4. Write a story based on this prompt: He said no and moved on. The patient looked the man in the eyes. "You know what I do?" He said. "I have a lot of things." "You'll never find anything when you look for it in those things," said the man in the brown suit. "And the other night I was looking for something, and my wife knocked on my room, and she said, 'You have to go outside, my husband has a heart attack.'"

5. Write a story based on this prompt: No, no, No! The patient was lying on his stomach, wrapped in an orange prison blanket, looking up into the void. There was a thin layer of fog over everything. The blanket gave way and the blanket was gone. "I want to go home." said the patient. Just then the man with the ponytail stepped out of the fog and came closer to his patient. "You're going back into that fog, like that time yesterday with a knife to your neck." "No, no. I just want to know if there is anywhere I can go." "You won't find that," said the man. The man walked away, not wanting to make another appearance in that fog. The patient was left alone with that fear for the first time in his life.
