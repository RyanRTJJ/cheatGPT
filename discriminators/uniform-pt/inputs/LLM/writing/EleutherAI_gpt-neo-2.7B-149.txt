How This Was Gonna Work](001-toc.html#chapter1)

I had a story idea that was completely out there, completely impossible! A mad-hatter's idea, to say the least. It was about time I brought out my time machine and used it as a time machine. But, of course, I would never do what I thought was wrong. I don't think I like to think about things like that sort of thing. You know the sort of thing, when you don't think you might do it. And then you do, but the fear of regret hits you like a Mack truck, you know what I mean? So I would rather stick to thinking about things like science. And math.

I guess those thoughts don't help at all when it comes to doing anything practical or something, you know what I mean? Math, physics, chemistry – you need these, especially as a writer. You need to be a bit of a connoisseur. You need to have a certain level of understanding. You know the sort of thing that I'm talking about. You've probably got the bits of the maths, you're up to the equations, you probably can do a little math about chemical reactions – that sort of thing – but you need that level of understanding if you want to write a book, a proper book. You wouldn't like doing something really practical; you wouldn't have any enthusiasm, you would be too dull to do anything practical like that.

So I'm going to use the time machine as a time machine. I won't even consider it practical before I get an idea. So now I must tell you I'd got an idea. And it would be brilliant fun!

I don't know if my mum knows I've been spending all my spare time on this? I've got this idea about
