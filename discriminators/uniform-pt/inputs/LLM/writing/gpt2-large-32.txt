Â As part of your education, you learn how to survive as a human in this new society as well as your own special skills and attributes. If you follow all of the instructions exactly, your species will be resurrected and you will be reunited with the civilization that has raised you. What do you think will happen next? I really like the idea of making a new species from our ancient DNA, but I don't think the scenario is realistic.

What are your thoughts on the idea of resurrecting the DNA of ancient humans? The DNA of humans doesn't change enough over millions of years to be of any real use. But perhaps, if we can manage to clone ancient humans, we should experiment with creating some of our DNA back on Earth and see what kind of mutations we could make. We could experiment with altering our chromosomes in the labs to give us an extra boost of longevity or make an extra pair of toes. What do you think will happen to the alien cultures that have survived and now live on Earth? Will they find a good use for the DNA? Do you think it will be useful in solving some of humanity's toughest problems in the future?
