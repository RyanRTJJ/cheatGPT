 As cheesy or 'too good to be true' as you'd want it to be, go for it. If it sounds too implausibly awesome, then you've done ok already.
Ooh, I like that. That's not too cheesy, and I like that it's very ambitious. I'll try to come up with something for you in a week or two.
No probs. If you come up with some good ideas feel free to send them my way.
Hey, I've still got the idea I was working on! It's not exactly an exact replica or anything, but it might work for your prompt.  Edit: Also, I made it short for easier readability, so we can fit it in less than a page. I'm not going to submit anything that's longer than a page.
Great. Sounds good. Let me know if you need anything else. :) Feel free to PM here or in Reddit. All the best.   Also, you could submit it to  contests in Science Fiction etc. The more the better.
Sounds good! I'll see how it flows, but it turns out that you can submit your own work to contests as well. So I may do that for next year's Christmas break.
Oh yes, I forgot about that. Good luck.
I'm thinking it might have a more of a fantasy setting, or one of the alien ships from Close Encounters than a sci fi setting, but I'll have to wait and see how it flows before I can decide.  Edit: Oh hey, my idea worked with your prompt!
I'm glad. If you have any more you come across, feel free to contact me here or on reddit, ok?
