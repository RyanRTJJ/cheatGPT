The world of immortality was a paradise, where life was lived without worry of death. The inhabitants of this world were a blissful race, content in their everlasting lives, never to feel the burden of mortality. 

But one day, something unimaginable happened. Somebody died. 

At first, the inhabitants of the world could not believe it: it had never happened before. Death was an unknown concept in this world. But the news slowly spread and the people accepted what had happened. 

They gathered around the deceased, and held a funeral for them. It was a solemn occasion, and a reminder of their own mortality. 

As the people mourned, they began to question the implications of this death. While immortality had its advantages, not being able to die could also be a curse; it could be a life without possibility, without freedom. 

The people of this world had now seen the consequences of death, and many were no longer content with the life they had. In response, they sought out knowledge that would give them the power to die on their own terms, in whatever way they chose. 

And so, the people of the world of immortality found the power of choice, and gained a newfound appreciation of life. They were no longer bound by immortality, but instead, they could decide when and how to end their lives. 

The world was changed, and the inhabitants of this world found a newfound freedom: the freedom to choose.
