It was almost exactly a decade ago to this day when Jay Gatsby first saw Daisy Buchanan. From the moment his eyes connected with hers his life changed. He had never been in love before, but the power of Daisy's presence was undeniable.

But here he was now, nowhere close to the man he had once beenâ€¦ back at the very same place he had seen Daisy for the very first time. Despite it all, he still had a dream that he and Daisy would find a way back to each other.

The sound of her laughter at the party set him in a trance as he had so often during their time together. But this time, he couldn't shake the nagging feeling that things wouldn't turn out the way he wanted. Seeing her from the window, surrounded by her friends and the glittering lights of the city was like a slap to the faces.

Gatsby knew the life he had once imagined for them was a distant dream, his dreams of being by Daisy's side forever were just that, dreams. 

He could feel his heart shattering from the realization that this was the end. He'd never have the life with Daisy he'd wanted for himself. It was no longer possible, and it was all so hard to swallow. 

He thought of all the moments and little things they'd shared. He thought of all the moments that had made his heart swell and throbbed with love; all extinguished in the wake of his realization. 

As he turned away, walking into an inescapable future, all he could think was that if he'd been given the chance to do it over, he would have never wander into Daisy's life in the first place.
