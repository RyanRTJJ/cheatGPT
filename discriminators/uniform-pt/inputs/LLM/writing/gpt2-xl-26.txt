 Share your story with me below. The story's title MUST be a title you can remember from now on. I'll then take a random sample of the stories and place them into a database, with links to their authors on the side.

I'll then compile the stories into a small anthology. The anthology will be a free download which will have three chapters that will be available to all backers.

I'll then read all of these stories, and then select four, choosing one from each chapter I read. Those four authors will then get to develop a story with their new material, then share that with the readers via a free anthology. There will not be a fixed release date, and you'll be able to read the stories as soon as they are created.

Finally, all backers will receive a free Digital Art Book of the original four chapters of the anthology. You'll also get a download link to the collection of stories from this campaign.

I will then release the books to both digital and print mediums. I'll have all the digital files made available for free to all backers at the $10 or $15 level, or at the $30 and $35 level if you'd like to upgrade your physical pledge. I will then print ten copies, at a cost of $30 each, of the anthology and give one copy to you. The other ten copies will then go to the original authors of the four chapters that you voted on.

All of us took out our phones and went to Twitter or Facebook all that night to see who else was affected by the story, and who had the best idea of what could be done to make this story feel truly alive. I was very heartbroken to see that the authors of the story had lost their father. It was in those moments that I told the
