_____________________ This was written by JT's roommate, Ryan, who's in his 20s. I'm writing here to get my first time here. _____________________ The first 100 stories I wrote in my 2 1/2 year stay in Toronto (and my third month in college) were the ones about being alone in a foreign country. _____________________ My life has become a sort of adventure-fiction-adventure-fantasy-parody.

I'm 19 years old and work as a computer programmer. _____ You can email me about stories at kathryndumont@hotmail.com. _____________________ If you were a Canadian citizen, where would you live? What is your gender and/or age? _____________________ I can hear you. What country are you from?

What kind of things do you read on Tumblr? Are there any sites where I can find Canadian news and current events?

And what do you think about all the left-wing political movements in Canada? _____________________ I think every country in the world could become a democratic state but it would take a revolution. _____________________ Why do people use the Canadian flag? _____________________ Are there any Canadian artists you follow? _____________________ Do you have friends that are from Canada? For example, a friend
