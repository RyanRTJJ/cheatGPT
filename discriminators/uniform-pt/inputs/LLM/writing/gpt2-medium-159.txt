 Now you want to discover who that is, and use that to bring about change in something.  That's what this story is about.  We're writing it for someone else.  We're doing it purely for ourselves.  We're letting anyone who has already experienced this know about it, so they don't have to, too, because we're letting them go on a journey.  In this story, you're reading from a script, and we're using it to go through all those different kinds of memories and experiences over time as a means of healing one another.
We're a small, independent group of people who love to write.  No one is demanding that we do anything, nor is everyone in a position to have any input on this, but we're trying our best to produce a work that does as well in a room full of people as it does on a paper, an app, and a tablet.  We all use different writing systems, but for whatever reason, most of us are all writing in a script.  We're not trying to tell anybody how to write.  We're trying to teach writers to write by letting them be writers themselves.  We make a set of principles that work for us today, and we try to repeat them.  Our mission is to teach our writing techniques from the same place, and help readers be confident using them through the process we're going through as a group.  We think of ourselves as something else now -- a writing school.  We know it can be scary and exciting -- scary and exciting with something that is really scary and exciting with nothing much to teach to the audience -- but we just thought we would try to be inclusive.  We don't try to teach anyone techniques.  We don't think our techniques are the only ones that are important, or essential.  Instead, we want everyone to have the same tools to be inspired by anything, but maybe not everything. We want everyone to have the same place for writing pleasure
