  My goal is to finish two or three letters this year
You can PM me if you want to talk about it :) You got this!   *And the whole world can see it's only meeeEEE*  I think we're all in similar situations. I'd love to write the letter too but I'm too much of a chicken. (Also because I'm too weak to do it myself :p)
You can PM me too! I also get anxious when it comes to writing letters!
Alright! I'll send you a PM now. Haha. I'm glad I'm not the only one :)   I hope that the things we write become something like a gift to ourselves! And it helps to be able to say them and know they're real :)
That sounds great  And I hope that too :)
The more I think about it the better it gets! Good luck! We can do this! ‚ù§Ô∏è
That's a good way to think about it! Thanks!  You too!

You're welcome and thank you also! And yes, we can do it! You got this! We got this! Together we can write a great letter!
Just what I needed to hear :D Well said. I believe in myself! You too :) You believe in me? üíñ
You too :) And me! It really helps to write things down. I hope the two of us write awesome letters :)
