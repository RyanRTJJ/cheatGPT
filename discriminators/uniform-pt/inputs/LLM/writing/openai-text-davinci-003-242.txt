Miles McKena was an aspiring sci-fi novelist from the small town of Morgantown. Although he had struggled to make a name for himself, he was determined to make the big time and be a renowned author. After months of hard work, Miles finally finished his first novel, Jurassic Pork, a cosmic-tinged story about a scientist in the year 3,000 who discovers a time-travel device and ends up in the Jurassic period with a giant porker.

Unfortunately, the novel was almost universally panned by critics. Reviewers called it a "subpar sci-fi novel" and "flat and uninspired". Miles was crestfallen, but decided to take the criticism in stride and use it as inspiration for his next novel.

So Miles set out to write a new novel, one that would be a huge success. He spent months writing and editing, creating characters that were more complex and vivid and rewriting scenes so they were more engaging and interesting. Finally, after a year of hard work, his new novel was ready for publication.

Miles was nervous but confident as the reviews of his second novel started to come in. And his confidence was rewarded; his new book was a success! Critics praised Miles for his creativity and imagination, calling it "an engaging and original sci-fi adventure". With Jurassic Pork forgotten and a successful new novel, Miles was finally able to make a name for himself in the sci-fi world.
