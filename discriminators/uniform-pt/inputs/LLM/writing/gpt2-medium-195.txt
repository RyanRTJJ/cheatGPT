~~~ I can help write it, but only if your story is in our category. Please fill out an application and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. ~~~~~~~ This is our first story and we would love your feedback. You can get us in touch with feedback, questions, comments on blog posts, or stories you want to help us tell. ~~~~~~~ I write one very funny horror and one pretty sweet comedy horror mashup (as well as a couple of romance and horror stories) for my blog, The Fade. You can find out more about me at my social media. My stories are a lot closer to the mood of the time than the characters. Feel free to comment, share, and/or leave a tip or review for The Fade. Have a great day! Thanks for reading!
