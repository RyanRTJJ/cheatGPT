 over in Bayside, London.   The song itself is fairly easy, though there was a bit of a problem with it.  This is for a  comic  by Michael Abrash  of Tor.com and I like the lyrics quite a bit.   Please take a little time and give back to him, as it helps me out a lot with my own work.   I was able to help his  comics  out by reposting a couple of them, and giving the lyrics to the song as a PDF, so you can download the free  CD /  PDF  version to play in your computer or print it off.   He  actually wrote a blog post that I posted it in as well (on the other side), so feel free to check that blog post if you want to read in full just the intro.  I just needed to make it a little more short and sweet, so I made a new comic about it.  If you like the comic, please support me, share it with your readers, and you can pick it up by simply  visiting the comic  in the link below  and supporting me via PayPal. Enjoy!
