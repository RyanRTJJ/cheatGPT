As I watched from the window of our spacecraft, the planet of my birth slowly disappeared from sight. This had been our home for generations, but now it—like the generations before me—was gone. Through the glass, I saw the resolute forces of the invaders continuing their mission of destruction, raining fire and destruction on everything that had once been beautiful and thriving.

I saw the smoke and debris fill the sky, the rivers of our people's tears running down the ravaged landscape. No one had expected this level of devastation to be inflicted upon us all so quickly and with such viciousness.

Tears of shock and sorrow streamed down my cheeks, as I said my final goodbye to the place I had called home. This was the home of my ancestors and the birthplace of my dreams. Earth had been a place of hope, of freedom and of peace. Now, I saw nothing but death and despair.

But soon we moved away, heading into the endless depths of space, seeking a space where we could start anew. We were heading off into the unknown, searching for a chance to build the world we had lost.

As I watched Earth grow further and further away, my heart was heavy, but at the same time, I felt a spark of hope for the future. Maybe someday, we would find a new place to call home and reclaim our planet from the invasion. Until then, I looked forward to the new adventure that lied ahead, no matter how uncertain it was.
