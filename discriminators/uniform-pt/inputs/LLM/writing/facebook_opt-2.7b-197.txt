 What happens?
Dying I’d assume
I think I should've said "one last time together" in the prompt. I wrote it as "the one last time I told you I love you."  But good reply.
Ah yea I see it now
I'm not the first person with that idea, so I think it needs a rewrite. It's a pretty good idea though.
Awh thanks, I really appreciate it! I’m pretty new and I’ve really loved this. But if I did write it I would edit more haha, idk if I would actually do it but I guess it’d be nice. How’s your writing?
Yeah. I know what you mean about the edit. I think it would look better with a rewrite. I'm a writer too, although I can write short stories, but I've been thinking about self publishing.
I’ve got this short-story I’m working on that’s probably my best one, but I don’t want to put it online. It’s just a little personal, and I’m not really sure how to go about promoting it
I'd hate for you to have to go through all of the trouble without a satisfying end. Maybe that's me being self-conscious, but I would definitely share it with a few other people at least to begin.  How would you promote to get around the personal problem? I used a friend's blog to promote one of my short stories so I could give it to others.
Just write it to be honest! I can see where you’re coming from. It’s just something about a personal story, and then a self-promotion, that’s the hard part if you think about it. I guess that’s why a novel is just so long, because the characters make it so real.. the way I see it, it’s a challenge lol
I actually started my novel (about 6 pages in now) and then realized I needed the story more about the world and less about myself. My main character is a really cool,
