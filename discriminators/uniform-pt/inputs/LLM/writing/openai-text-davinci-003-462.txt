Aaron had been a dictionary writer for 10 years, and he was extremely proud of his work. But lately, he had been finding it difficult to concentrate on his work, and it was starting to show in the examples he chose for each definition.

An archaic definition of "turbulent" might have given, in Aaron's hands, a sentence that read "The turbulent man raged in his lonely despair". A definition of "resilience" might have been accompanied by "It was a long, hard struggle to find resilience within her fractured soul". 

It was becoming increasingly clear to Aaron's co-workers that he was struggling with personal problems, and he could no longer keep them apart from his chosen examples. He was angry with himself, feeling like he was failing as a professional writer, but he was also deeply depressed and had a hard time seeing the positive in this situation.

He eventually sought counseling, and when his mind began to clear, he realized that he was now better equipped to choose examples from a personal place, a place where he could pull from his own experience and create stories that would help others relate to the words. 

He became more conscientious about his work, now blending the objectivity of a dictionary entry with the emotional emotional depth of his own personal struggles. He was proud of his work, and it showed, as his colleagues praised him for his newfound creativity.
