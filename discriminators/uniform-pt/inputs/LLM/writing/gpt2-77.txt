______________________________________________________________________________ We've been informed that after a period of time, Google has decided not to honor the terms of its "Unacceptable Behavior policy." _______________________________________________ Google's official statement, the "Unacceptable Behavior Policy," reads like this: "Google has a policy," says the statement at its new logo, "To ensure that our policies are consistent with other Google products, Google has adopted policies that may potentially violate those of other companies. These policies, which may have negative or discriminatory consequences for these companies, are the sole means by which the Google-owned products, services, APIs, services developed by Google or other partners, and their software may be used to harass, abuse, harm, or coerce others at a company in which Google operates." This new policy, which was recently put together by an organization called "The Global Coalition Against Sexual Assault on the Web," apparently includes nothing new about this incident, instead calling on Google to honor and implement "the principles of privacy, security and tolerance, a universal goal that requires all individuals to recognize and respect women and all women's rights advocates, organizations, and individuals." _________________________________________ If you think this is a bad thing, think again. If you think this is a bad thing, think again the entire site (plus one of the most notorious fake news sites in the whole world) has to be deleted from your website (the one with the worst quality and most malicious content). _______________________________________________________________________________ It's one thing for Yahoo to go down one time. It's another thing for Google to go down once again. ________________________________________/
