  
For those of you in a rush, here are some notes on word use in this story:   
When you use the word 'once', you're using it in the singular form.   
It is generally correct for you to say "The last soldier/men" as you describe the men, and you can say it in more than one way.

That said, it's perfectly acceptable to use "men" here when talking about two soldiers. If you refer to
