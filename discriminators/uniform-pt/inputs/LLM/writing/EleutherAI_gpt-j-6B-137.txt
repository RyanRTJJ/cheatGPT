The Unabomber began his journey as a mild-mannered math teacher, but ended up one of the most hated men in America. The FBI found him and his girlfriend in the basement of their apartment, where they'd had a bomb factory for years.

It sounds like a fictional television show, but on February 3, 1980, Theodore Kaczynski did indeed bomb the University of California, the University of Michigan, a company that made microwave ovens, a local post office, and the house of the local FBI agent in charge in California who was investigating him.

Kaczynski was a math professor who worked in the California college town of Greenfield, California. By his late 40's, Kaczynski had become obsessed with the idea that it was acceptable to use violence to change the world, and he did not hesitate to make the most heinous acts.



This picture was taken at Kaczynski's brother Daniel Kaczynski's house in 1995. He was never publicly accused of any acts of terrorism.

Most people are aware of his first bomb, the Unabomber, but he planted bombs and wrote essays to spread the word about white supremacy in the mid-1980s as well.

Kaczynski grew up in an orthodox Polish family. During World War II, the family was sheltered in Nazi-occupied Poland under the identity of a Polish officer. Kaczynski's older brother was in the Polish underground. His father was executed by the Nazis. Kaczynski himself had a difficult relationship with his father growing up, especially after his father's death. His family left Poland for America before he was 4 years old.

Kaczynski was a math professor by trade, teaching at many universities in the area before his teaching became his main source of income - and his real job. He
