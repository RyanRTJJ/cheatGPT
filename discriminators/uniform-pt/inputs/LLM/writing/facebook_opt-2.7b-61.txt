  It's simple enough on its face, though the details can range from unsettling to downright terrifying.
that sounds fucking awesome. I want to write stories and I'm sure everyone else wanted to read mine!
If you have a partner who wants to be in it, we'll have to see if it can be made something cool and worth being written. If you don't have one you probably won't be able to write because you'll have to go to some kind of writing workshop of some kind and spend more time in a room than writing on your own.  Or you could just write one right now and post it here. I'm sure some people will read it, if it's any good at all, and say good things about it.
>If you have a partner who wants to be in it  well I definitely don't have a partner...and I'm not sure I'd like someone to write it with me. I have some ideas, but I know there are a lot of people who have written books and things, and I don't know their writing style or what kind of things would catch their attention, or what wouldn't.
I haven't written a whole lot of fiction, and I have a hard time imagining what someone might want to read that I haven't written myself.   But if you come up with something, I'll read it.
I'll try! I don't want to write a bunch of stuff if they just won't read it...
I'd suggest reading the whole thing as you go, and then just looking up what things you want to have explained. I imagine if you're trying to make this as good as you can possibly make it, it probably helps to know what things need to be explained at each point.
yea you're probably right.
