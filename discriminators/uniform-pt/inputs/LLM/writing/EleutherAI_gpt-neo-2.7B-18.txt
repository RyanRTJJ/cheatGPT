How to Build a Time Machine

1. Pick a Star System
You need to pick the type of planet that you want to land on. It can probably be seen
by anyone scanning the Earth or other planets for life.


2. Make a Plan to Land at a Planet of a Certain Type
There are a limited number of planets with the right conditions, and we don’t want to
land on any of them. In order to figure out what those conditions are, you need to build
a time machine.

Start a list of the planets, and the times on any planets that it is possible to go to
before you arrive. Every planet has its own time, unless there is a time machine built
into the planet itself. You can see what times are impossible to get to through this
method, by looking at how long it would take to build the time machine on a planet
before you arrive. These are the times when it is possible to choose not to build a
time machine. For example, you can pick something like a ship that you can travel to
in six hours, but it will be impossible to arrive at the time that everyone else
would have arrived. It would be more logical if you have a time machine, and it will
still be possible to arrive at that time. You already know the time, you just don’t
know how to get there.

To figure out what your times are, you can read the time of a star system in your own
time. However, stars may disappear or even change position as the rest of the universe
moves. You can read the time of a star system in your own
