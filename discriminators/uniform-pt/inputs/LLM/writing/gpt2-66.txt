 You will be forgotten.  Your memories will fade out like a shadow forever.  Then you will be resurrected.  And so... When it comes to the present, the future for your future children?  This simple question is a question for a world that loves you more than anything else, a world you want to know what your future partner is going to be like.  You want to know about how your future relationship will go when you reach adulthood.  Would you make it this year? Of course not.  As long as you remember everything about them and that's the only thing you care about, what does that call to you? Would that mean you'll be a good parent?  No, it won't.  You won't be an ideal parent.  The answers to all these questions will help you avoid the same questions you are confronted with today. The next time you talk to your future partner, you will ask those questions: "What would you do if he were to try and kill you?" "Was there time to call for an ambulance in the morning or something?" "Why would my dog go through so much pain and suffering if not for the way he handled the moment he had fallen into the water?" Or what about the time the dog was sleeping in your living room? "Why did he let you touch his leg? How would he treat you if you touched him too late?" These are all questions that may not surprise you. A better answer will be "Well, what if he hadn't done that?" Because for many times the person who is right is the one who makes our problems worse, not the other way round.  We remember and we're going to continue to remember. I love what I do and what I did for dogs and I love
