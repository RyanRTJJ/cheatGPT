The night was darker than usual outside, a blanket of nothingness lay across the vast plane of existence, no glimmers of light from stars. Even the moon was hidden from view, not appearing from the clouds. 

The small town was dimly lit, an eerie sense of dread filling the air. No one was out this night, every single inhabitant of this place knowing well to stay indoors when no stars gave light.

Folk tales and stories told of bad omens when there were no stars, tales of something or someone watching the night, a figure of myth and legend that no one ever dared to speak of. Bogeymen, they said, and monsters that skulked the alleys. 

Timothy, a brave yet stupid soul, decided he defile the trust of this unspoken warning and left his house. As he walked towards the town square his earlier courage was replaced with fear, every shadow seemed to follow him, lessening his already little light he was provided with. 

Just as he reached the center of the town his heart raced, he felt a presence of some sort, something was watching him. He couldn't breathe, he couldn't move, the figure seemed to come out of the shadows, a dark cloaked figure with no face. Timothy started running, his forced his feet to keep going until he reached his front door, entered and locked it behind him, shutting out the figure in the dark and the cryptic message it gave him: 

"There's still hope, even when no star gives light". 

Timothy was now more convinced than ever, tales of monsters in the night were most certainly true. He would never try to defy these warnings again.
