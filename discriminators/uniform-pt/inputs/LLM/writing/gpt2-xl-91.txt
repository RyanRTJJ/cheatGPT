There, on the ground, on your wrist, is a strange black stone bearing runes in strange languages. You realize the stone is a horoscope. It tells you what your future will bring. What has come to be known as the 'Great Disaster'. You must survive and return to civilization. You must also discover if the future was changed by these events. If you are able to do so, the future could be altered for good. And what has happened on your island in the past may just have changed the fate of this city.

In a few weeks, you will be able to read Chapter 3. It focuses on the Great Disaster and ends with a 'coming out' moment! We have several other stories lined up for Chapter 3 and we will have more updates to share over the next few months. Thank you so much for sticking with us. We couldn't have done it without you and your support. We want to thank one of the last three people to volunteer for this book club...our dear friend and comrade, J. J
