*********************** *********************** What did you do wrong?  You were accused and convicted of committing a crime you did not commit.  How do you feel about this?  How would the rest of your life have turned out if everything you said during a police interrogation was true?  What should you have done?  Where would you be now?  What did you know?  What did you think?  How would that change your life?  In a minute, you can answer these questions and tell your story.  Don't waste a minute in self-doubt.  Be prepared to make a decision.  If you don't do so already, how will it effect you in your future?  Don't stop until you come to an answer to this question.  Use this prompt as you think about your life.  Think about what would have happened to you if you went to trial and was found guilty on the charges.  Use the questions as well as you think about what might happen to you.  Think about how well you do under stress and use that as an example of how well you would do under normal, everyday circumstance.
The goal of the prompt is to get you to think about what would happen to you if the events that took place last time that you were accused of were true.  Make sure you are able to think of a scenario that would have happened to you if those events had unfolded like they did last time. 
The prompt will continue to ask questions that will make your mind think and make you realize that the reality of what you say or do to others or your self might result in them being made aware of those things.
The key to the prompt is to find your words, keep your thoughts in the back of your mind, but constantly question and doubt things--the way you feel--in an attempt to come to a conclusion on how your actions could affect others.
Use the words the prompt asks for while thinking
