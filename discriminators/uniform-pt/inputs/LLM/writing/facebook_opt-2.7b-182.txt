 And write a story about how this decision has affected a single person's life. Like a story where your reader gets to know their character more.
Yes, I think you should definitely write that.  Your story would be much more effective if you had the reader thinking more about your main character's motivations and feelings than about the alien lifeforms that are actually the central conflict.  Also, I like your use of "a singular life," which may lead your reader to wonder what sort of person could survive that sacrifice.
Thank you, kind stranger! Your advice made me realize that maybe my story does need more depth if I'm going for 'good'!
No problem!  I just wanted to point out that I didn't think the question "How would you feel if you were in the alien's head?"  was sufficient.  I think that you might want to expand beyond that question.
Yea, I was just curious for context but I think you're right.
Sorry about that! But glad that I was able to help you.  Keep writing. :D
No worries! Thank you again :D
Good luck and keep writing!
Wow, good advice coming from someone who can just write stories. Kudos!  Thank you for all your help! *crawls under rock*
Kudos = good. You're welcome. I don't normally post comments, but I wanted to say goodbye because I don't think I'll see this. XD You're very welcome.
Aww, I see xD It's okay. And I get that but, it's the internet so you have the advantage of getting back to me very quickly lol :D I'll send my goodbyes and thankss.
Ahh, yes, and it's good to see you again! I'll be around here a bit but I'm out for the next few months studying abroad, so I won't be as active here.
