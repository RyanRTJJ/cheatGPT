The words of this prompt are "beginning to suspect that it doesnâ€™t end." I believe you could use some of them in your own story, to create a sense of tension. For example...

"I'm beginning to suspect that it doesn't end."
"He couldn't end the journey because it didn't end."
"I'm beginning to suspect that life never ends."

A:

The idea of life never ending is a bit of a trope. Most stories with this idea are about either a child or an alien on earth who encounters humans. But, it's still an idea that you can play with. So - here are some examples of short stories that feature the idea, from what I can find - the stories don't all have to be from a child perspective.
The Journey by Joe Dunthorne starts with the protagonist noticing that it doesn't end. Or, at least, ends only after a long period of time.
In The Girl with Glass Eyes by Ctein the narrator's companion ends up dead the day his journey to find her ends.
Life Never Ends in An Unnatural Disaster starts with the protagonist's realization that there's no end to some horrific disaster.
The Earth's Last Dream ends with us reading that the protagonist, who's never been awake, realizes that there hasn't been any change for some long period of time.
And, last but not least, in When The Day's Gone, the protagonist is stuck, just as the world is ending, to realize that the end will never happen and everything will continue as it has.
Of course, being able to tell a good story is a lot more than just following someone else's rules. So, while not every story with this theme works, try thinking of how many of the rules you can apply, if any.
