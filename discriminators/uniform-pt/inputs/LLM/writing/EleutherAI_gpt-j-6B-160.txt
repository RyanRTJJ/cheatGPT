Now, I know I could do that in a million ways; but here's a good one: In a world filled with superheroes, you're the only one who doesn't have any powers. That's because everyone else has some sort of supernatural ability: 

Superstrength
Flight
Super-hearing
Tounges (or telepathy)
Some other secret ability (like being able to read people's minds or time-travel)

But, instead, you just have "regular" powers:

You're extremely paranoid about getting attacked. (For example, you carry a can of insect spray with you at all times.)
You're really clumsy, and you trip over everything.
You've been doing gymnastics since you were a kid, so you're able to do a cartwheel in the air and turn a double somersault on the ground.
You're really smart, and it comes in handy when you have to decipher "codes" in documents, like when you accidentally find your boss's private key or the password you're supposed to remember.
You get a really good feeling in your stomach whenever someone's about to betray you.
Your superpower is luck. Whenever you talk to people in high-stress situations, you never seem to make any mistakes. No one could ever catch you in a lie. No one could ever catch you saying something the opposite of what you're really thinking.

So, in this world... What does your superpower enable you to do?

A:

I'm pretty sure I have a superpower for every major character in our day. 
It's also fun to use things like "What am I missing out on?" because there will always be a "but then what would I be good at" response. 

What am I not missing out on?...I could just read minds.

I'd assume anyone in a position of power and authority or influence would want to prevent you from having this. So your superpower must also include a mind shield.
