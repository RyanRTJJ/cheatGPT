Sherri felt like she had been walking in circles her entire life. For years she had felt stuck in a job she disliked, in a marriage she wasnâ€™t satisfied with and in a life that seemed to go nowhere.

Then something unexpected happened. She found a new job, this one was something that excited her and was in a field that she loved.

After a few months in her new job, Sherri started to feel like she was getting her life back on track. She finally felt like she was moving in the right direction with the new changes she had made.

Sherri started to take the time to make her marriage a priority again. She and her husband started to go out on dates and she made sure to be present in the relationship. With each passing day, things seemed to be getting better and better.

One night as they were walking, Sherri suddenly stopped. She looked up and for the first time realized that she was back in the same place she had started walking many years before. She had made a full circle.

She turned to her husband, beaming with a newfound sense of hope. They continued walking, now with a purpose and a renewed appreciation for life. Sherri knew that whatever lay ahead will be worth it.
