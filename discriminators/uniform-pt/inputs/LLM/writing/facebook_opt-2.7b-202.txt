  Can you find some way to link the two stories together to get at some of their shared principles? (Including future conflicts, relationships, etc.)  Then write a story that's a mashup of the two stories, and have *both* stories be part of the same story.
Excellent idea. I may have to steal this for later. Thanks!
That's all I'm trying to do. You're welcome.    And feel free to check back every so often for updates. I like to hear responses to prompts about time-travel or travel history in general!  :)
Will post mine on here at some point, but not for a little bit. I think I have to write before I think. I've got too many big picture ideas swirling around in my head. The time travel thing will just have to go. I can't wait to see where your prompt takes me if you go in such a way. Do you have any tips on time travel? Or any specific prompts?
No, not really. I tend to just create a bunch of prompts I can combine into stories, and then I just have to write the ones that connect, or find my own way to do so.  Not the end of the world.
I'll take your advice. I'll write some prompts for you sometime soon. We'll see how it goes then. Thanks for all the help.   Edit: Spelling.   I love it how most people seem to really get your prompt. I wish I wrote it better! :P
And again! And again! And again! It's the only way we can both get good at this! And if not, I'm sure I'll have to do one on my own some day!   Thanks for the input. I'm also trying to develop some methods of creating and sharing flash fiction prompts that help people with their story-writing. It's hard to teach everyone at the same time, so it might be a while :/
That's fine. I'm happy it was
