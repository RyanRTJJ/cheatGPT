~~~ A group of scientists believe they have identified the culprit: dark matter — the mysterious substance that most of the universe is made of. But as with any theory, it's only considered as a good one if it can explain all the evidence. Unfortunately for the scientists however, once they try to explain everything away, what do you do with the bits of evidence that can't be explained?

The answer to that — the answer to everything — is you pretend. You invent a new explanation. You say you can only observe half of the truth. You say that you're only an animal in a giant science experiment. And you just roll with it.

How can you explain the universe if everything you've ever found is wrong? That's all the answers to this prompt, and it's a lot.
