 Then one afternoon when no one was paying attention I ran off to school. I met a boy and fell in love with him.
Okay....  *He's sitting in his chair looking at his notebook when he hears the pounding on the door.*  He's here!  *The door was suddenly thrown open; he could hear some shuffling inside.*
Zach!  OOC: Hi OP and anyone else!
*He grins and comes to the door, slowly opening it. He sees your face*  Hello, my friend. When have we seen each other before?
Hmmm, I'm not sure. I know there was someone else there who you really seemed to like, and my name was Zach.
Oh yeah, I think I know that face. Zach...  *After a moment, he nods to the other young man*  I'm Jack, by the way.
Nice to meet you Jack. Zach told me your brother is a complete ass.
That is a bit harsh, sir. I'm just doing my duty of saving the world and helping young souls cross over to...  *He pauses as the memories flash back of another time*  I think this happened once before, yes. I met a girl named Lily, and we traveled to a different world... one long time ago.
Yeah, I met her too. I remember that, and I remember the feeling of being with her for a long time.
I just wish that it was more than a memory. You have my heart, Zach... but it can't be what it used to be. That's all I really can say for now.
What do you mean she can't be what it once was?
I'm the one who changed. Zach and all his brothers are still the same people, but I became this person that has no soul, that has no heart, that is cold to the very core.
Is this an actual problem? You can change yourself. You aren't a soul, just go with it, be you.
