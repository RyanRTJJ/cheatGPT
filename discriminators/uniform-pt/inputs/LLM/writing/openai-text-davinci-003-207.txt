My dearest [Name],

It has been months since I last wrote to you, and though I’m not sure if you will ever receive this letter, writing it nevertheless gives me joy. I must admit that I never really found the courage to tell you how I feel, so here I am finally trying to put words to my feelings that I had kept suppressed all this while. 

I will never forget how I felt the moment I first saw you. In that moment, my life changed. You had unknowingly taken over my heart and my thoughts and my life. I wanted so badly to tell you, but I was too scared of the consequences and what you might think of me. I was so afraid to come across as too awkward or desperate and so I kept my feelings locked away for so long. I could never find the courage to say anything, but I always wanted you to know that I have always been there for you. In the end, I can only hope that you know the depths of my admiration for you.

It’s times like these that I regret never telling you how I felt. I hope it’s not too late, and I can only hope that you are still open to receive my feelings with love.

Your ever faithful,
[Your Name]
