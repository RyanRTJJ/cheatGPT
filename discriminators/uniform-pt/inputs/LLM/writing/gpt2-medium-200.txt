 in one of my favorite titles from around the internet to date:  The Darkest Dungeon, by Ryan Britton. (As of February 2015, this project has over 400 backers.)  I would still love to put this together, but I've been on a real tight schedule!  I've done a few projects over the years  that we'll see a new author write a few times a year. At this point, I'm trying to avoid things with names or characters that are associated with the game. These stories won't necessarily be based on something, but they won't be written in a similar fashion to any other of my projects, either.
If you want this project to get started, this is the place I would ask for your help. Here are links to websites that I have used to get the word out. I know that sometimes things aren't as easy as they seem, but I've definitely done some pretty big things in a short time and that makes me feel good about my willingness to work hard for you. There are some people out there that will love it if I start writing these stories if and when I hit the Kickstarter goal. I've been really lucky that the things that I've created so far have really resonated with people, so if it hasn't, please be willing to look into it.  Thanks so much in advance for reading!
