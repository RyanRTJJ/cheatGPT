Kira had known Davion for what felt like a lifetime. They had first met a few years ago, after he had been discovered wandering the streets. It was clear that he had no recollection of who he was or where he had come from. It had been a mystery how old he was and where he had been before. 

Kira had taken him in, as if he were her own and had promised to take care of him. She never asked any questions and merely accepted him for who he was. But what no one knew was that Davion had been gifted a strange blessing, for he was eternally youthful. He never aged or had to worry about any physical infirmities.

The problem, however, was that he suffered from a memory limit. Every second he lived, Davion forget more and more about himself and his past. Nonetheless, Kira loved Davion deeply and without question.

She found herself educating him on who he used to be, what he used to do and the memories they had created together. She would spend most days recounting stories to him in order to help him to be able to recognize her as his own. 

It was heartbreaking for Kira to see this happen and to watch as Davion slowly lost himself more and more over time. But she remained ever faithful and continued to love him selflessly and deeply. 

Even though their relationship was difficult, she was deeply thankful for the moments she was able to spend with Davion, for it was the only way for her to keep him alive in her heart and her memory.
