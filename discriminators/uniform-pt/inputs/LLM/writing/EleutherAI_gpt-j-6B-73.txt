 We live in the middle of a crisis on Earth where people are still trying to discover their true purpose on existence. You are an astronaut who has just discovered a way to move an atom to another planet and has received instructions from a special computer in space to find out where this planet should be. You've only got time to go to one planet, you just don't know which. So, you'll make a list of people whom you have known, and try to find a similarity between each and the planet you have chosen to teleport to.

It's pretty cool. Like a normal door, with no handles, only a number of letters above it.

Here's what I know about Doors.  

 The first door is Door One, and is usually opened by a key, or a combination of keys, that you must find and turn.  

The next door is Door Two, and it always leads to knowledge. But sometimes it turns out that Door Two is not a normal door, like those in real-world houses, but a portal to another dimension called heaven, hell or something like that.  

The last door is Door Three
