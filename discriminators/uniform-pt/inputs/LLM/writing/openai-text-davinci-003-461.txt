The news of the world's immortality sent shock-waves through humanity, sending an elated excitement through the streets. It meant a limitless life of knowledge and growth, a future far from death and pain. 

Everyone was pleased- everyone, that is, except for one. This person was of no quantum importance, yet still it was an oddity; one person on the planet was not blessed with this eternal life. 

The person- an avid reader, a singer, and a thinker - tried to carry on like normal, but couldn't help but feel isolated from the world around her. Every day she envied the freedom and joy of everyone else. 

One day, the person stumbled upon a large stone. Etched into its surface were the words, ‘Everything passes, including immortality’. She was confused, what did this mean? As she pondered it, she was suddenly dawned with an understanding that the world was not meant to be immortal. 

She accepted her mortality and began to understand her role in the life of this world. In some ways, her death and the absorption of her life experience into eternity, gave meaning and purpose to the world she lived in. 

The eternal life had to be balanced, and she, as the only one with mortality, was the balance. She made the most of her limitless life, living it earnestly and gratefully. In the end, her death was the greatest gift she ever gave to the universe.
