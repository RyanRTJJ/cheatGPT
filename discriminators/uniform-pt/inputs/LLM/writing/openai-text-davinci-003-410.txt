Today was an extraordinary day. I ventured deep into the woods and after a long search I stumbled upon a remarkable find; fire! I am still in shock. I waved my hands around the flames, but they donâ€™t seem to react to my movement in any way. I was so in awe of this discovery, I stayed with the fire until late into the night, just admiring it.

I have been practicing more with fire and have become quite proficient at using it. I lit a fire in a cave and cooked some of the meat I had caught. It was quite delicious! I kept the fire going, and slept beside it, it was so warm and comforting.

I realized today that I can use the fire, not just for cooking, but for providing light to see in the darkness of night. I can also use it to help protect me from animals during my travels. I am becoming more and more adept in creating and maintaining fire.

I told the other members of my tribe about my discovery and how wonderful fire is. To my surprise and delight, they were all just as amazed as I was. The elders of the tribe gave me permission to teach them how to create and use fire. I am so proud to share my knowledge with others and to see how this discovery has changed our lives.
