This is a bit different from your story, which has no dialogue and a lot of unnecessary details. The idea is that each line in the story should have something in common with one of the lines it "leaks" from.  
To help you, let's use a different but complementary exercise to explore the concept of story. I'll provide the details, but you must work them out on your own if this is the way you learn to write.
Here is the exercise: I am going to take a line from the beginning of this piece and turn it into a lie: My sister, whose husband died when she was a childâ€”had wanted to lie about that. And I knew she would have lied. 
I am going to take a line from the end of this piece and turn it into a truth.  This is a story, and the fifth sentence of this story is, in fact, what I am describing as a lie. Now, where was I going? Oh yes, we're going to move on. It is not necessary that the first and last lines of a story be the same thing (if your story is to be told well, which it is, then these sentences must all have a common theme. So, for example, the first line of your story, "This is not a fairy tale," is entirely up to you). So, if you decide that the first line may or may not be a lie, then you need a method to "decide" what is a truth or a lie and what is part of your story. 
This is where we have our first false start. Here's the first line we have chosen: What are you implying? is an indirect question which we can take as a lie because we have said we are only going to use the first line as a lie.
Next, let's take the second line. Let's put it into our story: Where do you
