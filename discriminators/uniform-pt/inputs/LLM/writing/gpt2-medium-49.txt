************ ******* If you're not 100% done with the story, I recommend you skip the "The World's Best Hitman" prompt and head straight into "The World's Best Killers" prompt. ******************* NOTE: You will find all the hints on these prompts on my TASVideos page: ( http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKVV3F5ZK3Y0Yb5bv3f8nMxM... ) ******* I'm sorry if I made you wait! I wrote this game over a year ago, and I'll continue to add things to make it better. Any additions I make are more likely to affect your playthrough of the game than the first game. My biggest goal in this game is to teach you things about writing story based on simple prompts. Please read through and tell me if things aren't clear enough or if they don't jive with your overall goal for the game. If you've made it this far in a TAS, congratulations! ******* I want to know! I also want to know what you like best about this game and what you do wrong. If you are a fan of other TAS titles, be sure to add your input to help improve this game. If you have input, you can also leave it in the comments and I'll do my best to use it here. This TAS uses the "Championship Level" from Kage Rider and includes a special move called Death's Door.
