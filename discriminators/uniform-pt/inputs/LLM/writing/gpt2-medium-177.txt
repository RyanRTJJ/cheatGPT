 Create the title sequence, beginning your script while writing the first person summary: Start with characters and titles of your characters. If you're writing a book, use this sentence: "How should I describe this character? The story would begin: "And yet...the city remained"... and ends when some child was sent away from his family." Then, write: "With this conclusion, I write a book for ages."  Then, create the first sentence: "And yet, the city remained."  For the second sentence, use the phrase "And yet, the city remained", which is short and to the point. Create the title sequence for the story for ages 2 through 7: Begin writing your title sequence with characters and titles of your characters. Repeat this step for both ages 2 and 7. Assemble the main character section and the other parts of the main section which make up your section: Begin writing your main character section with characters and titles: For the first sentence on the page, use the phrase "It's a city! It's a city... city."  Then, build paragraphs to the characters and make them coherent as you write.  And write each paragraph, then move on to the next. Make sure each section starts with "That's a city!" (note this was the easiest part!). Then, repeat this step until you've produced a chapter of your story called a book story.  You'll see the title sequence and each paragraph built out as you fill in these sections. Then, write each paragraph as a summary for each of these sections, and each summary then moves on to the next paragraph. Make sure each section starts with "That's a city!" (note this was the easiest part!). Then, build paragraphs to the cities, characters, and paragraphs. Then, for the first section, make sure each paragraph ends with the quote.  Then write it as a conclusion for the chapter. This step is optional because it's optional to write a scene at the end of your story.  Don't waste your time and energy having a scene every three days. Keep the main character
