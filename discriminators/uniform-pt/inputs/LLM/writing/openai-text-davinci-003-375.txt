Sophie had an extraordinary ability. Everywhere she walked, flowers grew in her footsteps. It was a beautiful sight to behold, as the vibrant colors of purple, yellow, red, and blue followed Sophie in her journey. But everytime she walked, her enemies were also aware of her location. 

A particular man had taken after Sophie, determined to find her and capture her. When he stepped foot on the ground, a trail of fire followed, burning away the blooming flowers that Sophie had left behind. She couldn't stand the destruction that her pursuer left behind. She ran faster, hoping to outrun him, and keep her patch of colorful paradise.

But little did she know that the man had a secret plan to overtake her. Every night, he would charm her with his poetic words, begging her to stay in one spot and make a home there. As time went on, Sophie began to feel like maybe it wasn't so bad to be with him. 

Eventually, she yielded and decided to stay with the man. Everywhere they stepped, petals of fire followed, extinguishing the colors that Sophie had brought. Any beautiful moments she had managed to create were gone, just ashes with the wind. 

Sophie was heartbroken, but refused to show it. Instead, she hardened her heart and pretended that she didn't care about what had happened - it was too late now. She never knew that things could turn out this way, but eventually she grew to accept it. 

From then on, flowers grew where Sophie walked, but burned away in the footsteps of him who followed.
