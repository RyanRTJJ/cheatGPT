I didn't really care for this particular party. I thought it was a good idea, but with my "faulty" sense of humor I couldn't see that this was actually a bad idea. This is a very personal story, and I had some things I wanted to share with you guys that I wanted to share with people who I knew would not necessarily read me the book I wrote about the night I met my friend. Also, if you guys haven't ever read my stories before, I would love for you to try out my first game, "Noise Pollution" [[[ Why did I write this book. You can find my other games on my blog at http://lizzielindshade.tumblr.com/ and on [my official site](http://lizzielindshade.tumblr.com/)]. I was thinking of writing some games I hadn't done a game before because I don't feel like putting them out there is a good use of my resources. It just so happens that I have an interesting experience to share about the night I met my boyfriend and I just wanted to start by telling it.
