Dear Diary,

Today was no different than every other day in my life. I wake up, feeling horrified and uncomfortable in my own skin. Living in a home with emotional and mental abuse, I am filled with dread before I even rise from my bed. Nonetheless, I force myself to face the day.

I wander around my home as my abuser berates me, calling me all sorts of names that I have heard a million times before. I can't escape the verbal abuse and insults, and it feels like nothing will ever change. Even when I try to stand up for myself, it always seems pointless.

It's worse when the physical abuse comes into play. There's no talking back then, I just have to take the hits and the tears. I attempt to hide the bruises, but with each new mark, I know that this life is hopeless.

I know I should be grateful for my life, but I feel so empty and disconnected from the bright and wonderful world out there. It almost feels like I'm stuck here in this dark and depressing world forever, and what's worse is that no one would believe that this was happening if I told anyone. I'm sure I'll just continue to stay quiet and move through life the same way I do now and I will never be free.

Sincerely,

A Broken Soul
