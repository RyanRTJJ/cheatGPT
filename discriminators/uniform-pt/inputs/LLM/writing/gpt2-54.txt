 (or maybe you don't want to be in the loop for that matter) How do you know if your friend died from being a meteor or just a meteor?
How do you know whether the meteor is a meteor or not?  (or maybe neither one is) That is all you know.
What happens if you want a story involving the story of a meteor?  (or not)? You'll get a hint.  (or maybe that was an error?) If the meteor moves away from the Earth and the viewer sees something that makes the meteor appear to change shape, the reader's imagination can be told by what's happened.  (Or by seeing the whole moon) How can they know, knowing only at the distance and in this case at the direction they are going? When the viewer sees something moving at the speed of light, is it a meteor?  (or maybe the moon's shadow just happens to be in the same region that the viewer had a guess?!) (If not then what does that mean if the meteor is moving around and you can't see it)? What if you want to know if something is real?
How can you know if the meteor has actually arrived before the viewer gets to them?
Why does the viewer see that something has even been approaching its destination and not just a meteor?
What does a meteor look like?  (or perhaps a meteor is bigger than you think it is?!) What is the distance that the story will take? What else could you ask for? So you know what else you like, not too far away and what doesn't get lost. What is the best way to get a quick read on a meteor?
This story is my second attempt at writing a more concise story about an incident and why it matters.
