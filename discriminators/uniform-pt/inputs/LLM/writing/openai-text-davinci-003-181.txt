When the streets of Agraba first filled with citizens in awe of the mysterious new prince, I was filled with confusion and curiosity. After all, I was an attendant who had been wished into existence by the man I came to discover was named Aladdin. 

It was all part of his plan to impress the beautiful woman who had captured his heart, Jasmine. As I watched the parade and fanfare, my confusion swirled until I was overwhelmed. What was my purpose in this new world? Who was I supposed to be?

As the parade continued on, my confusion left me and I realized what power Aladdin had given me - the power to choose who I wanted to be. But, if I allowed myself to choose, then it meant I could also change. That thought brought me a moment of clarity, but also fear. Change was part of life, but it could be overwhelming when you don't know what to expect. 

So, as I took to the streets with the others, I began to have an existential crisis. Would I ever find my place in this new world? Who was I, really?

As I reached the end of the parade, my fears and thoughts were silenced as I saw Jasmine's face. For a moment, I was fixated and in awe of the beauty and grace she exuded. In that moment, I knew that no matter who I chose to become and no matter where this journey led me, I was sure of one thing: I wanted to be the kind of person who could capture the admiration of someone like Jasmine.
