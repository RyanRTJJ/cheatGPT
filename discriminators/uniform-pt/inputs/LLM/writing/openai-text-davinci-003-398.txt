Tommy slashed his pen across the page, letting out a loud sigh as he did. He’d been working as a dictionary writer for the past five years and he was still struggling to make his mark in the world. There were so many words that he had yet to define, but no matter how much he worked, he just couldn’t seem to make any progress.

Tommy’s personal problems had begun to seep into his work, making it difficult for him to focus. Every word he wrote felt like a direct reflection of how he was feeling, and his examples were becoming increasingly more depressing. He’d tried to stay positive, but it just seemed too hard.

Take the word “love.” Tommy’s last definition stayed like this: to feel nothing, to care for no one, to be constantly alone. He had to erase it and start again, which only made him more frustrated.

The only thing that was keeping him from giving up completely was the thought of making a Difference in some way, shape, or form. He was determined to complete this task and prove that he was worth something. For now, he was just going to take it a day at a time and hope for the best.
