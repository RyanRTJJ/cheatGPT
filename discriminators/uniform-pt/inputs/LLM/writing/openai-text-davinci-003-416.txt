One day as I was taking a stroll through the park, I was taken aback to find Death sitting alone on a bench, openly weeping. Not knowing what to do, I hesitantly approached and asked in a small voice, "Is there anything I can do to help?"

Death silently shook its head, shoulders heaving. As I took a seat next to it, I noticed a book filled with old photos clutched in its hands. I asked what the photos were, and Death explained that it was a collection of the moments that had passed in its life- the shared laughs, the intimate hugs, and the simple conversations with those it had loved and said goodbye to- memories that Death had taken with them after they had crossed over to the other side. 

Death confessed they had become overwhelmed by the magnitude of their job of tending to the lives of so many, and were beginning to feel the weight of their responsibilities. I told Death that it didn't have to bear the burden of sadness anymore, and I could see their face soften as they realized that they could share their burden with me. 

We sat together beneath the sunny sky and talked openly about life, acceptance, and loss until the rain started to pour. We said our farewells in the park, but I was lingering; I wasn't ready to leave Death yet. Death smiled at me and I saw that it was filled with a newfound strength. Flashing me a grateful look, Death turned and strode away. It seemed like although Death still had to collect souls, it had learned to accept the sadness and also share its burden with friends, like myself. I watched as Death went away, feeling grateful for our chance encounter, and the reminder of life's impermanence.
