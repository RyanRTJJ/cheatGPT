Alice and Mark had been together for two years. They had a magical relationship, always laughing, telling jokes and never taking the other for granted. But today, something was different. Alice had awoken that morning with a sinking feeling in her stomach and despite her best efforts to shake it off, it stayed with her all day.

It wasn't until the end of the day that she could bear the thought of talking to Mark about it. After dinner, they walked out in the cool night air, Alice's mind spinning with fear and uncertainty. She stopped walking, standing still in the middle of the sidewalk and looked into Mark's eyes.

"Please don't go," she said softly, her voice trembling slightly. "I know something is wrong, and I'm scared. I can't help but feel like you're trying to leave me."

Mark put his hands on Alice's shoulders and held her gently. He smiled at her, his eyes full of love. "Alice," he said, "I'm not going anywhere. You are the most important person in my life and I'm not letting you go. I promise."

Alice exhaled, letting out a deep breath that she hadn't realized she'd been holding in. She smiled back, her eyes glossy with tears. "Thank you," she said, "I love you."

Mark gave her a gentle kiss, and for a moment the uncertainty and fear melted away. They shared a moment in the moonlight, simply holding each other until it was time to go home. Everything was finally at peace.
