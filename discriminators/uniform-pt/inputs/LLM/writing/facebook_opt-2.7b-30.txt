 You aren't very good with this... you know.
That's a good thing though; no harm whatsoever.
But the person he robbed is very displeased (or so he was told by the person he robbed).  You can't get them back. All your actions have left him with a lasting (possibly irrational) hatred for you.  What would happen? Would you flee the scene? Or try to figure out how to win at this thing you've always wanted to do?
Ah, but the worst thing is that it can be done.
It *could* be done.    The thing to know is that it could have been prevented.  That is more dangerous thing than simply doing something you can.  Once you realise this, the real fun begins... when the consequences of failing are so harsh that you are hesitant to do it again.
In my experience that tends to be the case when dealing with sociopaths.
I think that's called having a conscience.
*sigh* No...it's sociopathy. They don't have a conscience.
Yeah, right. You don't think that someone who's willing to do something to another human could very well not be able to imagine how something like that *would* make them feel?
If he really thought about it there is no reason to think he wouldn't feel.  So sure, it could happen but he is probably not just going to do something to a person he knows isn't interested in having it.  It's unlikely, but it could.  The worst a person of that nature can do is just hurt you enough emotionally to make you never want to do it again.  That's not good enough.  I can't count how many times in the past I went back to my pocket.
So you'd choose to get ripped off over the feeling of being violated?
That's my point.  I didn't get ripped off.  He left with a better feeling about something than I did.  It's good because he won, but
