If a message you give a prompt would also be fine, click here to answer (this is your feedback button so that we can see how it impacts your choices, too). If an answer would differ and you have to choose, we'd love to hear your take.


* If you've opted in and received a link to a different prompt that doesn't make sense or has the same prompt as this prompt, and we're happy to try again, you can always tell us how your character responded. Just message us and we'll give you a screenshot so we can make it easier for you.

Also, if you like what I do, please give a little extra money to support our writers, so they stay on top. I don't really have a Patreon or any other kind of Patreon, but if you'd like to see if I have a website, you can check it out - if you have a PayPal account, feel free to do so so I can use it as well (more on that later).


Please check back for regular updates.
