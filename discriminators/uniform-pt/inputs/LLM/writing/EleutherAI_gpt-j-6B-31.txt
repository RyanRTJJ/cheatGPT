You have been warned. 

The first thing that is very easy to do is the first thing we like to do. We will always push the restart button. So the thing that would be very easy for everyone is the obvious one. 
But even though it is obvious, it is worth mentioning.
The most important thing to remember is that we are not sure if that is the restart button or not. We can’t know if it was the button at that time, we can only guess. So when someone is pressing C+Z, you can’t go out and try something to fix it. You don’t know it will take the user to the restart button. Because they can press C+Z and nothing will happen. Even if it was pressed on purpose.
But that said, there is also another possibility. 
We don’t know if it will take them to the reset button or the redo button. Even though that button is a big one in Windows. 
We don’t know for sure because we can’t go out and try it. We can only guess what the rest will do. There are some options. And that is the thing you should be most concerned about. 
The second thing to consider is that it can be done for one of two reasons:

One
It had an error

Or...
Two
It doesn’t work that well

If it was something weird like that, you can fix it later. But if it is something that is so bad that it doesn’t work very well, you will have to go to the next possible option
The third thing to note is when the restart is the result. It isn’t usually. 
The reboot is the restart, not the restart button. That is a very important thing to know. 
We can’t be in all scenarios here. We can either be in that scenario (that one is just a very small part though). So that means that we should be looking for the third. 
The third and final thing to consider is
