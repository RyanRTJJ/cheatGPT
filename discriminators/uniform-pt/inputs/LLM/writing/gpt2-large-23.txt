 The UK is at the bottom of the pile when it comes to war but as they start to realize they were lied to about everything else by the big boys, they begin to grow a spine and realize that we aren't the bad guys anymore.  That doesn't go over well, so the 'good guys' get involved, and so does our hero, who is now a war hero.  In the wake of the defeat, the story takes a new turn, as the world gets back to normal, and the bad guys are back on the run.  Now I'm not a big military fan, and certainly I have no idea which group has won the war, but the military has been very active in the comic for a while now and I was quite impressed by their effort to make the battle a little bit more "serious" than normal. I'd love to read more for you to help make this story even more awesome. Please feel free to share your thoughts below.  Thanks! -Zak
