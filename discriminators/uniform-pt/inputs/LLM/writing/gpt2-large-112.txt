7) If all the monsters in Hell are dead as-of-yet, that means the one in Heaven is also all but-alive:

As Hell is destroyed, the inhabitants of Heaven have been moved there, and it's said there is a special place only for those who do something truly horrible. The only person allowed to enter is Lucifer. He was only put in Hell to punish himself. As Lucifer can't escape from his prison, he plans on executing his own brother, whom he blames for his exile; however, before he does, he must make an evil deal with Hell: in exchange for his departure, Heaven is to take over the world, and be a world where no mortal can live.

In order to prepare for it, humans have assembled various groups to help them prepare: angels, demons, and humans. These groups are all trying to achieve a form of immortality â€“ their goal is to be able to go back into the void, with their souls intact, to be with God after death. The angel-led Order of Abraham believes that this will be impossible, and will be wiped out, whereas the human-led Illuminati believes that humanity has to be able to create something to replace the order. The Illuminati believes that this will happen because man has run out of time. The angels believe that humans will die, then come back to live alongside God; they believe that, one day, they will achieve something similar to the Order. This causes conflict among the opposing orders. Eventually, a great cataclysm will destroy almost the entire planet, turning most of Heaven into molten rock and destroying most of the angels. Those still alive, on the other hand, will live through this, hoping to have a chance of surviving until
