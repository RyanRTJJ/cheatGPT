"Space" by David Brin. (1984)
There is a civil war on Earth, because of the discovery that Earth is inhabited. A group of humans hide in the wilderness with advanced weaponry, including rocket launchers and atom bombs.

Earthlings have learned four critical technologies which change everything on a global scale, and it all comes apart in an afternoon.
The first is global-scale fusion. It is a process which heats hydrogen into helium, and uses the resulting energy to power machines that could provide abundant, virtually inexhaustible energy.
The second is the use of hydrogen for industrial purposes. This means that the water world finally has an energy source which doesnâ€™t pollute the atmosphere; we can begin building great cities; we have an economical power source for machines; and water is free for the taking.
The third is the use of genetic engineering. The world now has powerful tools for manipulating DNA, and a vast repository of genetic information to be altered.
Finally, there is spaceflight, which means that the next generation of spaceships can take off carrying entire cities, providing the means to expand across the Solar System. Earthlings have even found a way to live in the great void beyond the Solar System, and colonize other stars.

"Stalemate" by Michael Bishop

The human species, having long relied on space travel to build a space base in what was once the middle of nowhere, have now landed on a planet about twenty miles from the galactic center. There we've found a massive star, with planets, in the system, including an Earth-like world.
Earthlings have no idea what to think about the new arrivals, because they're still trying to figure out where they fit in interstellar society -- let alone life on Earth. For one thing, their culture is alien-touched, meaning they're an alien species as well.
