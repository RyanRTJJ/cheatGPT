  Edit a word
This... would be a great prompt, that sounds just like what I was looking for.  I would also add a twist that if we go to both parallel universes as the same character we find out that our universe has gone insane and that the other one is peaceful and the other is violent and the other is just completely fucked over.
I don't know how you'd implement that, since that would make both universes a result of the conflict between the two versions of our universe, not a result of the Quantum Event itself.  If anything similar were to happen in the story (and it's not my story, for all you know!) the same problems might just manifest differently.
Perhaps I won't go with the whole parallel universe thing.  I was just thinking, the fact that there is conflict in our universe is interesting in of itself.  Maybe the parallel universe has its own problems to fix because its version of earth isn't perfect?  (A little more plot driven... not sure I should write that but then it seemed sort of "self-insert" or a fanfic...)
Well, if the parallel universe was a consequence of our own conflict (which might be the case anyway) then the parallel universe would have been affected already.  Your paradox is just a new event that has the problem of creating two parallel universes.
Yeah maybe you're right.  I'll take it off and just put a question instead. Thanks for the help though I appreciate it.
No, just get rid of the paradox. Thats the key to this whole idea.
Gotcha! Thanks!  I just updated it, do you think the question fits it?
Nope. The problem is your premise is an inherent paradox since a paradox is a situation that would create two worlds and one of them would not be the original. You just threw that outta your window immediately and thus the answer to the question is no.
I thought in a quantum world we couldn't say if it had become one or two worlds, but that our universe was the first and the other universe could be either of the two worlds.
