I should have known better when I saw the guy walking in a slow and determined manner but I didn't. His eyes were focused and serious, despite his rather casual clothing. Something told me he was up to no good, but I didn't listen to my instincts. I should have.

My fingers were fast, a movement quicker than light, as I relieved the man of his grasp. He didn't even feel me but I had made sure that nobody else did either. My years of practice had perfected this craft of pickpocketing.

But this time, when I went to check my loot, I was utterly horrified. It was a human jawbone. The shocking discovery made me turn around in time to see the guy disappearing around a corner. I ran after him, but he had vanished into the shadows.

I felt like I was losing my mind then. Who was this guy, and why did he have a human jawbone with him? I knew I had to report this to the authorities but I didn't know what else to do. I had never been confronted with such a dark and sinister crime before.

Deep down I knew that I would never forget this eerie experience, and that I had better avoid any future pickpocketing attempts. I still haven't recovered from the shock and fear of what I discovered in someone else's pocket that day.
