It was an ordinary day until it happened. I was at my brother's basketball game, a part of my weekly ritual. I watched him make basket after basket while his team cheered him on. 

Looking around the gymnasium that day, I noticed several familiar faces in the crowd. My grandmother, my aunt and uncle, several close friends. But there was one face that I hadn't expected to see. It belonged to my brother's rival on the court: a player from the opposing team.

My brother and this other player had been vying for the MVP spot all season and it was clear that tensions between them ran high. It had never become physical but there had been heated verbal exchanges between them from time to time. 

The game continued and I watched in anticipation as the two players battled it out for the MVP spot. When the clock struck zero and the buzzer announced the end of the game, both teams shook hands, including the two foes. 

Until that moment, it never occurred to me that we are all human. We all make mistakes. Despite our differences, we still had the same goalâ€”to win. At that moment, I realized that no matter how passionate the rivalry may be, we can still stand together and accept each other's shortcomings.. That moment changed the way I looked at competition forever.
