 You could do all kinds of historical figures, places, or even events.
I will be writing an exam on this if it gets picked up. This is an absolutely crazy idea to me and if it's not approved, I will write it for myself as a hobby.  On second thought I'm just gonna stick to doing this instead of taking a real one.
If you take a real one and get it approved, I'll bet I'll remember this thread and PM you for more when I need some writing.
Alrighty, I'll reply in the future if I'm allowed. Also, what do you need from a story?
You could describe a whole bunch of your childhood in one fell swoop, for instance. That way you won't need much of my help for that.  You could also write about a time you felt most inadequate and let the reader understand the feeling. Some kinds of writing are a bit more cathartic that way.  But mostly, just write a few short stories and see what kinds of stories your readers like.
You know, I never realized how cathartic writing short stories could actually be. Perhaps I'll do some today. Thank you very much for the help!
Let me know the results!
I will do. Thank you very much for the suggestions. Now for the research.
This could be a great way to make friends, actually..
My parents said I wasn't allowed to hang around teenagers anymore, so maybe I already have.  Edit: I'll be hanging around teenagers for a while now that I'm a teenager, that is.
*sigh* If only I could have been as cool as you at your age...
I was. It was a really long time ago.
