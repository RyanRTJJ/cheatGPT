     It doesn't necessarily have have to be about dinosaurs or any other creatures that may or may not exist today.  The prompt itself is meant to spark ideas.
This is definitely something I can work with. I can definitely write that.
What about a more human story? Something that has humans? Or a world that exists in an alternate universe or something. The prompt isn't about the dinosaurs, but about the change in the planet if something happens to them or if they were to die off.
I do have this story, too. It's something along the lines of this: "The world wasn't the same without the dinosaurs, and those that did exist are now extinct and forgotten, forever lost. The dinosaurs were once known for their strength, but now their bones are broken and brittle, and are too weak to stay around. To them, all that remains are the remains of their past." The end. I like this writing style and the structure/dynamic.
That's great! Maybe a different type of story. A more personal story. Tell what it feels like to have a planet turn into a desert or a mountain. And if there is also a good story element or message.
I do also have this one. I like the idea of making it a bit more personal. A story about a family, a city, a place.
Cool. I could come up with some ideas.
I'm liking this a lot better. Really looking forward to exploring more. This has really turned into a great piece of work. So excited.
I can't wait to read it! And hope you take the advice I have given you. You are good.
Thanks a ton! I appreciate it. I'll get on it soon I swear.
I hope you do. And I hope I haven't been harsh.
I don't think so. We're all here to help one another out and to make art. In the end, that's the whole point of this subreddit.
Good. And as others have said, it's very interesting
