The morning of July 8, 2015 began like any other for the employees of both United Airlines and New York Stock Exchange. Little did they know that their day would end quite differently.

Following the usual morning routine, mechanics worked on planes, customer service agents checked in passengers, and stockbrokers traded assignments. Everything suddenly came to a grinding halt at precisely 10:15 a.m. without warning, as the computer systems of both United Airlines and the NYSE crashed simultaneously.

A shell-shocked silence filled the entire building as no one knew what was going on. It took a few moments for things to get back to normal, but it soon became clear that the outages were no coincidence.

The truth began to emerge later in the day as reports of a massive cyberattack began to make headlines. Cybersecurity professionals had detected the presence of malicious software on the computer systems of both United Airlines and the New York Stock Exchange. This had caused the simultaneous crash and remained undetected until the attack happened.

The hackers had been planning this attack for weeks, targeting these two organizations specifically. Their malicious software was designed to give them access to sensitive financial and customer data, and they had been successful in their mission.

The damage was widespread and had a significant impact on both organizations. It took days for the systems to be restored, costing United Airlines and the NYSE a huge amount of money in the process. Even after the systems were restored, the hackers had still obtained the sensitive data they had been after.

The July 8 outages at United Airlines and the New York Stock Exchange will always be remembered as the first serious cyberattack of its kind. It highlighted the vulnerability of computer systems and the serious consequences of not properly protecting them.
