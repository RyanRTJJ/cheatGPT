She had been coming to the same cafe every Thursday night, month after month and year after year. Nobody knew her name and she only spoke to the cafe worker to order her coffee. She seemed to be in a daze when she entered, taking off her shawl and hat and she always seemed the same -- eyes wide and face almost expressionless.

Her coffee order never changed, a coffee with two sugars. Even if the cafe ran out of sugar, she seemed almost relieved. She slowly sipped her coffee, her gaze a million miles away. Nobody knew what was on her mind as she stared out the window.

They were her own sort of sanctuary - the clouds from the thunder outside reminding her of rainy days and the warm lights of the cafe- and they seemed to calm her spirit. But deep within her, something was awakening, a need and a thirst that no coffee or beverage could quench.

At the end of the night, the last sip of coffee would bring the slightest excitement to her eyes and the cafe workers knew it was time for her to go. She would carefully wrap up her hat and shawl, give a gentle nod to the workers, and walk out into the night.

The look in her eyes and her unexplainable joy made it clear to all - she was a person without purpose, without excitement and without a destination, she was an addict, too preoccupied with her search for something that could never be found.
