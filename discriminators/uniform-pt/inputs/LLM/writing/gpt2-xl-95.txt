_____________________________________ I'LL DIE WITH THE GRANDFATHER - A (Fifty Shades) AU (Partially Historical) Inspired by 50 Shades of Grey. When I was a small girl I dreamed of killing my grandmother and marrying the great king. Then I woke up, and went back to sleep. Later, when I was seven, I dreamed of doing it again. After I got older as I came to realise that I enjoyed killing people, I was determined that I shouldn't be caught alive, so I started killing the people on my friends' front steps as a joke. It wasn't my intention and only served to create more tension in our household. I stopped killing people when I started college, but one day my friend and I went to her house to take some pictures. Suddenly, my friend was shot in the head. There was blood everywhere, and my friend's skull had shattered into a million pieces. She was gone. It was the first death I remember. At school, I saw a few people with odd features. The principal told me I had a big responsibility â€“ to keep things peaceful and make sure everyone kept their mouths shut. He told me that I was a danger to the rest of the students. He'd send me an email if I wanted to leave. I didn't want to leave. My family moved from the North up into Scotland and I grew up, getting to know them better, becoming close friends with them. They were nice people who loved my sisters and me dearly. They also told me they had a grandson, and so I had a grandpa, who was a kind, thoughtful and patient man, and taught me how to handle people. We're no longer in the country, but my parents still live
