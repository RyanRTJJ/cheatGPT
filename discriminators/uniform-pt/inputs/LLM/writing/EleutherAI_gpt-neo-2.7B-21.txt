Dorothy Day, a pacifist and a former lecturer at an integrated high school in Mississippi, founded a pacifist organization in 1944 that advocated non-violence; but she also promoted nonviolent behavior in other ways, including the practice of "walking. " In 1947, at a rally to protest segregated schools, she said: "The time is getting short to say that I’m out to walk the walk even on a white ground, because there is no white ground." Dorothy Day’s message of non-violence was not a new one; it was an amalgam of the pacifist and Christian moral traditions. In 1944, she stated:

We believe... that to the world which God gave us only yesterday, He might well give us the chance to say to them, 'Be still and know that I am God.'

When we pray for peace, let it be peace as a result of a good will and a good deed; not as a result of hate and anger.

"If violence is resorted to for any purpose, the cause must at least be of such a character that its own results do not depend upon violence."

We cannot stop the war, unless we can also stop the killing of one another; there is too much hatred in the world.

There is plenty of suffering in the world. There are too many hungry people; let’s not deceive ourselves that this is caused by our own actions.

"I have two brothers, and I love them both."
