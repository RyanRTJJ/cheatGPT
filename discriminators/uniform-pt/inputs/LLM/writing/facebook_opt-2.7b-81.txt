*If it were to be adapted.* I'd probably give every character a unique personality and back story that would set them apart from one another. For example, a young man gets shot down in an overseas war and then meets the other pilots who were shot down. Then they each have a different relationship with the pilot that saved them. Or have a young boy and girl who fall in love and they have to find a way to work out their differences before the war comes to an end.
Yeah, it's up to you how you wanna go with it. Just let me know what you get.
That's really the only direction I could take it in, so here we are. The story is set just before the end of the war. They're all in a large compound working on a special project, that the leader of the group was holding dear. It will hopefully work on both the small scale and the large scale, and it would have a pretty happy ending too.
Sounds pretty good. I'll read it tonight.
Thanks a lot! Just let me know when it's complete. I'd love to see what you did with the story.
Don't you mean when it's finished?
Yep, whatever floats your boat. Thanks again.
I think that you should probably fix the paragraph "and the leader of the group was holding dear." It's pretty disorganized there.
I have no ideas on how to fix it :/ I guess I was just going off off of what I typed before. Also, you should read it, it's really good.
