The watch was a gift from my grandmother, heavy and engraved with intricate lettering that made it look antique even though it had only been in her family for a few decades. I loved it when she first gave it to me, and I wore it faithfully every day. But soon after I had begun wearing it, I noticed something strange. While the watch looked and felt as though it was running and ticking away just like any other watch, the second hand never moved. No matter how hard I looked, it stayed locked in its place. Every now and then, I tried to make it move, but after a few attempts, I gave up.

I could've tried to have it fixed, but some part of me felt too deeply attached to the timepiece to ever consider it. I still wore it every day, never taking it off. It became an extension of me: a constant reminder of my grandmother's love, the relationship I had with her, and the memories we shared. Every time I looked at the unmoving second hand, I felt at peace. Even though the watch did not work, it worked in a way that was uniquely special to me. This watch wasn't a time keeper; it was an emotional keeper.
