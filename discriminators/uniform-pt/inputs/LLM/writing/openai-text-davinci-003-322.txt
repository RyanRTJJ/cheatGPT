John had a strange problem. For years he'd had large gaps in his memory, and he was convinced that the answers lingered within them. That was why he'd decided to use the newly-available memory erasing technology to try and fill in the blanks.

However, before doing so, he came across a note he had written himself months ago. It warned not to use the tech, even if it seemed like an answer, and that he should never use it for his own knowledge. In the end, John had followed the note's instructions and never looked back ... until now.

He was determined to find out the answers hidden in his past, whatever the cost. Taking a deep breath, he pressed the button, and waited for his mind to be filled with the forgotten memories.

But nothing came. John had expected horror and anguish, but instead he was filled with a strange kind of peace. He realized that he already knew why he'd chosen not to use the tech in the first place.

The gaps in his memory were the result of some traumatic event he'd experienced in his past, and somehow, his subconscious had known that it was better to not know. As he processed this, an immense gratitude and love filled his heart. John no longer wanted the answers to his questions, because the mystery was part of himself.

So, with newfound understanding and reverence, he decided to leave the unanswered questions in his past and move forward. He was content and happy with the knowledge he did know; and what remained unknown, was more than enough for him.
