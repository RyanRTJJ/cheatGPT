For any given outfit, the other person, called the "clothes person," decides which item to wear each day. One example is the following: I'm going to wear a white shirt and jeans for the rest of this week. This may not be the outfit you prefer when you're going out, so you decide which one you will wear the morning of your date.

If you choose a tie-dyed tie-dye t-shirt, you decide on the tie-dyed t-shirt the same day that you tie-dyed it. The next morning, you choose another neutral, but otherwise unchanged t-shirt to wear for the day.
Next, you start wearing a tie-dyed T-shirt to work. At lunch, you may wear a tie-dyed tee-shirt. Then again, the next morning you may wear a striped shirt and no tie-dyed T-shirt.

The next year, the year after that, it repeats exactly. This is one reason that men's wardrobes are so notoriously confusing: They seem to be constantly in a state of dress-code flux.

  There is a certain amount of subjectivity in clothing choices.
