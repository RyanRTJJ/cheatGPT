  I'm a writer, I like writing stories, maybe I'll try something.
That would be excellent. I'll keep you posted  EDIT:  Well, I tried a short story I wrote over the summer. It was horrible in every way. I have no writing talent. I've never written fiction.  So this is a whole different ballgame. I'm sorry. But I'm glad you enjoyed it. You don't have to do anything but respond to me, and I'll post it to here when it's up.
Hey, I didn't suggest anyone do my job!   But I will ask if any of my friends are writers? I'll let you know if I hear back, and any new people to the subreddit!
That's a generous offer. Thank you very much.  To be perfectly honest, writing to me is much like playing an instrument. It's something that comes naturally to some people, and it's not at all something that should be encouraged.   I'm really just looking for people to write with. I'm not looking to be published. That'll come if I keep writing. But like I said, it's nothing I ever want to do professionally.
Haha, just kidding. But I can tell you that you have not written with anyone I know, which is why I did.   You must write. :)   The way you wrote this (I've never had fun writing/doing a fiction piece before!) makes you seem like an amazing writer, and your prompt has piqued my interest! I'll keep you in my thoughts :)
Thank you very much. That means a whole heck of a lot.  I hope it was as interesting to you as it was to me. I had fun writing it. I always do.
Oh, it was. It was really interesting. (I also wrote a short story today, about a robot apocalypse)  Is a good day for that.
