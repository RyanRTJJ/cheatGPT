I am sitting in the park, leaning against a tree. The tree itself seems to be made of wood. At least the roots are covered in moss. The leaves are green. There are flowers growing out of the tree. As I’m sitting, I can see the grass around the tree, and there are many green blades like the ones growing around me. There are also black and brown leaves. They must be part of the flower. The flower itself is beautiful, yet strange. The flowers make me think of something otherworldly. The flowers have four long, thin stamens. The top of the flower resembles an apple. On top of the flower are four long, thin stigmas. The stigmas at the top of the apple are as thin as the stamens. The bottom two stigmas are a bit thicker. I can also see veins on the leaves. 
  I get back on the bike and ride back home. I don’t see the leaves on the bike. When I get home, I take the bike into the garage. I take off the bike helmet and hang it on one of my hooks. The bike itself is in a box in the corner of my garage.

How did you know it was a tree?

In my experience, people who do this normally describe all of this information without first observing it.

If you were observant, and if your memory were good, you might recall the color of the leaves or flowers and the shape of the flower head, depending on how familiar they were to you.
Or they could describe how the flower head looked relative to the leaves or the shape of the foliage and flowers, and you could deduce it.
Or they could describe both the leaves and the flowers.
They could describe the shape of the stellae or the stem. The stem could be very tall or very short relative to the tree it was on.

The fact that they describe all of these things at first, rather than looking at them first, suggests that they were looking at the tree, but were thinking of things like the color
