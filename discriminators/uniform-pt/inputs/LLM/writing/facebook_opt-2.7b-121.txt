 What would turn you on the most to be made into a movie?
Interesting...  That would be the painting "The Marriage of Figaro" by Botticelli. Not because I think it has anything to do with my submission, but I can tell you that in many different contexts that piece is the most powerful of all.
What about the picture of a woman, naked but partially clothed? Does it have anything to do with your submission?
Nope. Just an old favorite of mine.
Do you have a favorite sigil painting?
There are so many sigil paintings it really hard to point out a favorite.
Interesting. What would be your dream sigil painting?
Perhaps this one...  The "Uniform" from H. G. Wells' "The Time Machine"... (It's a picture of an armor-clad human wearing a suit of armor.) Maybe "The Girl in the Forest" by Rembrandt.
Is this an armor suit with one shoulder exposed, or just a naked woman?  Would you like to see yourself transformed in a sigil movie?
It would be with the armor suit. And yes, I would very much like to be transformed into some sort of sigil.
Do you think you can pull off the transformation?
Yes.
Okay! So, in a sigil movie, you would want to be played by a real-life model, or maybe a porn star...
A model is much more appropriate.   You're right about the porn star though. I thought of that.
I'd love to hear you explain why!
For the obvious reasons. Plus, I've read some fanfics in which the main character has a sex change. It'd be nice to see it on film...
I just need to see how they could portray it without being embarrassing and off-putting to everyone. It's hard to find a good medium for this sort of thing...
