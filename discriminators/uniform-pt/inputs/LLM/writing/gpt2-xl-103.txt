 This prompts is a perfect intro to the new idea for me. This is a pretty much perfect prompt for this story.  I'm surprised by how well this has turned out so far! If you give this a try and like it let me know!  Also if anyone thinks it deserves more love I can always create more short fiction. Cheers ~ -Javis (I had mentioned in the last posting that if I didn't post more regularly that this was going to be another one of my longer stories but I'm afraid that isn't right.  I have a couple of short stories out this week and some other stories coming out over the next few months.  I still have a few other projects on my to-do list for next year so I may not have many long stories out when I post my normal updates.  Just looking for your feedback and reading what you all think.  I still have to decide what my next story will be after I finish this prompt.)
In the quiet, dark of a late night, the world seems to have fallen silent. In a remote part of the Kingdom of Heaven's Kingdom, it is late on Sunday evening, and the only sound can be heard is the soft, echoing gurgling of a fountain.
A soft, quiet sound so soothing and inviting, it brings a smile to everyone's lips. A child sits on a bench at the fountain, his arms wrapped around the back of a worn purple blanket. The sounds of the night seem to wash over him, lulling him to sleep. When the small cries for comfort he makes are heard by everyone at the fountain, all eyes turn to see a young boy on the bottom of the bench, his mother's hand raised to shield the child's eyes
