  _First, create two or more scenarios, in which the students have different outcomes. It can take a while to come up with stories. Start with an opening._

  _Write a one-paragraph synopsis of your story. It doesn't have to be a great or perfect synopsis. If the synopsis isn't good enough, the writer won't feel satisfied. The synopsis will tell the reader a story about what just happened. Tell the reader the beginning of your story._

# **COUNTDOWN TO THE END OF THE WORLD**

The world is ending, and so are your readers.

If your first response to the end of the world were to panic, and take out the batteries in the cell phone chargers, you'd be right!

But would there be much of a panic?

If I had to guess, I'd say that the world will probably be left alone. At most, I would expect a few wars that are far more vicious and bloody than the wars we have on this planet right now, and a few small conflicts—like a coup in a small country—that are so small and limited, nobody can be sure of what would happen.

We might just get tired of the pain and blood. Maybe it just takes time to recover from the end of the world. After a thousand years of civil war, famine, and despair, everyone will go on with their lives, maybe hoping that things will somehow be right again.

But there are some stories that have a tendency to go through time. Just because there are no wars anymore doesn't mean that there aren't people being killed—lots of people. And sometimes a book has a story that lingers over the end of the world for centuries, a story that people will always remember.

But I'll give you some suggestions.

It takes a lot to kill a person like me, but you really can't kill me unless I
