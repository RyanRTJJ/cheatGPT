   This story should be a fun rewrite of that.
I will try that next time :) thank you.
Hey, can you tell me the story of your most-told nightmare for when you get back to it? :)
Sure, it's in the sidebar on the page or click the link in a PM.
No, I was thinking about what you were gonna tell me, I'm not in the habit of reading the sidebar XD I think I'll take your word for it, but that's just me and you can tell me later.  Also, what is that prompt?
You know. The one in the sticky at the top of the page?
Hmmm, there is no "The Sidebar" at the top so far
Well shit. Whoops. I hope I've remembered it right, it's been a while since I've checked.
It does make more sense if you use a computer at home. You have to hover over the link which takes you directly to the side bar.  Maybe I'm missing it as well. If that's what it is for sure, then you don't need mine, I already read it a few times.
Oh. Good to know. I just use the app and didn't realize that you have to hover. I'll definitely remember next time. I'm so sorry for asking!
No problem. As a warning, there are a lot of prompts that require a computer to make sense for the first time. This is a good place to start looking though, and in many cases one of the prompts can inspire a lot of other ideas.
Oh, it's an amazing subreddit, don't worry. That's exactly   what I wanted though, thanks :)
Np. I'm glad I could help. I recommend starting here every other day, then moving on to all the other subredits you like. You'll find this place pretty interesting too if you have any questions or need any help.
