RIP Man had been on patrol for hours, and nothing had happened. The city felt like it had gone quiet but he knew that wasn't the case. He was just too late to the scene; he was the superhero who always seemed to come too late to save people in the nick of time.

It wasn't always this way, but lately it felt like every call for help was coming in too late. Whether it was a robbery, an assault, or even an accident, RIP Man just barely missed catching the perpetrator or arriving in time to help.

Tired and dejected, he was about to call it a night when his super hearing picked up a familiar sound. A woman's cry of terror pierced the night sky, and he knew right away what was going on.

He flew across town to the address the cry had come from and sure enough, he had arrived too late. It was a botched robbery that had caused the woman to be in danger, but it was too late for RIP Man to do anything about it.

The woman was already down on the ground, wounded and unconscious by the time he arrived. The robbers had managed to run away, and RIP Man knew that he had failed at his one true purpose of helping people in danger.

He bent down next to the woman and checked her pulse to make sure she was still alive before flying away.

From that night on, RIP Man changed his motto to one of resilience and determination. No more would he arrive too late to help. No matter what, he would be there in time to save lives and stop criminals before they
