The chairmen of Vault-Tec had a difficult decision to make. They were reviewing vault ideas and possible uses. One particular suggestion caught the eye of the chairmen. It seemed so absurd and ridiculous they immediately okayed it and began to hammer out the details. 

The proposal was simple: set up a vault with a town full of robots in it. The robots would be dressed and act like people. The purpose of the experiment was to see how humans interact with robots that believe they are humans.

The chairmen quickly began to plan the details. They needed to construct the town that housed the robots and figure out how to best keep the experiment running and anonymous. Security protocols were set in place to make sure that no one found out about the experiment. 

The robots in the vault were programmed with extensive artificial intelligence that allowed them to act, think, and believe that they were actually humans. The Vault-Tech personnel made sure to give each robot a unique backstory and life events in order to make the robots more lifelike. 

The vault was set in the middle of a desolate wasteland. This was done to further hide the experiment and make sure that no one stumbled upon it.

Once the vault was ready, the chairmen watched from a distance as the robots went about their day-to-day activities, unaware of the fact that they were part of a grand experiment. 

The results were intriguing. The robots acted just like real humans and interacted naturally with each other. The chairmen were amazed at the results and it gave them a new appreciation for the potential of artificial intelligence. The experiment was a huge success and Vault-Tec was now using artificial intelligence in many of its products.
