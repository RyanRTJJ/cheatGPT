______________________________________________________ #2. ______________________________ The Fated One #2 Author: ______________________________________________________ Title: ______________________________ Title Link: https://archiveofourown.org/works/11279340 Tags: (WARNING) Male protagonist, post, The Fated One, Death, Magic system, magic, romance, angst, rape, violence, implied, necrophilia, blood, violence, possible torture, rape, bondage, death Note: I had read this as an X-rated short story, but never actually bought it, I think I was in kindergarten though. I did this to make the prompt more readable and more interesting since the ending (in all honesty) was totally awesome anyway. I was a huge fan of the X-rated books as a child but had a hard time getting into the adult X-rated titles in general after puberty. I ended up using the X-Rated version for this one to avoid that dilemma. _______________________________________________ #1. _____________________________ The Fateful One #1 Author: _______________________________________ Title: _____________________________ Title Link: https://archiveofourown.org/works/10402552 Tags: Male Shepard, Male Shepard character, post, fantasy, post-apocalypse, sci-fi, romance, worldbuilding, sci-fi, space, sex, rape Note: It has been some time since I had read it, so it took me a little while to finish this one. (Haven't heard any positive remarks about it since the fic started.) So I decided to finish the fic I had started for the prompt (because the fic was a lot more short than the prompt was.) The only other prompt I have had (as of writing this version) other than the one I had actually read was "The Fallen", so I had to write it on the spot. _______________________________________________
