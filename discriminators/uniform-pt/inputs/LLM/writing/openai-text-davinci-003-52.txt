My job was to save lives, but I had no idea how.

I was the number one bomb defuser in the country. I saved thousands of lives with my skill and expertise, or so they say. But the truth was that I was completely clueless.

My biggest trade secret was that I had no idea what I was doing. I had no qualifications or credentials, but I did have an uncanny ability to disarm explosives. I was almost like a child playing with a toy. I would take apart bombs as if I could see the wiring and parts inside without any help.

My boss, who didn't know my secret, loved to brag about my successes to the press. He was amazed that I could do something even the most experienced bomb technicians could not.

In short, I was an enigma. But I did my job to the best of my abilities, hoping each time that I could save lives.

At the end of the day, what mattered was that I did my job and saved those lives. I can only hope that my secret stays safe, for if anyone were to discover it, who knows what would happen.
