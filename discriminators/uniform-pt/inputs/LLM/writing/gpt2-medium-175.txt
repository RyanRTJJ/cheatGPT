 The door to the left leads to an ancient temple to a dragon god, while the door to you is locked and sealed by a thick wooden padlock.  If you are looking for the key to open the two keys to you side of the temple door, you can now simply press on both.  However, if you just look in your left hand, you can see your path in the distance and will receive an invitation.  If you simply ignore it, you will get a message that no player or NPC will be able to gain access to your level.  When you are asked if you want to proceed, you must answer the following: No, you can't answer the call:  the map shows you are on an island near a small lake that you can pass on the way out of the temple door.

Once you have answered all three questions, the map will be turned white with a small compass and the compass will show you where you are
