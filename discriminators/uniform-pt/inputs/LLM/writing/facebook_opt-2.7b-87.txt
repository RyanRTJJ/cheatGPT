       For example, as a young child, this woman doesn't care about clothing. As she grows older, she begins to realize other people see her as "different".
I really like that! That could be really interesting. I'll definitely think about that one. Thanks for the suggestion!
Glad someone appreciates it. Have a good day! üôÇ
I will. Thanks for the suggestion! :) It's gonna keep me occupied for quite a long time XD
If anybody is looking for a good read try ‚ÄúThe Stranger from the Stars‚Äù by Peter F Hamilton.
> The Stranger from the Stars" by Peter F Hamilton.  Thanks for the suggestion :) I'll definitely give the book a try!
No problem, I hope you enjoy it.
Thanks! I'm looking forward to reading it. I hope it's not too long XD
I personally like his slower writing style, I could be in to it though I've only read the first arc.
Wow, that looks like a really interesting book! I'll definitely check it out! I could really get into it!
It is honestly the best book I have ever read. I don't recommend it too much as if doesn't quite go the way he wants it to I guess :/
I've heard nothing but great things about The Culture books! I definitely want to see that happen someday. I might have to pick some up now üòÅ
Yeah it is really good, I want a book out of culture so bad
I'm sure he'll release one someday! Just to be different, they're set in our world but about 2,000 years in the future.
Yeah, it's definitely a good book. They're awesome so far. The Culture series can keep him busy for centuries so I hope he doesn't run out of ideas by then. They're a perfect mix of sci-fi and fantasy
I have a feeling he's not too far
