Alice was an eight year old girl with a very large dark secret. Though outwardly she seemed like a normal, if slightly mischievous, girl, her parents and teachers knew better. Alice had a sociopathic tendency hidden beneath her outwardly charming and sweet facade. She lacked empathy and often neglecting the basic moral codes most parents tried to teach their children.

It was the week before Christmas, and Alice's parents had brought her to the mall to visit Santa Claus. While other children excitedly ran to him and shared their Christmas wish-list, Alice quietly stepped onto his lap and stared at him with a combination of curiosity and indifference.

Santa, aware of Alice's particular personality traits, gave her a knowing look before giving her a small gift.

"Happy Christmas, Alice. May you always treat others with respect ... itâ€™s the least we can do," he said with a twinkle in his eye.

Alice silently thanked him, taking the gift and quickly retreating to her parents. On the car ride home, her parents talked about how much Santa had taken a liking to Alice, before finally noticing the small gift in her hands.

Alice opened it to reveal a snowglobe with a small figure of Saint Nicholas inside. In that moment, something inside Alice changed. She couldn't explain it, but she felt warm and fuzzy inside.

From that day forward, Alice tried her best to be a more compassionate and understanding person. Though it wasn't always easy, Alice knew that Santa definitely had the last say.
