 1) Talk to the ghost of their childhood self. 2) Ask them whether they love them. 3) Ask them whether they feel like garbage.  See what sort of stories you get. You could be writing in prose form the entire time, or you could use that as the foundation of a story in verse.
Hmm I like this and I might have to steal it. I've written short stories in the past and would like to give some more serious thought to it!
It's good, yeah? My stories take a lot of detours over a wide area because I'm always thinking "this has to be how this person feels" or "this really should be what my protagonist is thinking," etc., but that's part of the fun. It takes some discipline, though, and being dead doesn't really help.
I've never written but I would be interested in reading one of yours at some point. I think that's part of the problem with coming up with a story in my head. I can't imagine how much of a challenge it must be to be able to write a "full" story with a prompt. I've always gone off topic and it's never been that great, let alone writing an actual story. Maybe if I put some real effort into it, who knows what I could come up with? :)
Right now I'm working on a collection of short stories in verse. If that goes well, I'm sure I'll take another stab at a book in prose, then hopefully go for something as ambitious as I did when I started the other day--fiction in prose, then poetry. We'll see how that goes!  But I agree that a prompt is really a tough thing to write against.
