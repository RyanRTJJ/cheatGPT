   What happens?
LOL I'm not even fat or lazy. And I've definitely had to work at being less-dumb. But you have to admit, the idea of the network people pulling me back was hilarious to me in some way. Thanks for the entry.
You're welcome. I don't mean you have to make me feel bad for telling this joke. It's a comedy show. No one should come here expecting any serious writing.
I know, I didn't say they *were* coming here expecting serious writing. I just don't think they were expecting *that* specific sort of serious writing- i.e. the kind that would make them laugh out loud. You can say there's no writing, in any story, and someone will think it's funny. That's just a matter of perspective. I'd have to ask you why you're saying I don't have to feel bad for telling this joke.
I was just going with the joke. Sorry I wasn't clearer.
I've been on an emotional rollercoaster of sorts lately and my sense of humor is wavering. I apologize for that. No harm done. Thanks for the help today. I'll see you around.
That's OK. I like to stir things up here and there.
Well, if you keep *stuffing* us, maybe we'll end up on a bigger level, right?
Maybe, but I'll probably be stuck between an angry person and some sad people.
In that case you need to up the stakes a bit. This is important to me.
But I'm doing well. I'm not doing it for me, I'm doing it for the redditors. I know you're out there.
