As a father, there had always been a special bond between me and my daughter. She was my little girl and she was always a bit of a magical prodigy, always seeing the world through her own unique lens.

At first, I thought it was just my daughter’s unique imagination, but then one day I found out the truth. My daughter had the ability to summon the things she desired the most–including me.

At first, I was a bit frightened by this power, but I soon came to realize something great. Whenever my daughter was in any kind of trouble or danger, she always summoned me first. I felt humbled and honoured that I was the one she wanted to protect her.

That’s why I began to take extra special care of my daughter, doing everything I could to make sure she was safe and well. I kept an eye on her, watching her every move to make sure she didn’t end up in any kind of trouble.

Things only got more amazing when my daughter started showing signs of summoning other people or things she wanted. One time she even summoned a cupcake which I had to eat in front of her.

My daughter’s ability had become a bit of a family secret, but she never abused it. Although she had the power, she was too innocent to understand what it meant.

To this day, I still feel in awe of my daughter’s power. I’m thankful that she chose to use it to keep herself safe, and that she continues to summon me first when she feels scared. I know that she knows I will always protect her, and I pray that this bond of summoning will keep us safe and connected forever
