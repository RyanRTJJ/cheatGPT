Alice had always been an extraordinary person. She was a conscientious, hardworking individual who had achieved more than most. Each day, Alice faced her tasks with enthusiasm, and when she wasnned her suit and combed her hair each morning, she had no idea that she was fulfilling a greater purpose.

Alice had been created to serve as a guide for others. Her life was not about achieving personal gain and recognition, but about helping her fellow man. Throughout her life, she had mentored students, supported colleagues, and dedicated her time to numerous charities. She had served as a pillar in her community, offering her wise counsel and kind words to those who needed it the most.

When Alice passed away, she was at peace. As she crossed the line into the realm of the afterlife, she was humbled to discover that her life was part of a greater plan. The master plan was to help one another, and she was proud to have been chosen to share her wisdom and guidance.

Alice did not expect any reward, as she had already received the fulfillment and joy of seeing the positive impact she had on others. But upon her passing, she was allowed to step back and see the bigger picture. In that moment, she knew that her one specific task had been to serve as a beacon of light and hope in a dark world. For that, she was forever grateful.
