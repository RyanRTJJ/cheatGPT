Sarah had always been a bit of an optimist. It didn't matter what situation she found herself in, she always found something for which to be grateful. That outlook had held steady even in the toughest of times; like when she was diagnosed with a rare and incurable illness.

Sarah was well aware of her mortality, but she had no fear of death. In fact, she was rather intrigued by it. To her, it was not something to be feared but something to be accepted, something that could bring peace and closure.

Recently, though, she had begun to feel a strange warmth in her heart whenever she thought of death. It was like a deep sense of comfort and understanding. When speaking to her doctors, she noticed that despite their grim prognosis, they were moved by her strength and courage. She was certain that Death was appreciating her positive attitude in the face of adversity.

The more that Sarah thought about it, the more convinced she became that Death had come to admire her. It was a strange feeling, but it brought her a sense of peace. She was no longer afraid of Death. In fact, she found herself oddly grateful for its presence in her life. With Death's companionship, Sarah was certain she could face whatever life threw at her with strength and courage.
