Once upon a time, in a kingdom far away, there lived a young king who was good and just. He truly wished to maintain the peace of his kingdom, but did not have the resources to punish criminals and keep the peace.

One day, as the young king was strolling along in his castle grounds, an ancient being appeared before him. She raised her staff and declared loudly, "I come before you with a gift that will bring justice to your kingdom. Take this relic, for it will mete out justice to the people and keep the peace, but use it wisely young king."

The ancient being then disappeared and the young king, confused yet intrigued, was left alone with the relic in his hand. He looked it over and saw that it was a glowing staff. Touching it curiously, he was amazed when the staff suddenly lit up with a brilliant white light.

He figured out his newfound power quickly and set about using it to mete out justice in his kingdom. He soon acquired the nickname of "The Enlightened King," as he quickly became known for his ability to distinguish between the wicked and the righteous.

Using the relic, the young king was able to bring peace to his kingdom. Criminals were brought to justice and ordinary citizens felt safe living under his wise rule. He set an example to rulers throughout the land with his use of the relic and he went down in history as a great and just ruler.
