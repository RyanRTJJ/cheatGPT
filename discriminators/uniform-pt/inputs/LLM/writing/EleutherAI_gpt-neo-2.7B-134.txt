In my story, the monster in this case is darkness. The darkness I fear most isn't darkness itself, but the monsters that hide in the shadows. In my world of darkness, the human hero is one of the most rare and mysterious creatures that could be found anywhere on the planet. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________This is a story I'll be going on a trip with my good friends, so I'm writing a story based on the four of us staying in a hotel. So there will be a lot of talking. But the one thing that will connect every other story is my main character, who has decided to become a monster. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

One of my students is an aspiring comic book writer, so I decided to give her the writing challenge of using the following words, and then choosing which one to use. She created characters that didn't exist under my rules. My rules are to stay with the one word and to use the correct number of lines. What word should I write? What number of words should I use? What number of lines? What word should the students get? Please share your thoughts

There are five different words: four in each line, and the fifth will be "s".

Please write the answers to each prompt from a student's words into the last column of this page. Thank you!

"It's easy to imagine a better, more beautiful world in which these rules do not have to hold true." _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

[ TT ] If you ever do have a chance to meet him, please make sure you introduce yourself by saying 'hi, I'm...". That way you don't have to start every sentence with Hi!

[ TT ] The word for "I" in Spanish is el and translates as "the" not "one" (or at least more accurately, than English).

So you might say to those you're meeting "hi, I'm so glad I could help you today."
