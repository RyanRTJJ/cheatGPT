This is the story so far:
We're having fun. We're in the playground and we've managed to escape. The kids run around freely being kids. We jump into their treehouse and watch a little TV.
The kids are doing a good time. It's not so bad after all. They've even got a lot of chocolate, and no one is complaining until... "THEY" come.
THEY come out of nowhere. All they've done is come out of nowhere, but we're all surprised. We hear them, and for the first time hear their terrifying laughs. The laughs that they have. For some reason, we've heard that laughter before. The laughter of someone who doesn't feel the pleasure of fun.
They've come out of nowhere and now they want us.
In a panic, I try to grab the kids to move them into the main building.
"But the kids!" It's my fault. It's my fault that they're being taken. It's not the kids' faults. They're innocent. But they're being taken, and I have to think of a way to save the kids.
THEY stop playing games. They start to laugh and laugh and...
"Noooooooooo!"
A scream of pure misery. If I could only save the kids, there is some way to end this. My head spins in circles with the thought of how to save the kids. I must save the kids...
"Noooooooooo!"
More and more children are being forced into their... "home." There are just so many children. The laughter is drowning out the sounds of children screaming.
"Noooooooooo!"
I think we'd all love to scream too!
