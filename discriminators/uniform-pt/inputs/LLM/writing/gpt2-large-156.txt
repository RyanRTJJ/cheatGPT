 Go to the cryogenic room for 1 minute.  Then do the above 3 steps again to turn back into a human.
This story is about you. Please take the time to write a story based on this prompt: You are in a long-term relationship with someone; their current relationship ends.  The relationship had its ups and downs, the person in it was not always good to you.  They stopped sending you a text for several months, until they finally said they would.  You've been dating for 3-4 years, and finally they tell you the good news.  You wait until they are home from work, and they let you take a shower, and make breakfast. At the end of the day, they want a kiss.  You jump in the shower, and they pull you to the bed.  They tell you it's okay, and they ask if you want to do whatever it is they were doing.  After a few minutes they remove their clothes, and you make them your new love.  Now, this has really fucked up my normal relationship.  I cannot go to her again, and will not get back in the same relationship.  My friends and family are still going full steam ahead, and I will never get back.  Thank you as always for taking time to write a prompt for this character.  If you have a moment, you can check out my submissions page.  I'd be happy to see what yours would be.
You'll be back later this week with Part 6, where I'll finish out the stories of a number of character designs I love. Thank you for joining me!
