--------------------------- Write about another character within five feet of you (it doesn't matter if they're a player or NPC or otherwise.) --------------------------- Write about a situation directly related to your own. --------------------------- Write about a situation as opposed to thinking about (as opposed to thinking about the story as opposed to the characters within it). --------------------------- Write what an objective-oriented character would consider a fun, challenging, or complex situation: As often as possible, make these situations easy to solve. --------------------------- Write about a character you're not familiar with, but would assume a similar amount of experience to you. --------------------------- Write about a situation involving someone else in the story.

For some things, writing about something you're not familiar with doesn't take a ton of effort. Some people (most notably me) are a little reluctant to try and describe things that they're not familiar with, because a) they don't really know the story well, and b) they've always wanted to try writing about something else. Others are less willing to write about things they're unfamiliar with and don't know all the details of. However, if that's your experience, what I'm suggesting is that if you're going to try to define something in words (because you're really interested or don't really have a grasp of the characters, or because you think you could get away with writing stuff like "the sun is hot today") you should try to write in terms of concepts or archetypes. You'll probably end up writing with the idea that something's cool if that character is the "cool one" at some time, but your writing process will most likely revolve around understanding the characters and trying to describe those people realistically through the framework that they appear here.

In sum, in order to write and write well, you need to think about things and write around them. To do that, you'll have to start thinking like a writer. When you try to write like a writer,
