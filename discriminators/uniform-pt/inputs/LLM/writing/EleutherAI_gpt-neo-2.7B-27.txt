My first suggestion is to add the word "unreliable" but then I've no idea what to do more.

A:

Unreliable

I would suggest the author does not trust his/her partner in this instance. Or perhaps  a friend's?

  - The driver was going for a drive around a new area. His/her car took a detour to get him home, but then was taken over by ghosts. They were not acting malicious but they were certainly unreliable, and they only wanted the car.  

Reliable

Another thought is that the road is very dangerous, which leads to people being killed on a regular basis, hence the driver should trust no one. Or the opposite (and perhaps the author is playing with the story to show something is not as reliable as it might appear.)
  - The car driver dismissed it all, thinking people were prank-ing them for the Street View.  

Reliable or unreliable
  - The vehicle itself

I would avoid use of "unreliable" directly and instead use the adjective unreliable: 

  - The car could not be driven. The driver was unable to drive it.

  - The driver was unreliable

  - The driver was unreliable

A:

I'd suggest unreliable - A Google Street View car driver goes through a new area, only for very strange things to happen around them. 
The car driver dismisses it all, thinking people are pranking them for the Street View. 
The car driver dismisses it all, thinking people are pranking them for the Street View.
Unreliable -  A road that is very dangerous, which leads to people being killed on a regular basis, hence the driver should not expect any trust in the road, or the opposite (and perhaps the author is playing with the story to show something is not reliable as it might appear.)
