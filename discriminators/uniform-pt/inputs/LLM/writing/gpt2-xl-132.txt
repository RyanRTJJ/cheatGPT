 I sat on top of my patio furniture in shorts.  I was on my favorite back patio I've ever been on, overlooking the water, the grass, and the trees.  I'd lived here before, but I'd never been as comfortable as I was today. It's about 5 pm on a glorious summer day.  It's sunny, it's warm, and I've walked to the end of my back patio to sit in the grass. I am completely comfortable. I've got a cool drink in one hand, a fresh magazine in the other, a light scarf draped over my shoulders, and I had just finished reading one of my favorite books when I heard a knock at the front door.  I thought nothing of it. After about 15 minutes, a young girl came into my back porch, carrying a small, plastic shopping bag. She had a huge smile on her face.  She reached over and tugged on my sunglasses.  She said, "Hi, this is Kate.  I want to give you a book, can I come in?" She was beautiful.  She had a huge smile, straight, glowing green eyes, and her hazel hair was auburn, bouncing like a ball.  She wore a black leather jacket with a red rose print, white tights with black ankle socks, dark blue jeans, and boots.  I reached over and took her hand.  She looked at me, smiled, and squeezed my hand and I smiled back.  She said, "Hi, it's great to finally meet you." She lifted her backpack, and she said with a smile, "This is it.  This is what I'm going to be reading." She gave me another small, thick, plastic shopping bag.  Just looking at it was all I could think about. I asked, "You don't have any other books?" She told me, "I brought this with me the first time, it has everything.  It's just nice to have something
