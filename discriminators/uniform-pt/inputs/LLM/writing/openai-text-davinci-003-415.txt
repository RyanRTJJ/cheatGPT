Ten years ago felt like yesterday. The events that unfolded were unimaginable. I still remember waking up to the news of a race of shapeshifting aliens that were determined to take over the world. They were cunning and relentless in their pursuit.

As the news spread across the globe, entire countries went into a state of panic as citizens desperately tried to protect against the alien takeover. Governments around the world teamed up in an effort to form a defense.

I remember watching the battles that ensued, the total chaos the aliens created, and the fear that filled the country as we waited for the aliens to be rooted out and hopefully defeated. Little did we know at the time that the fight would be a success and that the aliens would be eradicated, all except for me.

I was one of the aliens; however, I had the ability to control my shape-shifting powers and the self-control to ensure that I used them sparingly. Thus, I managed to not only survive the alien war but also remain in hiding.

For ten years, I've lived in fear, not fully knowing if I was going to be discovered as one of the alien survivors, a fear that held me back from engaging with society much. Despite the fear, however, I still managed to build a good life for myself within the limits I had.

Yet now, I'm ready to step out of the shadows and rejoin humanity. But the scars of the alien war run deep, and I can't help but wonder if I'll be accepted, or if I'll remain misunderstood, an outcast of sorts.
