I'm doing it by the numbers. At least. But you can always make the numbers work. Like, say all the same number of steps, and let me make a few mistakes. Like when there are nine steps in Chapter 2. Or when you're trying to say your name in Chapter 1. Or when there are four steps in Chapter 3. Or when you've been counting all evening.

And then you're going to have a much more consistent final outcome. Like if there were only two steps in Chapter 3, you'd probably tell your friends you missed something.

And that would make those five extra little clues of yours come back just as good as they'd made at the end of the first chapter. It's so much easier there, since you don't have to rely so much on things just ending up there. You're able to go into every step the way they'd been and know why you're doing it. There's no surprise to it. It's just how things usually go.

And I like that.

You see, the two things I'm saying, "Don't let me decide what to do," really work together. They both help me stay away from just about any problem or task, but rather, make sure I'm choosing a logical course of action. So the obvious question, "What is making this choice? How's it making you do it?" comes up. And the only way I know it exists is because you're trying to put a price on my suffering.

If I'm trying to leave you, and say it's okay to let your partner leave, then you'll know that I would consider it. Not because of anyone else's preference, or your own good faith, or anything else that I should think about or know about.

But also because we're here. I want to try to be useful. I want to help. And I should, in turn, be helping you. And I am a pretty good person at that too. But it takes much more time than ever before to come to your attention. It doesn't just take a moment, it takes
