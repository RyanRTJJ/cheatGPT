Possible solution (just a speculation, I don't know to be exactly the order and such!)

 This might be an interpretation of the famous Shakespeare play Hamlet, when Hamlet is on his way to be executed. 
 In the quote Hamlet is talking to his mother, his main concern is how to live after he is dead and he asks the ghost of his father to appear to him to show him the life, but the ghost turns out to be Polonius, a man Hamlet killed, then Hamlet kills Polonius in revenge, and he goes to the place where his uncle waits, he has a speech about how he killed his uncle because he thought him a weak king, but then he discovers that his uncle was the one who helped him killing Claudius. On the end of the play Hamlet chooses to return to his mother instead and dies.

An idea that I thought of.
Let's say that the world is the place where his "luck" came from.
This world is a place where most people are just like him, and he kills them all. He isn't supposed to be the nicest of the bunch... but still a "hero" for killing them all. So, being the best hitman, he has no problem being the nicest as well.
So that leaves us with a situation where:

He is about to be promoted.
He is about to be "killed" (actually dying).
He doesn't know it, but he just made the luckiest man in the world, and the best hitman in the world.

 (This man is also the king (at least in this story, there's many kings). The king wants him dead, for doing something the king doesn't want him to do. This is the final "hit" (like the "unlucky man"), but the king also realizes that this man is the luckiest man in the world, and also the best hitman
