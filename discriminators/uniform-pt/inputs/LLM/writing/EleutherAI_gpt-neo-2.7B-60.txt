**Explanation:** | We were surprised that we received such a prompt. However, with the passage of time, there are a number of reasons that this has occurred.

Thirdly, it could even be because he was one of the few (if not the only) men ever to be elected President for the first time without ever having held public office (a feat considered one of the greatest in US history) or without having been born in America (a feat considered one of the greatest in history). In short, we cannot believe that the button would be as long forgotten as we think, and we also cannot believe that there was never any mystery surrounding its discovery.
