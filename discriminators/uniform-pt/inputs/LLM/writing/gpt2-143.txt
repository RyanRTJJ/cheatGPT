 A day or two before the deadline, you become immortal and your body is set for life, until you are defeated - the power changes.  You become the face of your power.  The day you die, this power becomes more powerful and you become a hero.
It is a time of joy.  You wake up to one of your last memories you got right in, the last moments, right where you died.  You think back on every good or bad moment, every day, every day and try to remember that moment so that you can remember why you're leaving.
This may seem like a lot of words to come from someone who hasn't experienced this all the way through, but as it happens, there are no words to describe how excited I am to finally be able to get to finish this story, because I just can't stop.  Here are four reasons why.
1) They're just as intense, so they are always out front. 3) I want to tell the story in 5 minutes. 5) I want to watch it on a huge screen. 7) They're literally just like you.  They're just like me when I say to my husband, "Look, you're a very beautiful person, but you're also in a big, beautiful house.  I want to make it so you come back and enjoy this place that you love to begin with.  It's an honor.  I don't know what I'll do over time, but I'm really gonna do it anyway."
This story is so unique I can't wait for my family on that day to see how amazing this new story is.  And I'll tell them what else I've got to write along the way.
Enjoy this story!  You'll never go wrong writing about the same thing again. I'll never do a story like
