 (Make a story outline and a sub-headline. Do not say "but" or "buts" unless they directly contradict each other.  In fact, use all parts of your story to describe the world, not just the first or second paragraph.)  Write the actual words that are said.  That should be enough. Be honest, with yourself. Do you always have to use the word "but" when talking to a new person? Do you go into your own head and write everything that goes over your head? Do you have these habits?
Do you never take your time?  Or is there a way to make up for it with an amazing story? What is something that you do to make the writing process more fluid?
How does your story start?
How do you feel about writing in a notebook?
How does your story come to you?
When you are done writing your story, you can keep it in a folder, or you can type the first few lines. You can save the story to your drive, and give it to someone you like. You can put it on the computer and print it out, and mail it in.
How does the story change over the course of the story, both in terms of your characters and the setting? Do you write more about characters as you're writing the story?
