The shock and revelation was so staggering, it took humanity's collective breath away for days.

But as the knowledge settled in, humanity realized what it all meant. We were, in essence, just tiny little pieces of code in a much, much bigger game. And so, out of spite, humanity decided to concentrate its efforts on messing with the civilization that was doing the simulation.
