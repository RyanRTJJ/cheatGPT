I had been told growing up that I was special, that I had been “engineered” to be perfect. In school I excelled, I could speak multiple languages, and I was almost too smart for my own good. Everyone said I was a model student, so why wasn’t I happy?

I kept seeing that look on my teachers face, a subtle hint of suspicion. When I asked my parents about it, they simply said I was “overthinking it.” But I knew there had to be something more to it.

Finally, after much begging, my parents revealed to me the truth. I had indeed been engineered in a lab before being inserted into the womb, and I was perfect… for the most part. But, genetically speaking, there were two very small irregularities in my DNA that had the potential to cause me problems further down the road. No one was really sure how it would affect me in the long run, but the truth was undoubtedly out there.

I was relieved to finally know the truth, but I also felt scared. After all, no one wants to be different. I was desperate to remain “perfect” like I thought I was before. But I also knew I had to come to terms with the fact that I wasn’t actually perfect, and that I just had to make the best of the situation.
