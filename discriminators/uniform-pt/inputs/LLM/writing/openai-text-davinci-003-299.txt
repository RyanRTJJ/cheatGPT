The little ants hurriedly scurried along, ever aware of their surroundings. They had been sent on a mission to find the fabled abandoned ant colony, a quest that promised riches and glory, but so far they had only encountered dust and cobwebs.

Just when they were about to give up hope, they stumbled upon the long lost ant colony. Excitedly, the ants climbed the walls and explored their new found treasure. However, their excitement quickly faded as they noticed the walls of the abandoned colony were littered with cryptic warnings.

"Beware the human," one message read. "They bring destruction, signaling the end of all anthood."

The ants shuddered. They had heard tales of the mysterious humans and their ungodly power. The brave few that ventured outside the colony rarely returned, and those who did told stories of the Human's oppressive force and the devastation that followed in their wake.

The ants quickly reverted back to the safety of their tunnels and tunnels, never venturing out again. Days passed, and soon the ants were safe and content again. But every night, they huddled around the warnings scratched on the walls, a constant reminder of the power of the Human and a grim portent of what could be.
