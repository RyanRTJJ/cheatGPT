 That's what it all boils down to.
That sounds like a scary story.
Oh definitely, it'll be a nice change from those "I'll do anything for love" ones. It'll be a challenge, because there will be no doubt that she knows the risks, but she will feel that love anyway.  That, and I'm planning for him to be the one who actually kills her because he won't stop loving her. That part kind of makes it a fantasy at this point :)
It sounds more frightening than terrifying... I think I would read it if it had more details. If you have any more details I'd be happy to add them to your story.
I've decided that I'm going to hold off on the chapter at least until today, because then I'm going to have someone else helping me with it and it might not be as good. It's taking a little while to write. What details are you interested in?
Just a few. So she's an American college girl. She's had a few drinks. She may have been taken advantage of before. What is he, and what is he expecting of her? And what does she feel? And what does she expect of him? Also, why does she care so much about how he looks?
I agree with jaxonj. I would add details to the story. A lot of details. I'd include the drink, her having had a few.. and maybe a detail on him. I think that will help you nail down the tone a bit. :)  I'm not sure. She's not sure what kind of relationship she has with him. He's an older man, has a few kids.. and is looking for a little something different. I don't think they're strangers.
