Wow. That's actually a really great prompt. Thanks a lot. I'll get started right away.

Oh, I'm going to send it to you as well. But I might make my own little story, for my own amusement. Like the one that I'm doing with OP. So you might have to wait a little bit for that.

My bad, I should have said only two or so people. I will look up some of your other stories. I was thinking of reading your ones to get feedback as to how I could improve them.
I'm glad I was able to influence such
