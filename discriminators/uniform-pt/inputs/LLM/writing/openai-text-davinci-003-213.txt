The town of Galt was a sleepy one, filled with the kind of people who were content with their lives as they were already. They were not looking for excitement and adventure, just a quiet and simple existence in the small Ontario fishing town.

Today was not like any other day in Galt, however. On this day, a terrible accident occurred and changed the town forever. The local fishing boat, the S.S. Tragically Hip, had been missing at sea for over a week. Everyone worried and hoped the crew would be okay, but the situation looked grim.

Suddenly,a glimmer of hope broke through the clouds. Miraculously, the S.S. Tragically Hip had been spotted a few miles away from shore. The crew had managed to survive out at sea, but the boat was wrecked beyond repair. The townspeople decided to salvage whatever they could from the wreckage and pay homage to the Tragically Hip in the process.

It wasn't long before the stories and legends of the Nautical Disaster spread throughout Galt. Every single member of the Tragically Hip survived their harrowing experience, and the boat served as a powerful reminder of how fragile life can be.

Generations later, the people of Galt still remember the Tragically Hip and the Nautical Disaster. They still breathe life into the legend, and make sure to remember this piece of their town's past. Every generation of Galt has a few passionate activists who want to make sure the Tragically Hip and their Nautical Disaster will never be forgotten.
