There are two questions I'm currently trying to solve before I move forward. 

Would it be possible for me to make my own character?

The way I see it, I simply don't have enough in-game experience.
For example: What type of clothes would fit my personal appearance. Or perhaps,
How should I dress to make my character look like they are on the verge of breaking?

A:

Dressing your way into a new character is certainly possible. If you haven't played GTA before, there are plenty of tutorials available online. I'm going to assume that you have.
A simple tutorial is to simply follow the same outfit that you are already known in. It will probably be easiest and quickest to stay within the basic body types that have been given for the tutorial. With clothes being one of the most obvious aspects to notice of how a character looks in-game, it will be fairly simple for you to create the appearance that you have always wanted.
Now, it's not entirely perfect. In particular, clothing tends to look more realistic if you match your face and hair with the clothing. Additionally, clothing tends to change with the weather. Most tutorials won't explicitly mention that you'll eventually have to pay money to change clothing. They're almost always completely fine as is, but you'll need to figure out how to obtain currency and pay the shop owner a lot.
Now of course you can create your own clothing as well. This isn't easy, and there's not nearly as much tutorial available for it. That being said, I'd suggest this tutorial. They're an excellent video on how you can create everything except for the clothing portion.
Now the other aspect of clothing that is relevant is the color of the clothing. Colors can be hard to pick out on a person in the game unless you happen to get to see a person's shirt from the front. If you look for a tutorial on how to change someone's color of hair, you'll be surprised and
