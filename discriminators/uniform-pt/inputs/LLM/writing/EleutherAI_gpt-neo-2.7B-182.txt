 
This is the third chapter of The Book of Lost Tales (published May 5, 2013).

I am writing an episode for Star Wars: The Clone Wars and the show is a prequel to the original movies.  The main characters have already completed the original trilogy, but we will see them in the prequel era.  When you read this, tell a story that takes place before the movies of the original trilogy began.  What do we take for granted, like, a lot of stuff that the Star Wars universe provides us with? What do we not, like, see things like the Force and maybe the Death Star? And what did we learn, like, about our ancestors? Did we find out if we died? If we did what did we learn from those experiences, like, how was our legacy set and how should it be set?  I also would like to use the prompt to explore why we should or should not be interested in the prequels.  I am interested in exploring the topic because there are not a lot of shows that attempt to look into history and the past by using a prequel character perspective.

My story would have to be set somewhere in the prequel timeline, but the setting could be anything from 30 years prior to the original films to around 50 years before the final confrontation with the Jedi.  It could even have happened just before the first battle with the Empire.  As the story progresses, we find out some stuff about what happened when certain aspects of prequel time were altered by the events of The Clone Wars and The Clone Wars Omniscient.

Use the question, What do we take for granted? at the beginning of the story and then create a back story.

The first question about the Force is the most important but the story also might get into various
