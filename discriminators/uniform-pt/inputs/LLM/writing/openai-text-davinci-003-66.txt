When everyone else had deserted Jenna, her best friend had stood by her. She was forever present--working to help Jenna in anything she needed and always being by her side through hard times.

Jenna had been facing a lot of problems recently; her parents had already given up on her and she was alone in the world, or so it seemed. That is until she had met her best friend.

At the time, Jenna had just felt the need to talk to someone who understood her and cared, and her best friend had been the one who had been willing to listen, give advice and just be there for her.

But lately, Jenna's best friend had been acting strange and distant. Whenever Jenna asked why she just said "I'm fine," without any details or explanations.

Jenna had noticed the change in her best friend's attitude and she was growing concerned that the person who she had looked to for so much was pulling away from her. 

One day, when Jenna was alone, she heard the door open and her best friend stood there with her suitcase in her hand. Tears pooled in Jenna's eyes as she realized that her best friend was leaving her in her time of need.

“Don't leave me,” Jenna begged. “You're my best friend.”

Her friend put her suitcase down and walked over to Jenna, embracing her in a hug.

“I'm not leaving you. I'm only going away for a short while to take care of some business,” she said. “I promise to come back and help you when I'm done.”

Jenna wiped away her tears and nodded. She knew that nothing would change
