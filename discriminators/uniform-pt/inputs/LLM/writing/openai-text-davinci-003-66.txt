The village of Pupril was built on the edge of the great forest that had been home to countless generations of dogs. While it was a small village, it had seen its fair share of bittersweet moments.

Today was no exception. 

All the dogs were aware of what was happening - after a lifetime of devotion to our pack, our beloved caretaker was dying. This human had been a part of our lives for more than 500 years, which was a more than impressive feat - even amongst celestial beings. He had watched the village grow, and over time, he had become an integral part of our pack. 

The sad news was hard to stomach, but we knew it was time to pay our respects. 

As we gathered around him, he shared his last words with us, “I have been blessed to spend my life with each and every one of you. I’ve seen seven generations of your family come and go, each one of them more precious than the last. Take care of each other, and always remember that happiness can be found in the simplest things.”

We all agreed that his words were wise, and vowed to remember them for our remaining years. We howled with grief as the caretaker of our lives and the past seven generations of our family stepped into eternal sleep. 

Our days would undoubtedly be different, but his memory would remain in our hearts forever.
