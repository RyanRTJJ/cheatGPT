Ten years ago, the world changed in ways I could never have predicted. A race of shapeshifting aliens had come out of nowhere, intent on taking over human society. They were agents of chaos, destroying everything in their path in a mission of madness.

At first, few believed they were more than an urban legend. But before long, they were everywhere, infiltrating every part of human society. They seemed unstoppable.

That was until the humans discovered their Achillesâ€™ heel. By uniting our forces, we were able to outsmart the alien hoard, rooting them out one by one. Eventually, we succeeded in driving the invaders away. All of them were killed, that is all but one.

That one was me. Somehow, I had managed to survive where the others had failed. In the chaos of the fight, I had learned to use my shape-shifting powers to blur the lines between humanity and alien. I hid in plain sight and became something entirely new.

In the years since , I have worked as an intermediary between the human world and a new alien one, doing my part to keep the peace. It hasn't always been easy, but I have done my best to ensure both species can live peacefully together.

Ten years later, the threat of alien invasion has faded away. But for me, the memories remain. I survived the fight, when so many others did not. I am a reminder of what we are capable of, if we stand together to protect what is ours.
