 I'm going to have the characters name them in red letters on their bodies.  I'll call them:  "Bait", "Folly", "The Dark" and "The Death", respectively.  I'll have the names of three "villains" in black letters on their bodies.  I'll have each character's names in a different font (it's important to me that you've seen each character's handwriting before).  I'll have this on all of my text.  I'll also write the name of the writer of this story in boldface.  But it's better this way than what this post shows.  Here's what it looks like.
The first couple of words:
Hollow-Face.
The first thing you notice immediately is what's missing on this person:  A name and the date of birth. They are just blank shapes.  I used a font with an outline in front of the characters that I'm going to explain so that you know what was going on here.
The characters that I'm going to name are "Hollow" and "Face."  What's missing are the three letters for "Bait", "Folly" and "The Death".  There is one "Death" character and it is completely covered in ink.  You'll notice that it doesn't look good.  There's no character letter that's above a 'O'.  As such, I'm going to use a single 'A'.  I won't be using extra space here - just a single dash.  Now I'm going to place these two types of characters, "Bait" and "Folly" below and you may add a space between their names to add or subtract character. Here's what the text looks like. The title on the side-line looks like its been stripped away after putting "Bait" and "Folly" below it.  Then I've been removing everything below it.
Next up, I
