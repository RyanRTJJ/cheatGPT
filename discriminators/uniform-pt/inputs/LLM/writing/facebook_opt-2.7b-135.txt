 This poem is good and all but don't waste your time with an unnecessary poem. The story is more than enough.
You're probably right. I'm not trying to force anything on them, just writing to help someone out who may not be able to find someone. The story idea is an alternate universe to the poem. I appreciate your input though, I appreciate that. :)
Okay, I'll be honest, if you don't have any readers on this sub, it's not going to generate a lot of interest. So I personally disagree with what someone else said, but to each their own.  If you have any other stories you want to share I'm more than happy to check them out but this is just not a place to share these kinds of poems. Feel free to read the other comments and maybe see how they do without the poem, because you won't be getting any views on this one.
Alright, thanks for the help. I'll be sure to put my next story in the proper place. :)
I'll be happy to check it out, I wish you all the best. Writing is one of my favourite things to do and there's so much good stuff out there! Keep it up!
I'll most certainly keep it up. Thanks as well :) you're probably a good reader as well. I'll probably add you and read your stories. :) thank you so much.
You're very welcome :) You should know that there are very few people on the Internet or even on Reddit in general you should be able to count on to check your stuff out and help you out
Oh definitely, I've tried to stick around with just a few people but I haven't had much luck with that. I'll try my best though. Thanks again for your input. :)
