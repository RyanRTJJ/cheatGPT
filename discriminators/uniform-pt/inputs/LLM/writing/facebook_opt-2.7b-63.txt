 Thank you for doing this.
The weapon that won the war is a sword named the Sword of Omens, forged as the weapon of an old prophecy about the battle that would end all wars. A mysterious object was found in the desert. A small group of soldiers decided that it was the sword. They called it "the Sword".   That's about it. I really don't have much to offer. I'm not a good writer.
You know who is? YOU. Keep working on it and you'll be one. You just need practice. And a good story to draw the reader in!  Thanks for participating.
Thank you so much! And I'll do my best to get started. Thank you! :)
Hey, no problem. I love seeing people get inspired. :D Best of luck! This is great! This one was great. I'm sure you'll do well with more.
Thank you so much. The support and the actual help just means that much to me. :) Best of luck to you too!
No problem! I know how you feel. I was in the exact same situation. And the best thing I did was get an agent who helped me build my first book. He's made it a lot easier. Best of luck! I think we'll be writing a little more often together!
That sounds amazing! I hope you find success with your story! And the same goes for me :)
I've got a few. I'm sure you'll find yours. Just keep doing it. And thanks for the support! :)
You're welcome! I'm so happy to be here and feel so inspired! I can't wait to do more!
I definitely would love that. If you'd like some advice or have any questions about our writing process at all, just shoot me a message. Or better yet, drop by the discord. If you can't, that's fine!
