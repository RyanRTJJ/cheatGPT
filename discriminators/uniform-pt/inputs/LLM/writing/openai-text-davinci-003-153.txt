Once upon a time, there was a curious little scientist named Bob who had a deep intuition that something strange was happening in the world.

One day, Bob was conducting an experiment in his laboratory when he stumbled upon an astonishing discovery. Bob had noticed that different areas in the population seemed to be more inclined toward eating chocolate than others and that the same people seemed to eat an immense amount of chocolate.

So he set out on a mission to uncover the truth. After researching and studying the statistics from various different sources, he came to the realization that most of the population was in fact, walking chocolate factories.

He had stumbled upon Nestle's shocking secret. Nestle had bribed the government and had essentially blackmailed the population into the acceptance and regular indulgence of the chocolaty treats.

Bob knew that this had to be exposed and quickly shared his remarkable discovery with the world. After spreading the word, a massive public outcry emerged - and soon enough, Nestle was ousted and the secret became public knowledge.

The population was relieved to learn the truth and to know that what they had always thought of as "shit" was actually edible. Nestle had refined the smell and texture of the chocolate, as well as added extra nuts, making it more enjoyable for the consumers.

After this, Bob and his team of scientists were recognized for their diligent efforts in uncovering such an important truth about food production, and thus ended Nestle's reign of deception.
