 Try not to get into any details in particular or anything.  Just make it about how it sucks to move.
This could work. My main problem will probably be finding a good ending.
You have an idea of the overall story you want to tell?
Well, I wouldn't say a story, but more of a poem. I'm looking at the fact that moving doesn't change anything, that it's all still the same.   I'm also a terrible poet, so I'm going to leave that to the skilled poets of reddit.
Write a poem or story... I'm at work right now but I'll post some things I've written in the meantime and we can compare notes.
I'll do that. Thank you.
No problem, I wish you all the best.
So the poetry came out really good! I'd say I got the gist of the story, I just need to get more specific.   Thanks for the encouragement!
My pleasure.  Try writing about how you feel. What you're afraid of or what scares you. What you want to do.   That seems to be such a powerful thing for writers and readers alike.    Good luck!  Edit: I'm also a teacher so I love encouraging my students to write.
That is a very good idea. I have thought of doing that before today. The problem is, that I can't think about something else to make myself cry when I'm going through an especially tough, sad time.  Thank you for the advice, this will take some getting used to, but I'm glad I can still get things out of my head to keep them from overwhelming me.
No problem.  I just feel it's a powerful way to convey emotional states. Especially when you write a poem or a story. I always feel like they're a little more personal for me than something like a journal entry.
