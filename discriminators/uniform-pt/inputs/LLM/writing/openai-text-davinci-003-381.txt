Renee dearly hoped her luck had finally changed. Here she was, standing in a dingy lab of some unknown industrial building. Surrounding her were disheveled scientific instruments and bottles with beakers filled with mysterious fluids. In the corner was a figure draped in a long black cloak, towering over her and masking his true face with a wide hat. 

The figure held out its hand towards her, an unseen smile on it's face. Drawing back its dark death-like fingers, it asked in an intriguing voice, "Deal?" 

Renee hesitated a moment before getting the courage to speak. She cleared her throat, nervous and shaking. She had heard of such deals before and they rarely ended well. Yet, here she was, presented with the best chance she had. Taking a deep breath, she finally replied, "Yes. I accept your deal."

The figure extending its hand moved closer, until she could see its face in full. Death's smirk gave away his satisfaction. "Very well," he began. "I will make sure you never have to worry again if you follow through with this."

Renee saw the end of her struggles in sight. No longer would she have to worry about the future. She might finally have a chance at a better life. She carefully accepted the deal.

Death smiled, as he expected her to. He took her hand and shook it firmly. "It's a deal then," he said with finality. He cast a spell, a simple but effective one, and then slowly faded away, leaving Renee alone in the room wondering what would come next. 

One thing she knew for sure; her life was about to change.
