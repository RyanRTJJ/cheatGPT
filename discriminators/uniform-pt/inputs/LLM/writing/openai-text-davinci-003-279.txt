Cindy had come to the beach for a peaceful afternoon away from her work and the hustle and bustle of the city. She was hoping to find some peace and quiet and so she strolled slowly along, watching the waves and breathing in the salty air. As she walked, her eyes scanned the beach for anything interesting and that was when she saw it.

Cindy's eyes widened with surprise as she spotted a bright green bottle washing up on shore. She walked over to it and noticed that it was an old-fashioned glass bottle with a tight-fitting cork. Her curiosity was piqued, so she picked it up and carefully removed the cork. Inside was a rolled up piece of parchment paper.

As Cindy unrolled the paper and read it, her mouth dropped open in shock. It was a letter, dated 101 years ago, and it was addressed to her!

She read the parchment over and over, tears streaming down her cheeks. It was a final letter from her great grandfather, written just before he passed away. She cherished the letter and put it in her pocket, keeping it close to her heart.

From that day forward, Cindy would hike out to the beach every week, and spend her afternoons watching the waves roll in and out with her great grandfather's letter in her pocket. His words gave her strength and comfort during difficult times, reminding her to be kind and brave, and to never take life for granted.
