 How much will you be willing to pay for the journal?  What items need to be in the journal?  Who is your main subject?  Tell me about it! And don't forget to leave a comment:)  As always, thank you for reading! This blog is dedicated to the people who are going through some of the toughest times of their life...and I'm really lucky to be able to help them with each step they make to get back on their feet. You never know who might read your message.  And most importantly, you know that I'm never gonna let you down. See you soon, and take care! *I wrote the first sentence of this blog in a journal entry from 10 years ago as a college student.  What an interesting time and a fantastic time to be a college student!  I hope to keep blogging throughout my life so that I can encourage others to take advantage and get the very best education and personal growth possible.
