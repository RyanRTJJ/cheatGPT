The year is 2044 and the world is ending. Everywhere around me I can feel the planet shuddering as it comes undone. With only seconds until the end of everything, I can feel myself slipping away. 

The last thing I remember before it's all over is the life I used to lead, but it's not quite my own. I see myself as a different person, with a different set of experiences and memories that aren't my own. I can feel the joy and the sorrow of someone else's life flashing before my eyes like a dream. 

My old life is a far cry from the one I lived before. Instead of spending my days in a cramped office, I'm sailing around the world on a yacht with the love of my life. Our bond is strong and unbreakable, and we share a passion for travel and adventure. We've explored so many places and experienced things I never dreamed were possible. 

I never expected to wind up living this kind of life, but it's been full of joy and happiness. It's also taught me something about myself. That despite the darkness of the world, I can still find beauty in the simple things. 

As the world ends and my life flashes before my eyes, I'm filled with gratitude for the time I was given. I may have been living someone else's life, but I know I was able to make the most of it and leave a mark on the world that will never be forgotten.
