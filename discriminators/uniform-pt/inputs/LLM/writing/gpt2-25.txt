Dear Sir

I have just received a message... I found, in my inbox, a link that was posted to the post by the author, saying that it says, at the bottom of the "What Does Protein Do?" you and your fellow Redditors should read it. No doubt some of you might think it was just a joke... In the context of my blog- I read the post because it is so good, especially compared to my previous information and I was interested in your post that was posted on my blog about something like protein, I can see how I may have read it wrongly: "... the post says, while it says "1 lb of protein per day - a low carb, high value protein for those who can't lose weight in the current diet, may provide a meal that is high in protein and carbohydrates which will cause weight gain and the benefits of exercise should be considered when choosing a protein source." As well, I have previously read comments at the time on one of those comments that say, you are saying that "L.V. Protein should include no refined carbs, and the nutrition content of the food should be lower and less saturated and cholesterol free than those of refined carbohydrates." As the comments said in my post, I was reading as if I was reading an attempt to mislead people. So, please forgive me, even though I didn't actually read them.


To all of you who are interested in learning something new here is the answer, there is no such thing as "losing weight in the current diet," there are foods, and I am not advocating on any of that. Rather, as I say, the information and advice is there (more or less) that makes my post possible. If you find the information here useful, we'd love to hear what you
