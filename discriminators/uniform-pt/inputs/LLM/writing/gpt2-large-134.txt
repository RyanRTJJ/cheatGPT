______________________________________________________ This isn't a contest. If you can't say a word, then you are not a part of "The Game". And if you say no to a "game", then you are not a part of the community that made it. Do not ask for feedback, that will only bring more frustration. This submission is made for the enjoyment and knowledge of those who play The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Ocarina of Time 3D. Note that the following questions are not for "real life" situations, but "serious" ones about your games. Questions about your work can be better than this, but also more than acceptable. Thanks in advance for completing this for us! ______________________________________________________________________________ 1. I've heard a lot of negative things about the game and games in general. I've also heard a lot of good things about it. What are your thoughts on the game? ______________________________________________________________________________ 2. Have you had fun playing the game? Is there anything you feel must be removed or improved? ______________________________________________________________________________ 3. There are times you feel trapped in the game itself. Have you had to play around in a few different ways? ______________________________________________________________________________ 4. You can find yourself thinking about how the game is not as fun as you had hoped it would be. If so, how can this be remedied? ______________________________________________________________________________ 5. Do you have any special memories of making The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Ocarina of Time 3D? ______________________________________________________________________________ 6. You have not played The Legend of Zelda or Legend of Zelda games in the past or you feel like you can't make a new one? You do not get this option if you are not a member of the main "Ocarina of Time 3D" community. ______________________________________________________________________________ 7. Have you had to start anew with a new character or an entirely different game? If so, how did it feel? ______________________________________________________________________________ 8.
