Heaven's population had been growing exponentially, even though the angel's on high had been doing their best to keep things in check. But it seemed nothing could be done, and eventually, the cities of Heaven had begun to overcrowd. Slums began developing, and with them, crime swiftly rose. Soon, Heaven was a dangerous place, and the angel's on high had no way to combat the growing threat. 

That's when the Heavenly Council decided to take drastic measures. They sent down an elite team of angels, armed with sacred powers, to patrol the cities and keep peace among the citizens. These angelic warriors were fierce and formidable, patrolling the streets and expelling any criminal activity. 

At first, the citizens of Heaven welcomed the angels with open arms, grateful for their protection. But as the patrols continued, the locals couldn't help but feel like the angels were more of an oppressive force instead of a saving one. They began complaining about their presence, and rumors started to swirl that the angels were bringing more pain and chaos than peace. 

In an effort to win back the trust of the citizens, the heavenly council allowed the angelic warriors to employ more diplomatic approaches to help resolve any civil disputes. Angels began to work with the locals to promote safe neighborhoods, helping to educate children and families. Slowly, the people of Heaven began to trust the angels, and peace started to return. 

The angel's on high looked upon the citizens with pride, for their hard work and dedication had allowed Heaven to return to its once peaceful state. Ever since, the angels have been praised for the work they did in maintaining the peace, and the citizens of Heaven are more grateful than ever for their protectors.
