The news spread like wildfire through the town. Everyone was talking about it; some in shock, some in fear. It had come to everyoneâ€™s attention that everyone in the town was destined to die on their birthdays, but the inevitable could occur at any age. Children, adults, and the elderly alike - all of them were to die on their birthdays.

It was a rather sad concept, and the town was certainly feeling it. People seemed more careful with their lives, worried that they could meet their fate at any moment. Children would often ask their parents if they would die on their birthdays, and their parents would not know how to answer. For no one truly had an answer.

Every birthday became an event of mourning. Every party had a sense of underlying sorrow. People were either too scared or too saddened to celebrate. Everyone was nervous that it could be their last birthday or the last birthday of someone they loved.

The town had started to show signs of despair. People were becoming indecisive in life, worrying that their decisions could effect how soon or late their deaths would occur. Some had made it to their thirtieth or even fortieth birthdays, but everyone knew that it would only be a matter of time before their fateful days would come.

It was a depressing concept, but an unavoidable one. People had simply accepted the fate they were dealt with, gripping onto every moment they had left. No one truly knew when their time would come, leading each to live life to the fullest rather than worrying about the inevitable.
