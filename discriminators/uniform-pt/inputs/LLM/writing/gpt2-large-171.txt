____, and you want to scream, "Gotta get out! This is how it's always gonna be! This is who we are. This is life, and I'm gonna kick your ass until everyone's dead" or something like that. Just don't make it sound too scary. What about a "The elevator is going to take you to the top and you'll end up having your throat choked" or "You're going to be murdered, my friend." Not too scary? Write a story that starts before you get stuck on the elevator: You get stuck on an elevator with your boss because you're the only one whose job it is to keep the doors open for everyone else but you, too. You try to argue your point, but he keeps saying things like "This is why we have to have a pay raise" or "But it's so hard." He doesn't know that there's another way to get them to listen. And then you realize that the way out of the situation isn't going to involve shouting at the elevator, but instead it's going to involve convincing the boss to hire people more talented than you. Write a story that begins immediately after you get stuck: Your boss asks if they can buy you a coffee. "Why would I need a drink? We already have coffee in the office." You decide to show off your coffee machine and try to impress him by making him try one. However, he cuts you off. You can always sell him on coffee machines later. But right now, he's just a lot of work for a few coffee grounds. And you really don't want to get to know him when you go to see the movies. But your coffee-machine story is actually going to have more moving parts than a basic coffee machine story, so no worries. Write a story that begins at the moment of getting stuck on an elevator: What if you are stuck on an elevator with some very nasty people
