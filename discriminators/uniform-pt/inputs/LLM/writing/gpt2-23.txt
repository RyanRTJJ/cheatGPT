 On the other hand the Japanese see an opportunity to take their interests very seriously.  If they want Japan to remain in Asia – a position they did not have in the past – they must change their minds about the UK.                That doesn't mean that they haven't seen the future of war with the US. They want it to stick.               The US is determined to not only maintain American hegemony but also to protect its interests, while Japan has a responsibility to prevent America getting to the bottom of the matter.

Nor is it in the business of "doing something for Japan".  It's one thing to defend your interests and a very different thing to make your interests as important as ours.  It's something else to decide to do nothing.  You have to be prepared with a clear and informed position and an obvious answer.              "We don't want to give up our military force, and to do nothing we need to have a clear plan to deal with the issue in practice." The only time that you can agree to some sort of plan is if it's something you have signed off on in an e-mail.
And that in itself is important to understand.              If something is going to happen you have to go on your own to get a result because things will become complicated if the solution is not right in one way or another.              In the case of the US, it's not for the sake of the UK to be involved.              It's for both parties.  The same applies for Japan: they must continue as part of it.              However, if the US does want to do something, or if things are going to get bad then the answer is a simple way to get things to go
