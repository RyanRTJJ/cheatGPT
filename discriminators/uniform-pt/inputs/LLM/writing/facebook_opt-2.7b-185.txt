     No really, do it.
I will try! The idea is really good.
Glad to hear it. Now get to thinking.
A dream about this would be awesome! :D
If you can't sleep, I'll do it.  If you want to sleep, I'm not sure the idea of sleeping around would help you...
Not tonight, probably. A story to write and think about. Thanks for doing this, though! :)
No problem! It was fun anyway. Now your turn to write a dream story!
How do dreams work? Do they really go for the more surreal ending, like in dreams?
In a dream, the rules are just "this happened".  In life you have to write an episode, which can have a specific plot and end.
Yeah... This sounds hard.   But, maybe it could be cool, right?
Yes, it could be very cool.  It'll be hard, but it'll be cool.  What genre are you writing exactly?
I'm not sure yet. I have a whole story in mind, but it's not something you can just do while dreaming. So I'll have to think about it.  You?
Hm, that's really cool. The most you can realistically write is a story using all the details and parts of your dreams. The only way you'll get this into one coherent story without losing your mind is to write it out, slowly, and then edit it when you're awake.
Oh yeah. I already have a big part planned, if I can remember it, when I wake up.   The story will be about a young teenage girl, who doesn't know what she really wants. She has big dreams, but when she wakes up, reality sets in.
Aww that sounds really cool.
This sounds like a good idea. This subreddit has inspired me into creating a short horror story that's going to be a bit of a stretch, but I'll do it anyway.
