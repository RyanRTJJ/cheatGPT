How did they end up in radically different years? How did they interact? 

I'm writing this in-universe, so I must describe events with enough detail for the story to be coherent. 
If you think a question or two above is too open-ended, let me know in the comments. 
Feel free to edit if I'm not being clear.

This could be the alternate history of the world, where the German's victory and the Holocaust are reversed. Maybe the "good guys" instead of the Nazis win. Or the opposite, maybe it's the British and they win.

To me this is a "What if" alternative. In this story, there are two possible histories. One history happens to be the one depicted in this story, and all the major events that happened in that history are exactly as described here. But the other history is what actually happened. And in this alternate history, no war happened (at least none known to the characters) and in the history of the story in this universe, Hitler never became Chancellor of Germany. As a result, there is a world where the Holocaust did not occur. In this history, there is a different political regime (one with more influence if you will) that has kept Germany under its boot. So the characters would actually be from this alternate history and in this alternate version, they don't have superpowers. In this history, they are from 2011 and not the 21th Century. So the two time traveling could be from a possible future where World War II never happened, or from a possible alternate history, one, where Germany never became a super power...
So the characters may be from a different time frame, where both World War II happened but somehow the German war effort failed for some reason. 
As far as writing goes, the character may be traveling to the past to discover something, but they were born into this historical timeline where they need to use superpowers to do so. So they have to invent
