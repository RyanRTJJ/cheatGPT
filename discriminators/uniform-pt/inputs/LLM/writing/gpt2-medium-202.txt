_______________________________________________________________________________ One of these is the first time traveler, who claims to be 20 years after the events of his story. _______________________________________________________________________________ The other is the second time traveler: He is 40 years after his encounter with the first. This time traveler has no memories of those times. _______________________________________________________________________________ What's happening in this timeline? Is this part of the same timeline as it should have been?
            Two of your previous puzzles were related to each other so we now have to do another one to tell this story, this time with different characters.  Here's the puzzle once again: One of the people who were present the morning of the present day is present today (it's the same time that the two people are talking to one another). What time should the two have been, in their present, time?
            The second person suggests that it would be 2:30 a.m. or 1:27; both times were correct, but where the world stopped it started anew and there were different changes to the past.
            In this second question the answers are in their own order, but the person who was present at the beginning of the story asks himself: "In what years would you have expected me to have seen things you saw?"  The person who was present at the beginning of the story is in fact the only one who has ever seen changes in the past that would allow for the time traveler to recognize that there were people who lived before those 2:30 a.m. or 1:27.  The other two things here would allow a time traveler to see changes that would allow him to realize what the past is like.
This puzzle is a bit difficult but it gives you lots of insight into the timeline that we need to tell, and gives you time to reflect when you arrive at an answer!
            So let's go back to the previous question, where the events happened, and notice that the timeline in which the two people are
