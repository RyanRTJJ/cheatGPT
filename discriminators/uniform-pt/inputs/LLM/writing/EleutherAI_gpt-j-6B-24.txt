 A drinking problem isn't always just a choice to drink.  I may have a drinking problem for a variety of reasons that don't inherently relate to drinking.  And even if my problem is directly related to alcohol, being an alcoholic itself is not the same as having a drinking problem.  So, write about someone who's got an alcoholic problem, but it's not a drinking problem.

This doesn't just mean 'I have a drinking problem, but it's not like they're a heavy drinker or even really that much of a party animal.'   In fact, I'm looking for the converse of that.
Maybe she/he still has social problems; doesn't really trust anyone or feel very emotionally connected; doesn't feel good about himself; is trying to hide part of whose he has become;  maybe he's had a lot of job related trouble; maybe he didn't go to college; whatever.
Note that I mean real alcoholics; not a person who drinks at a very few or only very high drinking event.  That's another kind of problem.

I'd go with "I can't really call myself an alcoholic just yet."

 I went to the bar for the first couple weeks that I was away, but I didn't feel that I had to drink every night. Eventually, it started to feel like too much of an obligation, and I found myself drinking in situations when I really didn't want to. I felt myself getting lost in that, though, like having my hands tied when I didn't really want to pull on them. Maybe I was drinking too much, but I didn't really feel like I was an alcoholic, just that there was something wrong with my drinking when it got out of hand.

I would say that I have a problem, but I wouldn't use the word alcoholic. I would say that I have trouble with alcohol.

"I can't say that I am an alcoholic, but..."
It doesn't quite work for me. I would think that you might have a "drinking problem", or maybe "a problem
