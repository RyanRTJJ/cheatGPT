 Does this seem too on the nose?
Totally, I have an idea for a series where the heroine is a successful writer. I just wasn't sure if it was actually a thing or if it was all made up on reddit.
I'm not entirely sure, but the "fantasy" genre is filled with these novels with great plots:  Dragonflight by Robert Jordan  The Chronicles of Amber by Roger Zelazny  The Eye of the Wolf by Martin Beck  The Amber Spyglass by Roger Zelazny
I'll add them to the list. Thanks bud!
Check out Philip K. Dick's *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* for the other direction.
And it's not a novel, its a collection of short stories.
This is how I read them.  They are all linked together nicely and it feels like one complete story.
This was my feeling as well. Even though I'd read them separately before hand, they all seem to work as a "season" in one piece of fiction.    The only thing I wasn't really crazy about was the last one.  The ending.  Like I said though most of them flowed to me just like a long poem.
I'm sorry to hear that you felt the ending was disjointed.  Did you feel that way for any particular chapter or just for the whole book?  Do you remember anything else about it?
I felt disjointed for the whole book.  Like an idea that was there was missing when they were done.  I would have read the next chapter right away but at the end of the book, I wasn't sure what to think.  This is the first book I've read that did this to me.
Hmm...I'm sorry you didn't like it, but I could see that happening. It's a bit less of a disjointed experience if you read them by themselves.
