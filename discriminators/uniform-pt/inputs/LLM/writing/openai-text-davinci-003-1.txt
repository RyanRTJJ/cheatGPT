The young high school student stood on the edge of the precipice, his finger firmly around the trigger of his gun. Tears streaming down his face he realized he was about to kill everyone in the school and then himself, in a desperate bid to end the mental distress he’d been suffering for so long. He took one deep breath, closed his eyes, and prepared to pull the trigger—

Suddenly, he heard the sound of someone else pulling the trigger. He opened his eyes to see another student standing at the front of the classroom, gun aimed at his classmates, and firing rapidly. Instinctively, his combat training kicked in, and he charged forward. He used his body to shield as many of his fellow students as possible, while at the same time shouting for everyone to get down.

He lunged forward, tackling the shooter to the ground and managing to knock the gun away. He then used a combined effort of strength and strategy to restrain the shooter and keep him from firing again. After several tense moments, police and paramedics were able to arrive and take over the scene.

The young student reflected on what had just happened, realizing that he had prevented a tragedy. He was relieved that he had been able to stop the shooting, while also still feeling immense pain from what he had almost done. He was then comforted to know that he now had a way to end his own suffering without harming anyone else.
