The city walls came crashing down with a deafening boom. Soldiers of the enemy kingdom swarmed the streets. They were here for one thing - to ransack the town.

The citizens of the small town ran for their lives, desperately trying to get away from the destruction. But the enemy soldiers had breached their defenses and were running rampant throughout the town. There was no escape.

The commander of the defending army was in shock. He had never seen this level of destruction in his lifetime. He picked up a nearby sword and ran to the gate, where he stood in defiance of the enemy force.

But it was too late. The enemy was already through the gate and every soldier of the defending army was overpowered and killed. The commander knew that all was lost.

He bowed his head in grief and defeat, knowing there was no more he could do. He placed his sword on the gate and dropped to his knees, accepting his fate.

The enemy soldiers surrounded the commander and demanded his surrender. He stood firm, determined not to give in. But eventually he had no choice. He slowly lowered his sword, surrendering to his fate.

The commander had lost the battle, but he had fought valiantly. As he was dragged away to prison, he heard the words ringing in his ears: "All is lost! The enemy is through the gate!"
