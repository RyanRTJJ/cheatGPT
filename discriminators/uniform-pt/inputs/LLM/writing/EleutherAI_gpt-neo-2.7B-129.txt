 
If the story is based on a pun, create a new one to avoid confusion. 
For example: We are sitting by the fountain, a lovely Sunday morning. The day is beautiful. Suddenly an angry man comes down the steps. He looks angry. He says angrily, "Hey, are you my mother?" and the woman says, "No, I am your mother". The angry man says, "What are you doing?"

Therefore you may need to re-think "time" as something we would measure in a 'language.' You may be thinking that we may use 'time' as the measure of the days, weeks, months, years, hours, minutes, etc., that we have gone in our lifetimes. This is true, but is an 'arithmetic' that does not describe the whole of it.

It seems that it would be 'arithmetic' to say that I have been there a'month' of time, but not really, and I have been there a month of seconds, but without the true meaning of a month. The actual thing is that
