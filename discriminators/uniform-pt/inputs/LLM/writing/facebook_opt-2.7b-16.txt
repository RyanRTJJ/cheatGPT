  In this case the story needs to be a maximum of 30 words. Hope this helps.
Thanks for the prompt.  This is my first prompt.
Oh, well if you're writing this first prompt you're not likely to have much experience with prompts and what to expect out of them.

I believe the most popular story that's based around this prompt is one called "The Long Night", on an abandoned planet. There's also
