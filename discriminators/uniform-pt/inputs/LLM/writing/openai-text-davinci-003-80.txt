Enter the master criminals. These ruthless masterminds churned out hit after hit, blending the illusion of the fantastical world with the harsh reality of the lawlessness of their trade. Their mind-bogglingly creative stories left readers on the edge of their seats, desperate for more.

The criminals were praised for their artistry, and some of them were even contacted by the government. In an unexpected move, the government offered these criminals immunity from prosecution in exchange for ongoing series of novels.

It was a one-of-a-kind deal and the criminals agreed in droves. Now, criminals were no longer wasting their lives in prison – instead, they were allowed to continue to write and spread their artwork.

The master criminals and experienced authors swapped ideas, learning techniques that pushed the boundaries of crime writing even further than before. It seemed their lawbreaking ways had opened up their imaginations because their stories become even more thrilling.

Today, crime remains one of the most popular genres on the market, with readers and publishers eagerly awaiting the next master criminal’s novel. It is truly a testament to the power of imagination and proves that, sometimes, even criminals can make a positive difference in the world.
