You said it, that's all. You need not say it was your own idea for us to do this, or to write it, or anything else like that. It was a comment on the original piece, and if you wanted to, then you should just be proud of yourself and your own self-worth, but you don't, you're just annoyed that someone has dared to criticize your own idea! I know I'm only one person, and can only say that something like this happens because of the writer's point of view, and they could say that I was madly in love with my boyfriend. But I'm telling you. When I read that comment, I thought, I've never done it, to my knowledge. But you! Me, who always did it, and probably will always do it, but just now that someone has come as a critic and criticized my work. So I think I want to write a story or poem based on that comment.

If you can do it, then please do.

If I say something that is offensive to someone, how can I write a story, or a poem about it? This is my first story in quite awhile. I didn't enjoy doing it, but I do it because it was supposed to be that first poem/story. Now I am writing this because someone has insulted me. And I know you can't say that. But you said in your first comment that you wanted to know the truth. I know the truth, too, I've always done it. But I want to write about this. And I want to know how to do it, though I don't know, though I have never had this experience. So I've done this, and it must be, I have to understand how it is done, though I don't.

So please, is there a way to write a poem or a story about the hate and the spite and feeling sorry for myself in this moment? I would honestly like to know.

I don't know. I guess the hate and stuff is
