 Which does lead to the inevitable question, do I go to my faith?
This time around, we are looking for characters who, with one or more life histories, followed more or less the same creed or faith.  If any of them did not attend school until high school/college, it is a character who is a high-school student of their religious beliefs.  It is not an example of 'I left church because I was atheist'.  It is an example of a character who left their religion and then came back to it.  (This is a long story, but I will just cut it off.  You get my point.  Don't worry, I will end it there.)

And when the character leaves the current religion, you should also discuss the person's beliefs on afterlife and heaven.  This is important so the reader won't feel confused as to which is which, and it doesn't seem silly to use some alternate names.  In that case, describe what people say about it. What happens to the reader if the person becomes a member of the same religion as you?  Is he or she going to heaven?  Does he or she get a happy ending?  Do the things that matter in life matter anymore, or does religion matter so much that one can no longer enjoy a life like it because the person has turned away from it?
