I like it actually!!
So what if all nutrition was determined by taste?
Maybe I can go a little more in depth with the idea and work from there.  Thanks!
It'd be awesome to know more about the subject.     You should totally write a story out of it!     Happy writing :D
Haha, okay! I guess I can throw you a question or two too, but then if you don't like it, I can see where this is going. Happy writing and thanks so much for the suggestions! I'll figure out what else to do with this one.
You're very welcome!      I would have a lot of questions, actually.      Just write whatever you want to and throw away the things I told you.      As much as I'd love to talk about nutrition in the same breath as the color white or the alphabet, I don't think this would be worth my writing time.      Best of luck with your story.      I'm also pretty sure that I'm going to buy you that book you wanted.
Haha, okay! Thanks!! I do want to buy that book, for sure, but it's probably out of my budget just now.  Also the only way that I would consider writing something based on this is if I wrote something related to this, so no problem, I'll write what I want.  I'll probably post something later tonight. Thanks for the encouragement!
Cool.      I'm looking forward to reading it. I'd love to know how you end up liking it. Best of luck with your story.
Thanks! I'll post it when I'm done working on it. I'll probably post it again when I'm done since I want to change a few things. Like making the story more descriptive, adding some questions about taste, and so on.
