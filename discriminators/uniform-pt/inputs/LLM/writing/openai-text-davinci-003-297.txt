I've always been curious about the lives of people around me. As a child, I noticed that sometimes I could remember thoughts or emotions of people I had never met or conversation that I had never heard. I assumed that the memories that I had weren't my own, because I had no recollection of experiencing them first-hand. 

As time went on, I began to become more aware of this phenomenon. I started to pay closer attention to the memories I had, trying to determine if they truly weren't my own. Unsurprisingly, I found more evidence of this unique ability every day, and I began collecting stories other people had told me which seemed to match up with my own memory. 

I quickly became enthralled with this newfound superpower. Every day, I would take a few moments to think back on my own life and see if there was any recollection I could recall that wasn't my own. Sometimes, I'd find a memory that fit the bill, and I'd store it away for future reference.

Occasionally, I'd find myself in the middle of a conversation and suddenly recall something that someone I had never met had told me. I would then retell that story, and my friends would look at me in disbelief.

As I got older, I became more and more convinced that these memories were authentic. Sure, they may not always be accurate, but they were always worth exploring, if only to remind me of how much more there was in the world beyond myself. 

The ability to understand the lives of others, even if it was only through my own mind, was something I never took for granted. I cherish these memories, and I allow myself to experience them all the more because of it.
