 You need to find Door Three.  See below! You will need a phone and your pen + keys  to open the door. God will open you two doors. But God has never opened the God door at this time.  
I haven't had a good day since I moved, so my days are being spent working in a field with a lot of mosquitos.  I was hoping for a lot less than that, but it hasn't been perfect.  
As you move around, you may notice a little gap in your path.  That's because the fields where I can farm are so very far away that the ground is really very slippery.  My husband knows this all too well since he spent hours digging in the sand when I couldn't be bothered to get to the fields to harvest vegetables.  
My goal is to get to as big of a farm the world has seen so far.  When I'm able to, I plan on picking up more than 6,000 lbs of tomatoes, strawberries, and plums.  After that, I'm looking to sell a bunch of these tomatoes and try my hand at organic farming.  My goal is to raise enough money for a school on the banks of this river, so I can send some seeds home with me.
