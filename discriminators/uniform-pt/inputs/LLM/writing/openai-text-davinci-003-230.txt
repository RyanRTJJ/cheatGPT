Pulsing with anticipation, the spacecraft descended smoothly toward the ruddy surface of Mars. Mark, the first man to land on the red planet, felt immense pride that he was the one who would take the first steps on Mars, a feat that many had thought impossible. His spacecraft touched down softly, and he took a deep breath before slowly opening the door.

Stepping out onto Martian soil, Mark surveyed the terrain. It was oddly reminiscent of the desert back home, with sparse plant life and red, dusty earth. He trudged forward, filled with wonder and excitement as he explored.

Suddenly, in the distance, he noticed an unusual formation. Hesitantly, he walked closer, dread accumulating in the back of his mind. When he was close, he discovered it with a shock: the skeletal remains of a human.

Mark felt a sick hollow in his stomach. He looked around, and to his amazement, he discovered more remains not far away. Evidence of a forgotten human civilization.

Mark quickly realized what had happened: many thousands of years ago, the inhabitants of Mars had become aware of Earth and had sent out a scouting mission to investigate. This mission had discovered plentiful resources on Earth and had decided to move the Martian population to that planet instead.

Back on Earth, the resources were eventually depleted, but the Martian people had nowhere to go, as their original home was no longer able to support them.

In that moment, Mark mourned the loss of a once-thriving Martian civilization. Standing in silence, he made a solemn vow to use Earth's resources responsibly, so that future generations would not suffer the same fate.
