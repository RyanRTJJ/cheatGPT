Show an image of a person's head, above their head. ~~

Show a person's head, below their head. ~~

The people who are above you will never look up above you, as if they've seen you. They will always look below and below to them. ~~

The people who are below you will never look above your head, as if they'd seen you. They will always look to you. ~~

The people who are below you will always look off to either side. ~~

It will be shown to everyone who walks through a room by a character, who has the symbol of a person's head. ~~

The person who stands near a person's head will often be wearing a mask that covers half their face, making them disappear from sight, although this is not a normal thing for them to do. ~~

On the other hand, someone who lives alone or is alone will not always turn his or her head aside from the person around them. ~~

This symbol is generally very large in order to give a visual clue to the meaning of this scene: ~~

a) a person always looks to the side b) on the right, there is someone on the other side of you, and you're looking at the opposite side of them c) on both sides, you're trying to look at both people, but there isn't anything to indicate if they're staring at you or looking at the right you've been looking into the left you've been looking out the back of a person you've been staring at or being carried by people behind or somewhere else down a corner. There is, however, always a person either on the left or on the right of you. ~~

One must also realize that this is a visual reference. For instance, the person's head might be on the other side of you. ~~

"How do I know which direction each person is looking?" "Do I look down at my feet to determine which direction he or she will come from?" "What if they turn around?"
