The first signs of a new presence on Mars were met with shock and awe by the human race on Earth. For centuries, mankind had looked up to the stars and dreamed of venturing out to the planets, but it had never become a reality. And yet here they were, an alien race had arrived on Mars and begun colonizing it as if they owned it. 

The alien race completely ignored humanity on Earth and simply went about their business. No contact was made, and no messages were sent. To the surprise of many, the alien colonization was relatively peaceful. The aliens were hostile to any humans that decided to venture to Mars themselves, but they did not interfere significantly with the planet's existing ecosystems. 

Before long, humans had resigned themselves to their solitude. There were no attempts to reach out to the alien race, and the colony seemed content to stay on its side of the planet. All inquiries from the public or from scientific organizations were met with silence or dismissive answers.

Although humanity was largely put off by the alien race's alienry towards them, some adventurous souls still chose to venture out and explore the colony. Although these explorers never received much recognition, their tales illuminated humanity's desire to make contact.

Although it seemed that the alien race was content to stay isolated, stories have circulated in recent years about strange ships appearing in the night sky and mysterious signals emanating from the red planet. What could these aliens be planning and is there really any hope for humanity to make a connection? Only time will tell.
