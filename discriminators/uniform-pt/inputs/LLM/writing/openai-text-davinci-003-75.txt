Jessica knew her time was almost up. She had been struggling with her illness for years, but it had finally begun to take its toll on her health. She was weak and in constant pain, and the doctors had told her that her end was near. And with that realization, she found herself savoring the last moments of clarity that she had.

She recalled fond memories of her friends and family, the simple joys of life that she had once been able to take for granted. She thought of the summers spent foraging for wildflowers in the nearby meadows, or the afternoons spent baking apple pies in the kitchen with her Grandmother. She remembered being young and full of life, and how it all seemed to be over so quickly.

And with her last breath, she let out all of her pain and sadness and looked to the sky. There was a hint of blue and she thought of it as the promise of a new beginning, a way of starting over. With this thought, she found peace and finally let go, understanding that no matter how hard life had been, her journey was now complete.
