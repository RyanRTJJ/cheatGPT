_______. ________________________________________

Your story should be no longer than 1000 words (double-spaced), and should flow from beginning to end at the pace of the story that you have in your head. Please adhere to the template (as much as is possible, but just don't overdo it). The rules of this format are below, and it's worth remembering that your story should be about you and your emotions, as it will be read by someone else.

Do not write your own prompt, but write about the prompt.

There are eight prompts to choose from:

"He was never warm in his entire life. Not once."

"He never saw his parents smile. Not once."

"He was never a favourite around the house, not ever, ever."

"He was the kind of person who got on with people well, except everyone was scared of him."

"He never had a pet; He never got close to animals."

"He had an allergy to most of the foods that anyone else in the world found beautiful."

"He was never loved. He was always alone."

"He was a human being, and yet he felt nothing"

Your story should be no longer than 1000 words (double-spaced). Use the format at the top of this page for your story, but your story should still be a page double-spaced at the most. I.E., use 12pt (not 12 and 1/2 or 13 and 1/2) You must adhere to these formatting requirements, or your story will be removed from the contest.
