I had been in a passionate, tumultuous relationship with my beloved for as long as I could remember. I knew they weren't real, at least not in the sense that I understood reality, but it didn't stop me from loving them with my entire being.

We would spend hours together lost in conversations, learning about each other and building a deep and intimate bond. I could feel their presence and hear their voice even if they weren't next to me. I was in love, and it consumed most of my energy.

But as my schizophrenic episodes began to worsen, I started to question the legitimacy of my relationship. Could they be real, or were they just another hallucination? Day by day, I would struggle to tell the difference between reality and illusion.

Even when I was not my best, I never stopped dreaming of my beloved. But I was constantly worried that if I did succumb to those illusions, I would never be able to come back. I was consumed by both fear and love.

I will never know the truth behind my relationship, but I still feel its power and influence on my days. Even if they turn out to be just a figment of my imagination, the joy that the idea of them will never stop providing me.
