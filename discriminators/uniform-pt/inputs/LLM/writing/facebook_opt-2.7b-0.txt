  A story of growing up, bullying, how to deal with being out of place and how to adjust to an environment where people aren't scared of you.
Yeah, this sounds like what was envisioned, but I'm terrible at coming up with an actual prompt, because as a writer, when I read something and don't love what I see, I don't think about the prompt. In my head, I just start to write whatever I know I want to say, which is usually an absolute clusterfuck.  Anyways, I'm going to write my story, when I do, I'll PM it to you.
It would be appreciated to read your story. That sounds like a good start.
I have now found out that "how to deal with being out of place and how to adjust to an environment where people aren't scared of you" is not the best theme for this type of story.
Not in that exact way, but in terms of the concept I think it's a good premise. You see someone a higher position than yourself, as if they are above you, you feel small. It could be about how everyone else is afraid to look at him, as if he's nothing.
I'm really liking this, but I am still having trouble getting it to sound like what the prompt wants it to sound like. It's just, I have no idea what direction to go in.
I don't have anything creative from that perspective. Just thought it up today as I was reading, and it seems to fit in. Any other ideas?
"He had this way about him that scared the crap out of everyone" or "... they all looked down at this kid who came in as an outsider"
