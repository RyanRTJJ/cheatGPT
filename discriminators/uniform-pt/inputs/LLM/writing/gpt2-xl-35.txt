What is the average amount of money a person has in their bank account?

Note: Our open-source challenge is now available for all to participate in.

Challenge Requirements

Participants should have an internet connection and be willing to provide a GitHub account and make their data available on GitHub.

Participants will be provided with a Google Sheets spreadsheet to facilitate the challenge, and all challenge participants will be given access to the results as well as the results they can make into their original posts on their own websites.
