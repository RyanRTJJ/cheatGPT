Once upon a time there was an awkward person who was used to avoiding social situations. They dreaded the thought of running into someone they knew and especially an ex. It was a blessing and a curse when their work randomly changed them to a new location.

When the protagonist heard that everyone from their previous location was now coming to the same new location, they panicked. In order to avoid seeing any of their exâ€™s, the protagonist went to great lengths. ...

They changed their schedule so that their work hours were no longer in line with when social events were held. They went out of their way to never have to even pass places that their ex may have visited. They gave up all activities or places their ex might be interested in.

The protagonist rarely left the safe confines of their place of work. Whenever they needed groceries or other essentials, they had them delivered so they wouldn't have to take the risk of running into someone they had avoided for so long.

Day after day of this lifestyle became exhausting, but the protagonist kept to it and eventually the all-clear was given. The dreaded ex, who would have surely caused an awkward encounter, had moved on and was out of sight permanently.

The protagonist felt a huge relief, finally being able to come out of their shell a bit more, and went about their life as best they could. A lesson was certainly learned in avoiding all those things the protagonist once did to try and stay away from their ex: the heartache was too much, and they weren't ready to face the situation just yet, but they could finally breathe a sigh of relief when they knew they could now move forward in their own life and not have to worry
