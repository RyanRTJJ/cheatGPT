The aliens had been searching for the perfect mind expanding substances for centuries. After travelling the far reaches of the galaxy, they were sure they had finally found what they were looking for. 

It was a small blue planet, unassuming and unknown, but they could sense a unique and powerful energy emanating from the surface. And so they set their ship down, curious and excited to fill the vessel with the secret to their enhanced mental prowess.

Little did they know that what awaited them on the planet was not a powerful psychedelic but something far more insidious. For as soon as they stepped foot on the surface, they were enamoured. Everywhere they glanced, the colours dazzled, the smells tantalised, and the sounds sated. 

It was as though the planet had bewitched them, for wherever the aliens looked, they felt an overpowering urge to consume. Corn chips, cola, cheeseburgers and Twinkies, the aliens just couldn't get enough. Soon, they had become addicted to the junk foods they found on Earth.

This was the end of the search for mind expanding substances. For the aliens, their mental prowess had been reduced, replaced by a constant craving for all things greasy and sugary. Little did they know that their craving was to be an everlasting one, as they were now destined to roam the planet, forever on the lookout for their beloved junk food.
