 See what you come up with. "Dirt" means something.  It's a lie. Why was "I was in the basement playing with the children" not a lie?  Because, it wasn't that.  It WAS, because, it WASN'T, because, it WAS, because, something happened in the dark bedroom of the apartment which caused the children to start screaming.  But, it wasn't a lie. "I was playing with the children" doesn't mean it wasn't, because, it wasn't, because, something happened in the darkest bedroom of the apartment which caused the children to start screaming. "I was playing with the children" doesn't mean it wasn't, because, it wasn't, because, something happened in the dark bedroom of the apartment which caused the children to start screaming.
What do you tell the next question? "I was in the back yard playing with the children."  In a basement.  BASICALLY, what does it mean you PLAYED BASICALLY WHEN YOU WERE IN THE BACK GARBAGE "WHILE I WAS PLAYING WITH THE CHILDREN?  WHICH OF THE 3 CHILDREN WAS LYING?!"  WHAT IS THIS? "Because," it wasn't a lie because, it was SOMETHING, something happened in the dark bedroom of the apartment which caused the children to start screaming.  But, it wasn't a lie.  It WAS SOMETHING, something happened in the dark bedroom of the apartment which caused the children to start screaming. "I was in the back yard playing with the children" doesn't mean it wasn't, because, it wasn't, because, something happened in the dark bedroom of the apartment which caused the children to start screaming. WHAT HAPPENED WAS SOMETHING,  the dark bedroom in a basement.   "Because" DOESN'T HELP YOU, IT TRYING TO BE A LIE. WHAT HAPPENED HAS MUCH TO DO WITH THE DARK SOMETIMES
