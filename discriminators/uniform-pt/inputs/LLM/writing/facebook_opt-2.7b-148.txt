  Also, check in to make sure you get your submission done before the prompt deadline (2 days). :]
I've been writing a lot, just not here!  I'll get it done tonight, and then post it in here and then the Prompt thread tomorrow.  Thank you, I owe you for a very very kind gesture.  :)  edit: oops, I misread the last part!  I thought it said "2 days after the end of this post".  That would give me 3 whole days!  o0
Hey there, I'm sending you one just because i think it's more entertaining when people have a good sense of humor about themselves and their submissions :)  Good luck!
Oh, it was not meant to sound flippant!  I'm more than thrilled to have this offer accepted, and now it's my turn - do it again!  So I have to pick one that isn't an original piece, since I have one up already that I put a lot of thought into.  Thanks for doing this, I'll probably come back to you when I'm ready for my entry! \^^
No worries! I thought it was funny but then i got curious about yours and i checked.  I really like it but it's a bit too sad to enter... I'm on a weird phase (:   But i'm sure you'll do a fine job!
:P  I was actually in the same "phase" when I first started writing.  If I'd had this, I'm sure I'd just post "this is the worst thing I ever conceived and didn't want to publish!".  I didn't, so I have to keep getting better and better until one day the best will be published!
