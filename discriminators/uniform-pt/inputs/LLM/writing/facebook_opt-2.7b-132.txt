 There was just enough shade for some people to get their sun tan and for others to enjoy the company of their friends and family.  What's the best that can happen?
That is a great prompt. I love it!
I love your stories and think they’re funny as hell lol. They make laugh every time and give me a good, long laugh.  I’m new to these things but already know my next story to try is “The first meeting” and I’m having a hard time coming up with a scenario for that one.
I hope the first one you write is just as funny! I usually write a lot of random comedy, in case I get inspired. There will come a time when the prompts will be hard, so just pick one and don't stop until it's over. Good luck!
Thanks, I really appreciate the encouragement! I’m excited to try this out. Just need to get the timing right 😄
I'm excited to read you make use of this prompt. Do it!  It's like poetry. It's like magic.
Oh my gosh, thank you!   I think my first story is about to be posted and I’m so excited!
Can't wait to read it. Post it and I will totally get a laugh.   I had a girl that I was into that I was trying to convince about this. She's from the other side of the country and it would have taken me hours to communicate. But I'm in a different state now and we have Skype! And text! And email! And... I mean... We've got everything now.
Yay finally!! I just posted.   What do you use to record your videos?
I have an app. It's called fraps. It's free so I didn't have to pay for it.
Awesome. I'll look into it, I need something to save for now.
