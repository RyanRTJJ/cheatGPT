Possibly not my best story, but it sure does get the point across.

A friend and I were standing in line at the cinema one night -- he was first in line! -- when I took his arm and whispered, "If you're going to leave me, my father is the king in a castle in the kingdom of Toulon."
For a moment or two I doubted myself -- this sounded too obvious, it sounded like a lie, and my only defense was that the king of what kingdom? But then I remembered that my friend is, I suppose I had to put it mildly, a bit of a klutz and I decided to stick to my guns.
"Your life is about to change, my friend," I told him, and he turned his ear to me:
"Is there nothing that I can do?" "We can't get married until you are made the duke, and my father has to be the one to make you the duke." And then there was silence for the longest time.
"Do you really think he will?" he said.
"I do," I answered and then he turned his head back toward the people behind him, and then he asked me -- with his eyes -- if I would leave him.
"Do I know you?" I asked.
He just stood there for a moment, his hands tucked deep into his pockets, looking at the pavement between us.
"I haven't seen you before," he answered.
"I'm new here," I said. "But what's that," he asked, pointing toward my ear. "Do you have a voice in that?"
He took out a small wire and hooked it into my ear:
"When can my parents meet them?" I asked.
"Tonight," he said.
I had never thought about what would happen if he didn't get his wish, he still believed in the fairy tale... he had no idea that I knew so much.
"What will they think of me?" I asked. "They'll love you," he said.
