Once upon a time, living in the large and mysterious land of Skyrim was a young, brave Nord by the name of Lars. Lars had been given the large, important undertaking of keeping lit all the candles in the many caves, dungeons, and castles of Skyrim.

It was a difficult job to say the least, but Lars was determined to make sure all the candles were lit throughout Skyrim. He began his quest with the barren caves, and soon enough had lit the many candles that made their home in those places. He then moved on to the dungeons, carefully and cautiously making his way through while lighting the many torches and candles along the way.

Finally, Lars reached the castles. In these large, expansive buildings there were no candles outside of the large throne hall where the royalty met and celebrated their victories. But in all the other vast rooms of the castle, there were candles that needed to be lit, and if they went out, then the entire castle would be enveloped in darkness. 

So Lars worked endlessly, hour-after-hour, day-after-day, to make sure all the candles in the castles were lit and stayed lit. He eventually grew tired and exhausted, but knowing the importance of his task, Lars never gave up and kept going.

Once the candles were all lit and the castles were illuminated in their own bright glow, Lars could be seen throughout the vast expanse of Skyrim, a beacon of light, a symbol of hope and courage. His name was known to all and respected in all corners of the vast land. Lars had made sure all the candles were lit, and for that he was an inspiration for generations to come.
