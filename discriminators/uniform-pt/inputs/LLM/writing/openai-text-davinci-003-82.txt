Within five feet of me lies a round, red apple, resting on the surface of a wooden table. It has a glossy, smooth texture, unmarred by any blemishes or bruises. The top of the apple is covered in a thick layer of white and grey spots, splitting the shade of red into swirls and arcs of different hues. It has a slender, slightly off-center stem, with a few dried leaves surrounding the base. You can tell it was only recently cut away from a tree, given the greenish tint to the stem and the cold temperature of the apple.

The table it sits on is made of sturdy oak, with a deep, honey-colored finish. Its four legs taper down to small, ridged points, leaving a few small scratches in the surface of the wood. The table is mostly unadorned, except for the ornate design etched into the center of the top. It shows the silhouette of a ship with rippling sails, which stands in stark relief against the otherwise unornamented wood.

The combination of the specific placement of the apple and the table create an eye-catching sight. The bright and vibrant colors of the apple contrast against the dark wood of the table, making the apple stand out in sharp detail. The smoothness of the apple and the rough texture of the wood, combined with the ship-in-a-bottle styling of the table top, creates a small piece of art that draws the eye and draws admiration from anyone who observes it.
