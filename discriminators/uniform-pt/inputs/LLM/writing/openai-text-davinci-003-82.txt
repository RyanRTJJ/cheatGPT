I was in a crowded subway station, rushing to catch the train and get to a meeting. The station was packed with people, and it was almost impossible to make my way through the throng. Just as I was about to board the train, I suddenly heard a voice in my head.

"Kill them. See them all stopping in their tracks? They heard it too. Kill them before they kill you!"

I froze in my tracks, barely able to comprehend what I had heard. I looked around at the other commuters in shock, but everyone else seemed undisturbed. No one else seemed to have heard the voice. 

My heart was pounding, and sweat began to break out on my forehead. I knew the voice hadn't really been directing its message at me, but still, I couldn't shake the feeling of dread. Was someone trying to send me a warning? 

I quickly boarded the train, desperate to get away from the crowded station and the unnerving voice. But I couldn't help but feel a strange sense of foreboding. As I glanced around at the other passengers, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was the only one who had heard the warning. I knew the voice wasn't real, but the fear lingered, a reminder that danger could be lurking around any corner.
