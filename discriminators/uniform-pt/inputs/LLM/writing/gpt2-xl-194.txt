 To confirm this suspicion, John enlists him to check out his office and secure a copy of his passport.  Then, John travels to Arizona to meet with McCain's staff to ensure that the senator's staffers are really serving McCain's interests.  They are, in fact, being led by the head of McCain's political action committee, George F. Wilmot.  John meets with Wilmot and discovers that the senator has been using the office for personal purposes and even going so far as to steal from the office, and that Wilmot is willing to stop McCain from making such outrageous claims by any means necessary.  John discovers that the senator may be using Wilmot to cover up the fact that he is cheating the office out of income and is making false claims that the senator owes Wilmot money.  John is able to get both of them out of financial ruin by using his political contacts to force the senator to settle with Wilmot.
Your Name: In Memory of...
Your Name: In Memory of You: Your Name: In Memory of...
The first one, "In Memory of...," is my most popular.  And the second two in the first column, "In Memory of You:...," are my second and third favorites.
The story I'm working on right now is also going to be my fourth most popular, and the seventh in the fourth column, "In Memory of You:...," is going to be my most popular story to date!  It's also something that I've wanted to do for so long.  I'm trying to get it posted and finished by the end of the summer! 
Until next time, may your writing inspire you and your audience.
