Â Here's a list of my favorites, along with a brief description of how I chose them to make the story flow better.
"It's a girl" I think I liked this most, because it's an answer to every story that begins with "I am" and ends with "She..."
"He can understand what I'm saying" A common first choice at the start of a story, but for something that is only about sex, this would be a fairly silly comment from the main character - "She can understand me, and that's what's going to happen." For "You're a girl" it would be a bit more out there, as it shows that he is looking at her body, just as she is looking at him.
"He can take it" This is the standard answer for all of the above types of answers. He can take it in his pants or he can take it in his hands. In either case, the reader's interpretation of the sex act is based on the actions he takes as he is having sex with her. For example, if the guy gives it to her, and then she feels a pleasure, he will see that she is enjoying it and that he is feeling the same. When the guy pulls out, she will think this is the first time she've taken it in her life.
"Oh, that's how he enjoys it" Most sexual encounters are short, and this could be a really nice way to tie up some loose ends, such as who the main character is, or what her hobbies are, or where she lives. And, of course, she might get it if the guy is nice to her with it in his pants.
"I don't want to..." Yes, that's right. The reader's interpretation of this is based on other things, and the real answer is that the character doesn't want to. It is only when the guy is really turned on and
