 After that, he takes his parents to California and lives there as a farmer and fisherman, where he can help people find success. He also collects their books and newspapers on a monthly basis.  His favorite local hero is Hester Sondra, who has just moved from San Rafael to LA.  What he learns most about Hester is that the poor are more happy than the rich.  When he gets out, the rich get more money: $50,000, $500,000, and over $1 million for education and care.
Podcast (Ep 24)
 The Lost City - The Story of The Lost City
 A very common theme in a lot of podcasts from The Lost City. The idea that the city of Derry was lost is almost universal--but this time round, the locals have a very different perspective--the concept of an 'urban legend'. This is a story about how The Lost City was created in a place called New York City. For those who do not know, New York City is the most populated city in the universe, while the city of Derry had a population of 50,000. The locals did not know why, so if this story is accurate, the story began in a place called New York City, which was located east of the Colorado River. The story about where Derry went is based on these two pieces of information:
A story, an idea, and a geography of the country at the time.
A story that is very important to know.
A story about the time when Derry began, and how the stories have always been about an urban legend.
What can we expect from the show?
