 An old lady wants to wear an old red suit, or someone wants to change to a fancy dress, or another wants to do whatever seems the most fashionable. What does this mean for everyone? As someone who grew up dressed the same way as this girl, I have a few observations.  First, people who believe they're old or who feel this way really are old.  Some of them are the older of the two. A couple hundred years is fairly old. Second, because people want to wear a certain outfit, the dress they're wearing is often not the outfit they most want to wear.  If you're wearing a hat and a skirt that aren't the outfit most of your friends and family think of when they think of you (such as "The dress we like is worn by a younger person") and have to stop wearing it, chances are you already have a different outfit for weeks or months and people don't want to believe it.
Third, you don't need to do this. There is a way to let people dress and make friends without believing you're an old person.  There isn't, but it's not impossible.  You can create a uniform and change outfits in this manner.  I know one writer who is convinced at all times she's in her mid-thirties, until she can afford a new outfit and can get over feeling dated and rejected. Her dress is white and faded with the word "HOT" printed on it.  But it doesn't include a jacket, nor a tie. She wears a black dress with white tights and a black dress jacket that she uses every day. Now she has a more colorful outfit than she originally wore until her late teens and she is very good at remembering what she did from that day.
