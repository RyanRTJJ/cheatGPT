The Last of His Tribe by Lila

I had always wanted to write a book one of this kind, though I had little idea of what one would be like.

Now, I know.

It's about the last of the human race. A man with the ability to see the past and future, but also the present—a super intelligence—has taken up residence inside, inside a computer. She is unable to speak due to her powers, and she cannot even look at anything on or outside her computer because of the time delay.

I haven't decided on a plot yet (which is a good problem to have), but I do know the book will start with the Earth-bound human woman in her computer, as she attempts to get to safety.

What I would love to see:

An entire science fiction novel in a computer. _____________________ If there's one thing it does better than any other form of fiction, it's describe an entire world on the basis of a few words.

The Last of Us by Bruce Banner and Samus Aran

I'm trying to decide a plot to go with this one, but it should probably be a little different than the rest.

A group of hunters, survivors and mercenaries have all found themselves dead or missing because their weapons are too powerful to be hidden by people who have had nothing to do with their deaths. In their attempt to survive, they come into contact with a group of scientists who work on immortality.

The scientists want both hunters and people without abilities (e.g. mutants) to join them. Since the hunters are humans, the Hunters decide not to join, which leads to a power struggle.

What I want:

Another zombie-based world, because that's what I do best, and my favorite subject. _____________________ I've read several books on this topic already, but the general consensus is that it works best as a trilogy, and the rest of the
