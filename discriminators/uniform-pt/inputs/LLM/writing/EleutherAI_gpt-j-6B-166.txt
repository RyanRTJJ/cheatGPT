It's a fine line between late and on time. You have no clue how your friends keep on getting to work on time but when you hit the streets of LA, you're not budging an edge. You're already 20 minutes late and you can already feel a few heads turning. You roll with it but there are plenty of eyes on you.
You are getting frustrated and looking around ready to say this is it, no more. You're in the car about to call someone up to jump you to work when the phone rings. A good luck message to break the drought of being so late.
It's your friend, his voicemail is on and he wants you to call ASAP. You put your phone on your lap and look at your watch, 2 minutes left.
The cell phone on your lap rings. Its your boss. You are to be in 20 minutes. Do you pick up? You have always been punctual and you need to be here in 20 minutes. Why did he wait 15 minutes to give you you the ultimatum. A good two to three days without coming into work is unheard of. You really need to know your manager and this time the boss doesn't sound happy.
You decide to call your friends to get some help. They get you through and in the next couple of minutes its clear you have a few people mad at you.
It's 3 minutes and the door to the building is about to open. You rush to get out of the car. You don't want to be late, you walk briskly in the door. As the doors shut, its clear two of your friends don't want you as a friend or even a mate.
In 6 minutes, you are back in the car and on the way to where you are going.
