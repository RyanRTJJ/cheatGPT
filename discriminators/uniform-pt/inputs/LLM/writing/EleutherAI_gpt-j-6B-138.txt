The stories were all awesome! So awesome! And if the prompts for the next day all have stars in them, we should do that again :) I hope all of you enjoyed playing around with the stars. I have attached a slideshow for the Starry Sky Day.

I tried to make this process as easy as possible. Click the next arrow in the slideshow, or click any of the images in the slideshow. The slideshow will advance automatically. When you are done with the slideshow, just press the little play button in the middle of it to play the slideshow again, or just click this link if you want to jump to a specific story.

I hope you enjoyed creating these amazing stories. Thank you again to all of my readers for participating in this creative challenge.

Previous StoryChallenge Prompt: Do you like the sky at night? This challenge was to create your dream night sky - the kind of sky you see in movies.

To the left is an excerpt from a wonderful story that was created under this challenge. The story is about a boy and his dream night sky.

For the second prompt, here is a photo of what that night sky looked like. You are free to imagine the sky.

Here is a slideshow of the photos of the sky and night.

The story was the best story I had read to that point of the challenge. And it was funny - so funny!! I found it really interesting to see how people described night skies they had seen in their lives and imagination. And, it was really clear that people understood how much it is easy to get lost without looking up.
