  Please include: How it would change the world, the consequences of it, how you’d feel, if you survived it, or how you’d react.   And the reason why the prompt gives this much of an opportunity is simply because I love the feeling of that sort of power fantasy.
Yes!!! Please write this.
I second this, please write this. I love stories where the protagonist has a second chance at a life-changing situation and makes the best of it. This can also be a very cathartic experience for people who have lost or are still suffering from that situation. It’s also very interesting to see how these sorts of situations can be viewed differently in different cultures!
I love this idea too. I could tell a story based on it but not much backstory.
It doesn’t have to have a massive backstory if that’s not what you want. It also doesn’t have to be very descriptive but a brief description of how it changed your life would be really nice.
Ok, I’ll write it up. Thanks a million.
I'd love to read it :) I'm in a rough place too and I know how much it helps to feel that your not alone in feeling the way you do.
I wrote it and posted it on r/nosleep.
Great! I'll go read it after I'm off work. Thank you!
Did you write it for me? I don’t have internet right now. But I posted it there.
Sorry, forgot I posted this. Yes, i'd be happy to read it. I think i'll write a little bit on this thread and message you when I post there. Maybe I could post it both places to give it the widest audience possible.
Cool i’ll check back there tomorrow
