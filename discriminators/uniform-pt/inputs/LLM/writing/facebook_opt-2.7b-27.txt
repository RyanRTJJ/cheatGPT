  Then Google reveals the real truth...  I'll do this and post it soon.
> a Google Street View car driver goes through a new area, only for very strange things to happen around them through the entire route.   This sounds interesting :) I mean that would need a lot of research for sure.
It requires a little bit of thought, but it would be a very good premise to get an intriguing story. It's a neat world because it's one of the things Google doesn't make available but it is still common enough to be talked about and so forth. This kind of thing I believe would need to be more than just an image, too.
I agree with you. Just that there was some pretty crazy shit that has happen to that car. I would love to learn more about it. Maybe even see pictures haha
I would certainly want to see pictures, too. How cool would it be that they were real people? Not some random camera person's idea of what they would be like.
Yup.  That would be amazing.  I have nothing to do today though, but I could look into it, figure out how to take pictures.  Then make a post about it and wait for responses.  Could you imagine the world going nuts over street view?  What a cool time to be alive.
That would be cool. That'd also make for cool internet discussion topics
If the internet is any indication:  People would not discuss that.  Most would be "this shit is insane."  But I think with the current state of humanity (internet, social media...) everyone would be fascinated by it.
Not in general, but definitely here in Reddit. If I could post pictures from the car's view I almost think that I could
