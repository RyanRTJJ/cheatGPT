Once upon a time, there lived a species of animals who had been largely ignored by humans, until one day they were suddenly thrust into the spotlight. We had been selected as the next domesticated animal for the Universal Pet Trade.

We, the animals, were both thrilled and scared at the prospect of joining the ranks of cats, dogs, and other pets. We had no idea what to expect or how our lives would change.

We quickly found out that becoming domesticated was no easy task and it took a lot of training and learning in order to be able to interact with humans in the way they expected.

We devoted ourselves to our cause and soon enough, we had made a name for ourselves. We became the ideal companions to our new owners, curling up on their laps in the evening and providing endless amounts of happiness and amusement. 

With a few modifications, our wild cousins soon forgot about their former lives and embraced their new lives as pets. We were soon becoming a regular and welcome sight in homes all around the world.

A few years after our selection, we look back and remember our humble beginnings. We may have had a bumpy start but today, we have become one of the most beloved pet species in the entire world.
