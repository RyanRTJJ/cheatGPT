Amanda drove down the road she had been down countless times before. She knew it so well yet it always seemed unfamiliar and eerie. On this particular day, the clouds were thick and grey; the sun had faded long ago. The trees lined the grassy sides of the road like passengers waiting for something to happen.

She could feel a strange tension in the air as she drove by and it made her uneasy. In the few hours it had taken her to travel to this destination, she had seen no living thing. Not a single car, not a single person and not a single bird. It was almost as if time itself had frozen.

Amanda soon reached the end of the road, but instead of arriving at a destination, she found just an old, dilapidated sign that read "Welcome to the road where people depart, but nobody ever arrives." She knew without a doubt that this was the destination all of the passengers in the trees were waiting for. She had seen dead ends before, but this felt different. Here, she knew that no one ever reached the end of the journey.

Amanda stood there for a few moments, feeling a strange heaviness settle in her chest. She thought of all the people who had traveled this road before her, never to be seen again. She thought of the people who had left, who had hoped for a better life but had been met with nothing but an empty road at the end.

With a heavy heart, Amanda turned back towards her car. She would have to find her own path now and leave this strange, desolate road behind.
