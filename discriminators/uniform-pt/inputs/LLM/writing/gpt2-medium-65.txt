This is the story from the book "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", a short story by J.K. Rowling (1886-1953).

The main characters are:

Tom Riddle, "Pretender", Slytherin Gryffindor,

Curious what the boy who thought he was Voldemort had been able to achieve on his own. That said, he has done wonderful magic as a result

Voldemort (He is the dark wizard; and is now his halfblood), a dark half-blood who once ruled the world...He who is all-powerful, the strongest of the Dark Lord.

As the reader, you'll be able to see that they both don't exactly follow simple script.


The story begins with a single word, Harry. The rest is pretty much set up for the chapter that follows, and the story takes on even greater importance when it does.

I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, and the two characters introduced thus far by the series are Harry and Hermione, who is the character who we know to us personally from "A Scandal in Belgravia" (as well as from all the movies and TV that have followed).

Of course, as with the movies, the writing style and storytelling style are quite different.

Since this story is based around a very young chapter, I will probably spoil a few good things as the story unfolds.

There's no set cut-off point at which I'll start writing the story-line for this one, and it will be a rather lengthy adventure that I'm sure will grow on you even if the chapters themselves are not too good at describing itself. Don't worry though; I should get there eventually.


The next book

I would say that it really would be the two books of the series, that are almost completely forgotten to this day. The original edition, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", was a huge success, and there were also sequels, some of
