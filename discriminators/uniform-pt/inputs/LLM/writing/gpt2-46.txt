--------------------------- Write an illustration that highlights the objects within the text. --------------------------- Copy this text and this content. -------------------------- Choose a sentence to explain how the sentences should begin. --------------------------- Write a short description of where each character has been. -------------------------- Write an illustration showing where the characters come from (or where the character isn't shown). ------------------------- Choose the sentence to explain why you think certain things are important: Your thoughts might point toward particular parts of a character, or someone important that you don't know. --------------------------- Pick a sentence that tells a similar amount of a story, without a very specific title. You could use this as a prologue.

You see, we're also writing up story ideas, so we can take ideas from our current environment and build them in. This is a quick way to get to know our world, and what's important to us, a little. I'd love to hear what you think, and how we've progressed, or even if you are interested in this or any of our things. I do like to do my part to help other designers see the world through and look at issues from the perspective of others.

For this project I would like to thank you for your time (thank you so much for your consideration,) this could be a one of a kind opportunity. It would be nice to have some interesting stuff get translated into the next language I design, or into another language I design, or into the future. Until then we thank you very much for making this program so incredibly useful for the future.

I look forward to hearing you all your feedback. I'd love to hear your side of the story if you would like to hear some other things that you'd like me to see. See you in the year 2350,

--Mark
