I just don't have an excuse as to why. I like writing about stuff that you might not understand, and have a lot of patience with my characters. I also love that I don't have to try and give you a "reason" as to why I put them in the plot. It's like when I told you that I was going to go see a movie in the evening. You're going to have that same sort of look when I tell you I'm going to put a book in your hands. You don't have to put up with it – as long as I like you, I mean.
