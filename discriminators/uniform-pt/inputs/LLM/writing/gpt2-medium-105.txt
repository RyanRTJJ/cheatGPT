 No one can go on their planet without permission.  But when I'm going to leave my planet for a job, I must have permission.  How can I even get the permissions required, if this place is so unsafe?  No one knows, until I go back to investigate."

I remember reading in one of the earliest science fiction stories something along the lines of "One's body is a mirror to her self," and it just gave me goose bumps!

I know that the "Sol" and the "Biohazard Zone" are two different names for your planet's biospheres and biological regions, but that is actually not relevant. The issue here is that no one, including you, ever knows what biospheres and biological regions look like. A lot of you will disagree with me, but maybe you should try trying to imagine yourself in those kinds of "biosphere" and "biological region" states instead of living in your head. If anyone asks you this question, please keep the details short and to the point. Delete
There's nothing to hide, I find you have some fairly sophisticated mind tricks already. They aren't really mind tricks, they're ways of getting things done that will confuse me even more. Delete
I think I just answered everything! I've always found that you can't escape responsibility. Reply Delete
It says in the book that the "Sol" had been discovered on the surface of the planet (with the sun) as of 10,000 years ago or later. The Sol is a term for a planet having an asteroid belt between Earth and Mars, that the asteroid belt actually intersects Mars and Jupiter at a height of at least 2,500 miles or roughly 3,700 km.
