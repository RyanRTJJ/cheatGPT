It was a custom that had been passed down from generation to generation - everyone dies on their birthday. Although it was widely accepted as fact, no one knew when it would occur. Some were fortunate enough to live long lives, while others were taken at a young age.

The people in the village were careful to celebrate lives, rather than mourn deaths. On any given birthdate, a grand celebration was held for the person whose life had ended the previous year. This demonstrated the customs of their land - to respect and commemorate all life, no matter its length.

The day of one's birth was a special day for everyone celebrated or mourned. The entire town would gather to give their respects, and a large feast was always prepared. People would tell stories of the deceased and laugh, cry, and share memories.

Although death was inevitable, the people of the village never knew who, or when, it would take someone. They also knew it was completely out of their control, so they accepted and embraced it. The knowledge did not waiver the villagersâ€™ love for life, but rather made them appreciate every moment of it even more. The darkness of mortality only served to highlight the beauty of living.
