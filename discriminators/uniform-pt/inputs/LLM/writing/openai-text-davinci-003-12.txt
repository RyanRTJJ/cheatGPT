I was walking home late one night from a friend's house, alone as usual. Since I had my headphones on, I didn't hear the footsteps coming up behind me until it was too late. I tried to run, but before I could, I felt a cold hand clamp over my mouth and I was thrown to the ground. 

I saw two figures standing in front of me, one holding a gun. They had their hoods up, so I couldn't make out any of their features. I saw the one with the gun reach into my pocket and take my wallet and phone. I started to scream and the one with the gun quickly put their finger to their lips to tell me to stay quiet. 

They backed away slowly, leaving me trembling on the sidewalk. I lay there, helpless and vulnerable, until I finally mustered the courage to get up and run the rest of the way home. My hands were shaking and my heart was pounding all the way there. 

When I got home, I went straight to my bedroom and locked the door behind me. I was so shaken up and scared. I couldn't believe what had just happened. 

Before the robbery, I had been walking around freely without a care in the world, but afterwards I was constantly looking over my shoulder. That night changed my life and made me extra cautious of my surroundings.
