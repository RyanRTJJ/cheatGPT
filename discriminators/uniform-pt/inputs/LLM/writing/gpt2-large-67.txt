 In this scenario, someone just blurts out "Look! No one's watching!" and the camera doesn't turn to look. In addition to the prompt, you can use this question as the main question. Answer that question with either your name or a photo of yourself. If you're answering with your name, write it in the first item in the photo list.

For example, you could use it to create a blog post describing what you think about when you look at the sun at night. When you're done, take a small photo of your drawings and stick it on your whiteboard, where it will be easily accessible. If you don't take your photos, the rest of the story can be completely self-contained without making you look like an amateur. If you take your photos, make sure your audience is not looking directly at the photos—this does not count as being able to "see" you as a writer. When you're done, use the whiteboard to draw another drawing on that whiteboard. Include a statement in parentheses, explaining why you drew the drawing. Now return to the whiteboard where you took your previous drawing—take another picture of it. Then draw the next drawing and keep repeating the
