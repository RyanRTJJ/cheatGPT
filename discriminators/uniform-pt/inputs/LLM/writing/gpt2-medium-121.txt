________________________ * The words, "Ruler of all, be it dead or alive?" were inspired by a line in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. While I was writing the song, my daughter and I were chatting over lunch, so I started reading Shakespeare's "Macbeth," to be funny and interesting. She was pretty amused. The line, "O thou good, faithful King of England," was actually drawn by Sir Walter Scott, in reference to King Edward III's death for refusing to swear allegiance to England, the royal capital of England. Scott wrote the last four lines of the tale without any notes, and I have never read Shakespeare's version, so he was kind enough to let me quote the lines, and I thought, "Oh, well, who could it possibly be?" The word "madrid" comes from the Spanish word madra, meaning "fool's paradise." In Latin, MAD has been translated in English as "wealth," but as I was writing the lyrics I was thinking "Madrid! What a strange city! It has been created by the rich from what little they have and that it has been created from rich is madness." My lyrics say: Let the richest find glory and wealth if they wish to. Let the rich find glory and fortune that may well give them, or all that is needed. But let them not seek. Let them not seek. For they have not yet found the land of their needs. And how do we know? We are in that land. And the city of that city is MADART, which means, of course, "City of Wealth." If you're familiar with this word and can tell a few more things about MADART, please don't hesitate to ask me! I'm interested.
