I don't know what the last twenty years have in store for me, except I am going to be a lot smarter about my life than I was before.


-Benjamin Franklin I know this is my last story for this prompt, but because I'm leaving as soon as possible, I hope I have a nice long one to go out on! To all you fans of the S&S:W books, I can't thank you enough. You really make my life worth living.


I'm hoping to make my final post about one or two chapters away from what would be my final S&S:W novel. For all of you who are wondering about my thoughts on "The Time Machine," well, I don't have a lot more to say. For now.


To my fellow S&S author, fans, friends, family, bloggers, and anyone else who thinks of me as a "fan," you know my answer to that is:

Whoa... what? I'm sorry, folks. But I can't stop now. I will never, ever stop. I have to finish S&S:W!

Now, there is still a chance that I could finish S&S:W. That's why I did some consulting in my spare time recently on the sequel to "The Time Machine," "The Return." That means that I could finish the sequel to one of the best-selling sci-fi novels of the last decade! But you know what? I've been working on another sci-fi novel and a few other non-fiction books that are much further along. So in the interim, I'm writing a bit for you guys. I hope you enjoy it. Last edit: 3/6/16 - Added links to a few more links about the sequel to "The Time Machine." For those of you who still love S&S:W, I hope you appreciate their contributions to the future!
