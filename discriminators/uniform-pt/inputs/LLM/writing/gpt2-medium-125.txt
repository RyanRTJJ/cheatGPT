 You turn to your TV, but realize that your show isn't running properly.  The network wants to change the time.  The show needs to continue on, but you're having trouble getting through to the time machine.  You decide to call up God.
For example: How would you handle this if Heaven asked you to watch a movie?
God answers:  (I'm not here to judge, I'm just following you.) "I'll keep this a secret. I'd go to a private church and pray the whole time."
I'm pretty sure you can handle this, but I'd love if God was your friend.  I'm pretty sure everyone who's heard God's words on Earth does feel God's love toward them once something positive happens in their lives.  What if those people, the Christians, suddenly had to live with God? What if they could never see God again and could never say his name, ever again?  What if it was forever?  It's about accepting God and not judging him either.  
"What if the other stuff doesn't work either for you?"  If the people of Heaven say they can hear God's words when they're on vacation in Hawaii, God wonders how many people would even be listening to God's name anymore if he had to say it a hundred times a day.  "I'd say it's a pretty good use of my time."
That's right. I don't blame God for saying "I'll keep this a secret." I blame God for letting you hear that God is God, and there's no way I'd want to live without believing God exists.   When we become aware of God's words, we are led by his voice to turn away from pride and love, and to see that we could be even grander, even better, even more extraordinary
