How about

The Death of Art

?

A:

It could be a

 Death of a Salesman with Willy going berserk at the end.

We have a wish (willy) and a sigil (death)

The "sigil" is the image that Willy is drawing to fulfill his wish.

 

The wish is a person - his wife.

Willy has a vision of his wife at the end. It is his "death" but Willy is a character who just isn't very practical.  This image is a symbol for his death.

The story is told by a salesperson (Willy) and the art is the end of his career.

 

The last stage is  of Willy's artistic career (the art)  

The ending of the story is a final painting (death).

 The story ends in a very tragic manner, but the final image of the artist tells of his life of tragedy and how much he loved his wife. She goes on with another man and Willy has no contact with her.

The art shows the love they shared.

The art shows that he loved his wife. The lines are filled with heart shapes. All the objects that Willy used to create his art are painted with heart shapes. They represent the heart he has for his wife.

 

 

 

 

 

A:

It is a simple

 picture of a man crying:

A sigil is a

symbol that is to bring about something

wishes, prayers, desires.

A sigil can be 

 a picture, a song, a drawing, or a sign.

Thus we see that

 all the things that we see in the question are sigils.
