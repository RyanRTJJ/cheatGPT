Kathy was travelling back home to Newark to visit her family after a long vacation. She was dozing off in her first class window seat when she was jarred awake by the sound of a man's voice directly next to her. She opened her eyes to see a tall, wiry-looking stranger leaning towards her. With a sense of dread, she saw that he was staring intensely into her eyes and said, "Don't ask me how I know this, but this plane is going to crash before it reaches Newark."

Kathy felt like her heart was going to jump out of her chest and her mind raced as she tried to process this seemingly impossible situation. Was this man serious? She had to be sure, but she didn't want to alarm the other passengers, so she simply asked the man why he believed this.

The man said he had been having visions of impending disaster, and he was certain that this was going to happen. He insisted that it was not a joke, but deadly serious.

Kathy shook her head in disbelief, but decided to act. She quickly called the flight attendant and requested to be moved away from the man. She then discretely spread the word among herself and the other passengers, making sure to keep her voice low to not cause a panic.

Once the plane had safely landed in Newark, Kathy was eager to talk to the authorities, but the strange man had disappeared in the confusion. Kathy could only hope that his dire warning had not been true.
