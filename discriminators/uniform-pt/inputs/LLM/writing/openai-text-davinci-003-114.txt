The sun was setting on what felt like the hundredth day of being alone. I had been holed up in an old building, with a large radio tower standing tall beside it, hoping to reach someone out there in the world, who like me was still alive. I had been broadcasting my distress call every day, pleading for survivors to come to me. I had also been sharing stories, anecdotes of my day to day, reminiscing about the way the world used to be.

But the majority of the time, there was just silence. Nobody had answered, nobody had come. I had brought some supplies with me when I had first arrived, but now, as the setting sun signaled the end of another day in the post-apocalyptic wasteland, I knew I only had a few days left of food, water, and shelter.

I decided to use my last bit of energy to make one last broadcast. I laid out my plan to the world, begging anyone to find me before I ran out of strength. I described where I was located, the building and tower, and hoped that it would be enough that someone would find me.

The sun was waning and the sky was darkening as I switched off the transmitter. I knew that nobody would be coming, but I clung to a small bit of hope that maybe, just maybe, somewhere out there, somebody was listening.
