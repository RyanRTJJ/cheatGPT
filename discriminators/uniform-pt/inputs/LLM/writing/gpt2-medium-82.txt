You'll have to use them or drop them as soon as you get into trouble... There are 4 chests with various loot in them ranging from items to Armor. There are 7 chests with a total loot of around 5000 gil. Head into the Central Cathedral in the second hall to find Walter - who has a fairly easy time of it. He's in his house on the upper floor of the Cathedral, and as soon as you enter, give him a drink and you should be good. This fight will probably cause you to lose some Stamina, though you might be able to restore some. He raises his HP as he does battle, but like with most demons the better to heal. You can inflict Damage and status effects on him when you're low on damage, just be careful when he takes damage. His defense makes him somewhat difficult, though. He'll take 2 MP whenever he uses a Special Status. With a high chance of Status, inflict status, and inflict it again, this time on all of your characters. He will use Fire at some point, but if you manage to pull him down enough with spells and lots of magic, he will drop a Holy Water Shard.
