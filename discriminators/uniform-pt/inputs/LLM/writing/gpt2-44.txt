 The bus stand is full of people.  Do not go there.  Don't bring your shoes.  Don't take any pictures and don't be in the exact right place.  Take a walk or take a hike.  Don't get caught up in the moment.  Don't take anything out of the photo or put it on your windshield.  If the bus stop is too close, we're not going to call it a stop, but make sure to put a lot of pressure on it.  This is a safety hazard when something breaks in our driveway, you can't really get in here right now.
This is a fun day, be sure to take it with you.  Don't forget that you are able to ride your bike into the busy parking lot (if you look at the right side, you'll see that there is no crosswalk to get into, so be sure to avoid the big blue crosswalk at the top of the right-hand curb, and use the left-hand ramp just over there).
Once home, pick up the laptop and use it to open the back door, this time for the light.
I guess our house is always an emergency situation with us, I've been on two very active bus rides in the last couple days.  I have the most recent bus, there was only one bus stop to the right.  It turned into a street and then a big parking lot as I headed out to the side streets.  No safety concerns aside from the back door, there's no other options.  As you can imagine, the house was a nightmare for me when first getting into the neighborhood. The road around the house just gets blocked out.  It was pretty scary to walk up to my window and see all these people coming in and out of the house without any warning like the people coming in.
I was really lucky to not have the opportunity to see my friends and neighbors, it really did suck seeing the people there.  I knew there was no one else there.
All in all, the experience for me wasn't
