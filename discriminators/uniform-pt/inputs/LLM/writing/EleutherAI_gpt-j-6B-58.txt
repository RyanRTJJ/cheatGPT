How did this story start?

This story started while I was on vacation in Texas in early January. While waiting in line to have my breakfast, I heard a man complaining that his wife had been a very good friend of his until she suddenly stopped returning his calls. As I overheard their conversation, my heart was aching for his loss, but as he continued to complain, my heart turned to despair. I looked down to where his coffee was standing on the counter. "Have you talked to her lately?" I asked.   
"Yes, right before she walked out on me." My heart sank and I felt like crying. Suddenly, a voice came on and announced an update to an emergency evacuation order on a nearby island. The evacuation was mandatory, effective immediately, regardless of the state of the storm. I felt that God was speaking to me through this stranger's pain. Even as I listened to the weather report, I silently said the Lord's Prayer as this man and I wept together. On the way back home, as I reflected on what I had heard, I realized that I had been there. I had been that woman.
