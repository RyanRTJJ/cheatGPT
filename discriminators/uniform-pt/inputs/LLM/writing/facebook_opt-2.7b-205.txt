 EDIT: And use your brain here, think a bit. Maybe it's the author lying? Does one character seem shifty as to their veracity?  EDIT 2: Actually, no. It's not the author. Use your brain.
I like this idea a lot, thank you! I'll look for some good prompts.
You might write a detective story. You have to figure out what the detective knows is a lie.
Wouldn't that be an investigation?
Yeah, maybe it would. But what if the liar is the author? What if the police have been tricked into arresting the liar? What if *everyone* knows that the detective is wrong?
Oh my god, there are infinite ways to write that, I would *love* to write something like that.
You may not like the end results, though.
Just make sure you don't kill off your hero. At the very least I want to see him get the girl/woman.
Yeah. You'd need some kind of cliffhanger. There hasn't really been one in a while.
There is one in the Dresden Files, where the author kills off, *then* reinstalls him, giving the reader the choice to either reaccept him or not. It was really effective in my opinion.
Huh, I thought that's what Harry Dresden himself was referring to, but apparently I don't know my Dresden. I'll take a look at it. Thanks!
Yeah the series is awesome from what I've read. He's a bit of a self-righteous dick sometimes, but I like his attitude.
Yeah, I read a bit of the first book a couple of years ago, but never picked it up again. They keep getting more and more popular, I was going to eventually read it again, so thanks for telling me about them! :D
