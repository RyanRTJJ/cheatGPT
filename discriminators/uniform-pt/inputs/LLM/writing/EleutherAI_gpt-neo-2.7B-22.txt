I've been living with some sort of a secret. I don't know what it is, except my house is a mess. I have never thrown anything away in my entire life, and I can't explain why, but it all disappears when I'm at my parents' place. I used to hate them when the secret came out; now I don't really care. I only have to go there on short holidays, or when I feel like killing myself. 

So I decided to go there today. When I got home, there was no note that read, This is not home. I was quite surprised to find a note posted on the door telling me that my parents had been gone for the whole month.

A possible answer would be

 The Secret Place is a home in the book:

This isn't home, but it'll do
  It'll have to do until it's finished

So it's a place

 In the book the Secret Place is referred to as:

 That's where we hide everything that 
     we don't want our parents or
     teachers to see. It is a secret,
  quite a big secret, and no one would
     find us if we did not want
     them to find us.

 Or at least, the people who live there

 Have no reason to be there, and no
 one would expect to see them there

 By this book the Secret Place is actually

 Home the whole time, it just looks like
      everything is wrong and is not, 
  and no one knows even what it is. 

 Which would make its name

 Not Secret, it's Home, but one that needs to be hidden. 

 If I say that everything goes 
      to the Secret Place, that is 
      true. It stays at home. 
  But the children need not tell 
      their parents that everything
