 You know what happens next.
i like that idea. i'll see if i can put something together.
It will be a tragic tale for the ages.  The fire will begin when he arrives at the flower shop, where he will pick a bouquet of fresh flowers, orchids perhaps.
i was thinking about the fact that he's going to burn their love alive in the flames of passion.
That too.  It will be a classic tale of loss and love lost, written as he walks the city streets of the cityscape.   He will be a knight on that journey, on his way to battle against the evil who seeks to destroy what he holds so dear to him.  He will be a hero.  But the evil will get him when he is weakest.
and the fact that the shopkeeper of the shop that he'll go to will be a woman who will do anything to prevent that evil from happening to love or her shop.
The female will fight with a sword and her life.  She will die in her quest and he will save her at the last.  Her body will be charred beyond recognition.  He'll see this body and it will be his reason for continuing down this journey.  In remembrance of his love.
i was thinking maybe there will be a small child that dies in the fire while the flower shop keeper sits in his grief.
Perhaps the child will survive, but the old woman will perish in the flames.  Her soul will remain, however, and burn forever in the ashes she's left behind.  The child will look through the charred remains of her home, and she will remember, and the only thing she will have will be a memory.
i like that idea a lot.  i wonder if i should start out with a story like that, or if i should begin with a new one?
I think that is a good starting place.  You could probably write a better story in a couple days of writing
