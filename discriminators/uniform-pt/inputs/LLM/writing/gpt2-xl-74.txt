------------ And in the end, who cares about a new character if they're just going to be some one-off, and you might be tired of reading about them? That's ok though. The story is almost over, even if you decide to write your own. I suggest you save it in an EPUB or MOBI container like I did for Chapter 4 of the Aesthetics of the Dead series (I think), and then you can go back to it when you're done with reading the trilogy. I'd prefer to do a short story with the character. It'll be a fun experience for you, and a fun experience for me. I hope you enjoyed this blog entry. If you have any ideas for me or this series (like any of the characters), please let me know in the comments, and I'd love to hear what you think. Thanks! -W.P. ------------- Thanks to my wonderful beta, K. S. ------------- Thank you, K. S. for your help in betaing this entry.

Disclaimer: None of the characters or settings in any of the Harry Potter books belong to me, J.K. Rowling, or Warner Bros. Inc., although she did give me permission to post these, and I am working on a number of my own stories, mainly for adults. I own nothing else. I'm just doing it to amuse myself. Also, I hope this blog entry was entertaining! If you think it wasn't, maybe you should try reading up on the plot and characters from the first four Harry Potter novels, which is a little more difficult. I'd love to hear
