How do you know the difference between shifters who are blood relation or are cousins? Do you ask the shifter or someone in his family if you can meet? Do you take a shower to wash the smell of him off you before you meet? Is he allowed to see you or just your reflection in the mirror with a glamour spell to make yourself look like him? 
Is there a way to tell if a shifter is a blood relation of yours without asking? If he is, can you get a glimpse of his sibling in the same way as you do other family members if they share the same family tree?

  Shun: “I am a man. I can do what I want.-
  Sapient: “You think I wanted to be a human?”-

If a blood relation or blood heir is an extended family member, they can meet a person without that person seeing it.
