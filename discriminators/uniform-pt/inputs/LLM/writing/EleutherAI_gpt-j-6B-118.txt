I'm not quite sure how you write down something with no words
   that still can be read by a person though.

This one is easy:

1. 2. 3. 4.

Is there some form of cipher here?

Is there some form of cipher here?

 This might involve

 writing in different languages to a specific meaning ("what the fuck is that even trying to say??!")

If we had words for the things in this sentence (ie if we said them out loud or mentally),

 we could infer meaning from context, ie, the sentence would probably have been "It seems as though I'm writing down something that's saying this". 

If we had a cipher,

 it'd go "CK3J4CK" (which, after decoding, is something like this:  There once was a boy called Jack, who loved to play with a block of Cheddar, that got coddled on a farm, to the point where he turned blue (I think, it's been a while since I read that).  Then the sky turned purple.  What a weirdo.)

How about...

 I'm not quite sure how you read without words. This is a literal interpretation (and probably is the meaning in the context of the prompt).

 This can be decoded back into "K3J4CK". This can be read either backwards or forwards. Thus, it's a literal interpretation (in reverse) and could be read forward as what the asker of the prompt is really asking, too. I'll let you read it backwards. (There once was a boy called Jack, who loved to play with a block of Cheddar...)
