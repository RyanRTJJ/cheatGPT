Dear [Recipient],

I hope this letter finds you happy and fulfilled. I'm writing it because I wanted to tell you something that I never had the confidence or courage to say to you before.

You have been a shining light in my life since the moment I first met you. You always had a way of making me feel as if everything was possible, no matter how hard things seemed. When I was at my lowest points in life and thought that there was no hope, you were always there to help me believe in myself and to see past the darkness. You were the one that showed me that I could be more than what I thought I was capable of.

As I reflect on all the moments we've had together, it's hard not to wonder "what if?" What if I had been able to tell you how much I appreciated your friendship, how I looked up to you and looked forward to our conversations? What if I had been brave enough to tell you how much I admired you for your strength and courage?

Though I can't go back in time and change what has already happened, I wanted to take this opportunity to express how much your presence in my life has meant to me. Every moment with you is a moment I cherish, and I just wanted to express my gratitude for your friendship and the guidance you have given me, both in the past and present.

With appreciation,

[Your Name]
