I had been alive for what felt like eternity. I had seen and experienced far more than any normal human being should over the course of their life, and yet here I still was – forever living, unable to move on. This was the life of being functionally immortal, and at times it was too much to bear.

So I decided to turn death into a game for myself. I had already died countless times, but each time I always came back, unharmed and perfectly healthy. But I was still searching for the ultimate thrill and I had found it – my most elaborate, daring death yet. 

My plan was to jump off of a skyscraper in the heart of the city, with no protection or help in sight – it was a death that had never before been attempted and would be impossible to pull off without my immortality. As I took a deep breath and looked down at the streets below, my heart was pounding with excitement and anticipation as I thought of what I was about to do. 

I stepped forward and made the plunge. Whether I made it or not, the adrenaline rush I was feeling in that moment would stay with me forever, and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. I flew through the air, feeling small and insignificant and yet, so alive. 

It was a split second later that I felt the impact and knew it was all over. Death had come and gone again, but the memory of this final rush was one that would never leave me.
