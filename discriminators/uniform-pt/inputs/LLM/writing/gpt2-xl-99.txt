_____________________________________________ If you're looking for inspiration on what kind of story to tell, a group of kids who are into horror might love the idea of the "Griffon Rider" story. It's about a girl named Jessica who is killed by a man who breaks into her house and kills all of her family before shooting her as the lights go out. The man kills her grandparents before committing suicide. Eventually an officer comes and arrests him for the murder. At the end of each house he comes across, a man and woman come for him. The first woman wants to know what happened to Jessica (she is being blamed for the death of the family). He says she might be the Grim Reaper in the story. The second woman asks why this man, who has murdered so many people, didn't just end his own life. Jessica says it's because of his daughter. He says it's because he's not ready to die. The story ends with the Grim Reaper telling the girl a poem from a storybook. -D

It ended with the man trying to escape and she was the closest thing he was really going to find. However just as she was about to cut his hand off, he found
