And, if you want to keep your game alive, the free game (the current "free" edition) can still be downloaded for Windows (no DRM) if you don't mind a few extra bucks. But don't mention that!

The King's Tale

by George RR Martin. No age restrictions, all characters derived from George RR Martin.

A Song of Ice and Fire fanfic that takes place in King's Landing.

You know, even the bastard wouldn't know it, but I'm always telling the good guys I'm the one who's going to be the fucking president if there's one. We're a nation of fools. The worst thing we can do is to take that stand. We cannot let this nation fall back into old-fashioned tribalism. George.

Mystery has it that I was killed in the Wall

at some unknown moment

In the night while trying to make a move on your King.


How did you survive his attack

After your friend was killed by his bastard?

How could you flee?

And then, how was your friend found and how did you discover him?

It's a mystery of many, many details, this one I cannot put words to, but it could not be hidden,

I will answer it: I made it out of the Wall.

The Snow King

by George RR Martin. I am the Snow King. I am still your king. I am a king.


I came into your court with the promise to kill you in one swift blow. It took me days to think about it, too many details to count. But once it all hit me like a ton of bricks, I knew. I became king like the rest of you did. It's no different at all. No one is free. It's all my responsibility to give the truth to the world that this isn't about your rights or justice or honour. No,
