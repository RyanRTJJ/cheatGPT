 My dad died a handful of years ago and I have kept some stuff from him but wouldn't really call it a letter. My dream to write a book on his life and his life after he died was broken and has never gotten back to that spot.
I'd be interested in seeing what you come up with. I know this sort of thing is hard to do but just try. Let people look at it if they want to critique it. Just get your idea out so that if it isn't done, you can at least try again. You never know. It could be the best thing you've written. Not just that, anything, we're all trying to take chances in the world and put something out that isn't totally expected of us.
Thanks! I will. I've been keeping journals here and there. Just never had it quite write about my parents. I was probably thinking way too hard when it came to it.
I think that's fair. When I first started writing, I would keep a journal of my experiences with my past relationships and experiences as well, but it just wasn't as fun for me. I felt like any problems with them were just a step above every other problem I could say that way (I had issues), and I just felt unapproachable and unattractive to even people I didn't want to be around. This led me to just keeping all of it to myself.
I get it. I feel like I don't see it, but when someone has an issue I think I'm really understanding because I really know how hard it is even to have good relationships sometimes. It's not something I'm really comfortable writing about, but it's something I've tried.
I'm glad I could help even a little bit if I could be of any assistance!
