How about this one:
A woman has been married for over a year to a very, very good, caring, wealthy man. No one ever knows he's a thief, she's never had her money stolen before and even if she did, this would never happen to her. All of a sudden an old thief hands her a note. She reads it and is shocked:
"Dear Janey, 
Thanks for the gift (the money, the car, it's not important what it is really). Yours, your Uncle Henry"
She's just gotten married and this is the first theft she's had. She rushes home as fast as she can in the new car she just bought, and as she gets closer she realizes she doesn't have the key to her new house. She runs up the driveway and slams the door behind her, she's home safe...but in someone else's house. She slowly walks in wondering who it could possibly be and what they want. She opens the first door she comes to and it's a bathroom. She starts thinking maybe it has something to do with this room, but she quickly remembers the wedding and goes back in to her bedroom where she realizes that everything is as it should be. She realizes it's her new house now and goes to bed.
The next morning, she's still a little concerned. She asks her husband how he got inside the house and what he wanted. He claims he wasn't in the house at all...the money had been left on the stairs. Janey gets in the front seat of the car, opens the door on the backseat and reaches in. The note is there...it's not folded up, it's laid out. The only thing that explains why someone would leave a note after stealing a car is....well, they didn't steal the darn thing.
