 I want to use [IP] for a new type of monster-like enemy. Can you find a story/idea that involves something like this? Thanks
[m] You should make a new post with these rules and the prompt :]
Ok thanks - i will put these into new post in a minute.
Hey could you edit this post with all the new rules?
Sure, give me a minute. I'll be there in a minute and will post the new rules.  Thanks.
You're going to edit this post with new rules, correct? I'm confused if you'll be making a new one with new rules to match this prompt or not haha. Just asking to be sure.
There's no point in starting a new thread with the rules. You only change the title to "the rules for this prompt" so no one sees a big change other than "new rules" is in the title.  My rule changes are just for this specific story.
Oh okay. That makes much more sense. Thanks man!
No problem! We all learn from experience.  Thanks for understanding.
I guess I didn't understand why you were doing this. I apologize for being so confused!   Thanks again for being so patient with me. This is just my first post and my only English is coming from a class so I'm working hard to write a good first post. This sub has been so helpful that now I'm being an overly nice dick :)  You're awesome!
Nah. My bad for not explaining properly. I was starting a new thread so all the posts after mine would be on the same thread, not on a single thread.
Oh okay. That makes sense. Thank you so much! :)
No problemo!  You're welcome!
