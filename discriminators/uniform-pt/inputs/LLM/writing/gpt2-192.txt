 In other words, we are just there to share our pain.  However, it is the way we work that gets us here that makes us feel sorry for ourselves.  At times we are just the 'just' we have become, a'sarcasm' in which we no longer know what we need but what we want us to be,'more' and 'fate' in our hearts.  We are simply our true selves, even though we are still a lot closer in some parts of ourselves than our self.  Even though we may be a lot less aware of what it's like to be your own person, they are still able to hold their own.         It's something I always remember in school.  I was the child that would go to sleep at 6pm looking for a teacher that read a book and that teacher would walk in with them.  There was a story that we had written and shared.  In that story, my mother looked at the pictures and had a smile on her face.  She read to her daughter why she loved that book and the picture was just that.  I took that picture and I'm proud of that.  I learned about the difference between our selves and not all others.  If we're willing to share experiences that are not shared by others, we're more likely to share them on our own terms as well as make others feel like they're responsible to be better for themselves.  So there you have it, a story that is part of the overall story about how we become.  If you enjoyed the story then I would hope you can see that I'm working with some real people at my blog as well.  Hopefully now we can put a spotlight on those kids who are trying to become better and they're doing so well.  If you've read this then by all means use it as a source
