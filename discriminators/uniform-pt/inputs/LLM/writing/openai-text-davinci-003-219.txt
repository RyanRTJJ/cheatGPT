The wedding day was one of the most beautiful days Beth and her fiance, John, had ever seen. As they said their vows, the sun beamed down upon them, creating a magical atmosphere. 

After the ceremony, the reception began and the guests began to mingle. Beth noticed a woman she had never seen before. She was quite elegant and dressed in an exquisite dress. She made her way to Beth and John, introducing herself as a close family friend. She insisted that Beth and John had met before, but Beth was certain that she had never seen the woman before. 

Once the reception begin to wind down, Beth decided to take a closer look at the woman's identity. She found out that the woman had lied about her identity, using a fake name. Not only that, but it seemed like she was trying to get close to her and John. After some more investigating, Beth found out who the woman really was: an infamous con-artist. 

Beth was shocked and scared that this imposter had infiltrated their wedding day. Fortunately, they managed to expose her and keep her away before she could cause any more trouble. After this incident, Beth was determined to keep an eye on all of their guests, just in case.
