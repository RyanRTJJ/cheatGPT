How would you respond to:
The Grim Reaper's song,
And the sound of his voice
Shakes the land
The very air has changed
His footsteps
And the sun rises
It is a very dark time
and dark thoughts creep across her mind
She is the first person to speak to Grim Reaper. It is a very dark time and dark thoughts creep across her mind. "I am the Grim Reaper" "And you will die here today" "You are ready to die today" "You are the Grim Reaper"

How would you respond to:
The dead may look young,
Yet their hearts are the true ghastly dead
The blood has risen, their ghosts walk from their graves
The living fear the dread specter of the Grim Reaper
The eyes of the dead stare back as they hear their own screams fill the air
The soul and the spirit can no longer meet
Sorrow and the ghastly dead are always there
Sorrow and the ghastly dead are always there
- Written by: Serenity
In the dead of the night are the restless ones.
One and all turn to seek answers,
Yet they have no real way of knowing
The Grim Reaper has arrived,
A stranger, a stranger to us,
And the questions they ask
Will forever haunt us

The sound shakes the world and shakes the very air.
A woman lies in the dust, her throat torn from her by ghastly cries, as the ghoul waits on the shore. Her screams echo as one after another, all the way from the shore to her lifeless body. Her screams echo until the night wind blows the corpse apart. When she dies, the ghouls who had taken her life rise to her body and carry her spirit away.
