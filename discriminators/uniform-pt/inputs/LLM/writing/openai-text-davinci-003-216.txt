The late night trains rumbled along the tracks, shaking the platform and sending vibrations through the soles of my feet. I had stayed out far too late and decided to take the train in hopes of making it to my home before the late night darkness would wrap itself around it in a blanket.

As I walked along the tracks the wind started to pick up, the leaves rustled and swayed in a strange pattern that seemed to be following me. I could feel an eerie presence that was following closely behind, but every time I turned to look no one was there.

I eventually came upon an old factory, it seemed intimidating and unwelcoming. The walls surrounding the building were tall and rugged, and the windows were smudged and covered with dirt. I cautiously walked up to the entrance and noticed an abandoned gas can by the door.

Just as I was about to turn away, I heard a sound that made my heart drop. It was faint, but I could make out a ticking. My mind raced, trying to figure out what it was, but I pushed the thought deep down and began to walk away as quickly as I could.

Once I was far enough away from the factory, I felt the fear start to creep in. I could still hear the faint ticking, and I felt the urge to run, but it seemed like something was holding me in place. I couldn't explain it, but I was terrified of this inanimate object - a gas can that had been forgotten in an old, abandoned factory.
