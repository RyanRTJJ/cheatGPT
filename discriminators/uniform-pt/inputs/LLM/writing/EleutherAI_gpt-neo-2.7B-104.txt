 
And this only happens once. 

HAPPY THANKSGIVING! You've been a fantastic guest, and I can't think of better people to thank than the people who've helped this story along.

I'm going to make a few bold changes. Not many, but a few. I hope you'll let me know what you think! You're a writer you know.

For the story, I'm going to switch from the traditional Christmas to this week's theme of love. I'm going to change this from being about me as a single woman to focusing on my love life around the holiday. This is going to be a different love story than usual, and I hope readers will like it.

It's been amazing to me to see this year's themes for this journal of mine work. I'm amazed at the themes this journal is now writing from. Love, death, family, betrayal... These are themes I've enjoyed writing about. And a huge thanks to each and every one of you who joined me in this! It continues to be heart-breaking for me because many of my stories have taken a darker turn these past 2 months. While I'm getting ready to write these dark scenes, I can only hope that it will be the last time I'll get to write them. I'd really like to thank each and every one of you for this journal-by-journals. This is truly the most wonderful experience in each and every one. I love working with each of you, learning from every story, and feeling like this has been one of the greatest relationships I've had outside of blogging. I hope this year's journals are more of the same, and even greater.

I hope I've been your friend, and more. I hope to have the chance to talk more about writing for a bit. But I'd like to get started first!
