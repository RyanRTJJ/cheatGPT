Erica had developed a bedtime ritual over the course of years: she'd curl up in bed and read the same chapter of a book, the same chapter she'd read since the day she'd first opened it.

It was a strange custom, one that she'd developed out of boredom and curiosity when she was younger. It was an old novel, one that had been in her family for generations, and as the years passed, Erica became engrossed in it. She was a voracious reader, yet somehow, this particular chapter always drew her back in.

But Erica had been doing this for years now, and still, the same chapter remained unfinished. She had made her way through the rest of the book, but this single chapter had never ended.

She began to suspect that it never would.

The more Erica read, the more the narrator of the book seemed to be telling her something without actually saying anything. As if each sentence was leading to an inevitable conclusion, the one that could never be reached.

And so, each night, when Erica curled up in bed, she opened up the same book and read the same chapter, the one that she was beginning to suspect would never end.
