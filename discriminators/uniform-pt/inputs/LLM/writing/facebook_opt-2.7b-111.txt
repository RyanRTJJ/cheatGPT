 Make a link to it somewhere in your post. I suggest the title for the story is *Something About That Chapter*. You're welcome, everyone :)
That is actually a really good idea. I will give it a go
Thanks, I came up with it a couple days ago. I wanted a different twist than most of the other suggestions in the thread so I'm glad you enjoy it
I just found it very interesting and will be going back to read that chapter again! Thanks :)
I will be going back to read it again as well, good idea.
I am going to read it again too
I am, it is brilliant!
I've found it. Great suggestion!
You're welcome, I'm happy you enjoyed it :)
I will be going back to read it again and again.
I am going to read it again too
I went back and read it again, you were right! It's really good!
I am very glad I suggested this. Thanks
You're welcome, I'm really glad you enjoyed it :) I'm glad it didn't feel forced/obvious, I was worried the first time I said it.
I am pleased you think so. I was not sure you would. I thought it was good.
Great, I'm glad you enjoyed it :) I tried to make it feel like the book was winding down, but the reader still needs to know what happens, which you did.
I've told my wife the story too. She thought it was very good. She wasn't too sure about the suggestion of me reading that chapter again but she said she will remember to do it!
I hope you have more suggestions, I'm loving this, and how quickly you thought it was!
