The battlefield was a disaster. Smoke filled the air and bullet holes riddled the walls. Bodies lay everywhere, some from the most recent battle, others from previous battles. The war had been raged on for far too long and this particular battle was the make or break. All parties knew it and so it was all or nothing.

The timer was ticking and the enemy was quickly closing in. The odds weren't in anyone's favor.

That's when they brought out the superhuman soldiers. Their faces were emotionless and their weapons glinted with a light that seemed like a warning in itself. No one felt the need to question them; they were a joint project between several powerful nations all united against a common enemy.

The good news was that, as far as anyone knew, no one had seen them in action before. Each superhuman soldier was outfitted with a special suit which gave them enhanced strength and agility, as well as the latest weapons technology.

The enemy forces charged forward, eager to take advantage of the fresh blood on the battlefield. But the superhuman soldiers moved like lightning and destroyed the opposition with ease. Within minutes, dozens of enemy forces lay dead on the ground and the battle was over.

The superhuman soldiers had saved the day and ended the war. It was the first use of superhuman soldiers in open combat and it would be remembered for years to come. They had rewritten the rules of how war was fought, setting a new standard for military operations all over the world.
