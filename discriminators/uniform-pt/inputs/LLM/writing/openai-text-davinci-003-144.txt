Dear [Name],

There are never enough words to express the admiration, love, and respect I have for you. You have been there for me every step of the way, from picking up the broken pieces to rebuilding. You have walked an extra mile for me, pushed past complacency for me, and stood in the storm for me. You are an angel sent from heaven.

For too long, I have held back the appreciation that I have for you. I carry guilt in my heart for not expressing this gratitude, for not telling you just how much you mean to me and for taking you for granted for so long.

You have done so much for me and asked for very little in return and now I want to thank you. Thank you for being there for me and always showing unconditional love and support. Thank you for understanding me, believing in me, and pushing me to be a better version of myself. I also want to thank you for your openness and willingness to listen, your patience, and patience when I can’t find the words to explain myself.

I don’t know if I'm capable of showing my appreciation completely, but be assured that it is present, overflowing, and will never vanish.

With deep gratitude,

[Your Name]
