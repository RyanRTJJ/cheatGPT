���a hack ���on the New York Stock Exchange, and the September 13 2015 outages at the United Airlines website. ���The hack is linked to what appears to be a cyberattack by North Korea, who has been blamed for similar hacks to disrupt financial institutions in the past. ���These outages have been occurring nearly daily since the day after United Airlines went into damage-control mode following the July 8 outages. With the New York Stock Exchange outages, the hack appears to be connected, in a sense, to a cyberattack by North Korea. ���This might, on the surface, make the story seem more like a classic story, in which North Korea is behind this attack. ���However, this scenario is not only wrong, it's not even likely ��� it's just a coincidence that these events all occurred at the same time, one after another. ���One can only use this as a cautionary tale for other companies not to underestimate the threat from North Korea because, like United Airlines, they have been hit by cyberattacks over this period. ���As to why a hack at that level would affect United Airlines ���which has been one of the worst hit companies over the last year���, one would have to assume that the United Airlines hackers are doing something beyond simply exploiting these vulnerabilities on the system. ���This would be difficult to explain by any reasonable explanation. ���One can understand why this hacking occurred because, while the attacks have not occurred against United Airlines, they've been impacting other companies that serve similar clients. ���This is how cyberattacks are put into action by North Korea, by attacking a larger network. ���This is a risk they are willing to take because they cannot imagine that they would not also be capable of exploiting their capabilities on a smaller system. ���In fact, the North Korean cyberattack on United Airlines on July 8 was so complex, they probably had their own back-end security system, and this allowed them to conduct this attack with less human intervention. ���This is
