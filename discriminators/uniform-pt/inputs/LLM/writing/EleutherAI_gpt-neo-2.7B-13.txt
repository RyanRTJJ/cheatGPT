And I mean we'll be making an actual movie of course!

The Universe isn't just a simulation. It's a very, very complex simulation with many layers. And in the Universe, when it was being run by a person, there were bugs which would pop up and make the person get upset with what they were doing. So, instead of doing it all over again, they added a second person to start the simulation and do the debugging work. When they finished, they took the person out and put in a third one who was supposed to be a "real person", but in reality was just a simulation running and adding bugs. When the bugs went away, the person, in the end, did his work and did it well, and thus "realized the Universe was a simulation".

I'm writing this story and I like when writing stories are based on things you've already seen at least once, because it forces you to come up with things to add to the story that haven't already been written. So, please, consider writing a story in which the Universe makes a mistake, and then takes us out, and then runs us through the simulation for us. What happened in our universe to us?

Edit: I'll look at some of the ideas so I can be sure I've not completely forgotten that this whole thing works, but please, I'm not trying to make this as difficult as possible. Please, make it fun.

I've edited to add two things: when the first person is not in space, there can be bugs in this too, so this person has to always be there, in other worlds, in the past, in the future, every single step of the way, all of the time. The second thing is that I've started writing this, because the Universe, although simulated, is still really, really complicated.
