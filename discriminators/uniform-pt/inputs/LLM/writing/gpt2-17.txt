--------------------------- We only need to complete this story to qualify for the "Story of The Dead" story, so this means that it's all about survival! ================================================ ========== A VERY STRONG PROPOSAL ================================================ As with most life events, my story doesn't really get the story it would like. That being said, I'm not ashamed to say that I'm very talented, very talented at my job and I just love being able to write funny, funny stories, such as that about how the dead are better off without me. It's pretty simple, really. Don't be afraid to write funny stories! ================================================ |SQUASH PEARLIER| ================================================ [4] The "Bloody New York" Story ================================================ The story begins with the first death of someone. The protagonist dies of cancer at age 15, and a few years later, he is sent home to his grave. Unfortunately, he does not live to live another 20 years due to a mysterious disease. For some reason, when he meets his father, he becomes deeply obsessed with the death of his father, and begins to obsess about him. His obsession with him is led by his father, Dr. Peter, who happens to be a medical consultant to Dr. Bison's New York hospital. He believes that he is destined to live through his mother's death. This obsession leads to a struggle between the two of them in which the former says that as he becomes more determined about his own health he will stop seeing his mother while he is recovering and will not take his time to mourn himself with other people. Upon realizing that this dream is false, and that he should go into exile for the life he will never see, his father refuses to let Peter, who has always cared for him, be in his life so that he can experience the life for which he spent his life.
