 Now how is this post in line with the current topic?
I don't see any issues here. You can't expect a thread to be strictly about the topic you're discussing... it needs to be about the topic. There's a reason why posts on reddit are called conversations.
I didn't say it should be. That was the point of your previous comment.  I thought the point in the thread was 'what made people think this was a prank'? The joke being the story had no connection to the thread topic as the poster clearly didn't write it and OP didn't ask the question the first time.  How could you not understand my frustration?
No, I did understand frustration - but you *could* have worded it better.
I know. I could of but I wanted a fight so.... here we are.  My frustration with the title and the way OP worded it was because I've seen this exact story posted in a bunch of different subreddits where OP has worded it better and still this exact post is in breach of the rules and not welcome at all.  OP got no respect.
Ahh, now we're getting somewhere. You seem to be the only one who thinks this was a bad post, so I'm sure it's fair for you to complain.
Well it did reach the top so obviously there are people in agreement. That's quite impressive, really.
And the upvotes also suggest a majority of the people disagree with you.
Upvote does not equal agreement. The fact it got attention at all in the first place speaks volumes. What does that tell you?
Ahhhh well if it got the attention of one other person then must say it worked, so, whatever.
