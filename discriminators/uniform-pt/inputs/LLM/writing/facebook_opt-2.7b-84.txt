 Use the tag [IP].  Post it in the daily writing thread and you'll get a critique and a critique point.
The problem is I don’t really have any ideas for that because she won’t give me one.
You can read the entire prompt for people to get started writing a story for it. Or just keep looking around till you find one that sounds interesting to you.
Yeah I should probably do that. I’ve been thinking of it as more of a personal essay but I figured if I did it as a story it’d be more interesting.
Don't bother rewriting it. Just write your story and post it here when done. People really respond well to the writing prompts.
Okay that sounds like a good idea.
Good luck! And post the link here :)
How do I go about doing that exactly? It’s literally the top post for r/writing.
Just open the link in any new tab... (on a computer). Open it in an incognito window... it won't show up like it was written by somebody else.  Now you can post the story on the writing prompt thread. It will say something about your post when you do.  The more people who see it, the more help you will get.  Hope this helps! :)
Thank you I’ll do that.
You're welcome! Enjoy :)  I know you'll do great because you're a good writer!
Thank you :) writing is one of the things I love the most. I’m really hoping this works.
The writing part or the poetry writing part?
Writing, sorry.
Haha it's an easy answer.  When you write you focus on one thing and just let it flow until it's finished.  When you read, your brain takes in all of the words you've read and makes connections in your head (making your words easier to understand). So it's like writing but just reading!  Hope it works for you!
