 and decide to do something that's not easy (e.g. get the hell out of there) and then things get even worse.  Your only leverage is the fact that he's a coward and you have a gun.
3.) The Big One     (Fantasy)
  If you've read fantasy before, this one pretty much fits.  You get to have sex with a goddess and then die.  You're reincarnated after having sex with her to a new world where you must then find love and live to be a hundred with the person you loved.  It's the ultimate adventure story.
I'll be releasing the next three in this series, based on the prompts I get from readers.  I hope you want to know what happens next. You'll get updates as I write them over the next few months.
(1)- (3)     (7)-(10)
Thanks very much to everyone who has contributed their own prompts from other authors and asked me to write about them. I have put them all in a separate spoiler box to hide them from the readers who don't want to read them.
Keep in mind that I can't guarantee that you're going to see these stories, or I'll be so excited to give you a chance that I'll spoil a story you've been waiting for.
Also, if you know me at all, you know that this is a little weird for me, and I have to be as coy as possible.

P.S. - If you're looking for additional stories, or some of my favorites, I've put them all up on One Story Archive, and it is absolutely free.  I encourage you to read them.  The stories are in a variety of genres, and all have amazing titles and author bios, I encourage you to take a look.
P.P.S.-I can guarantee you will see my next story released, so if you don't read each one already, this shouldn't put
