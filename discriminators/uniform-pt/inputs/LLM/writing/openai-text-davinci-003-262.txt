Trevor had hit rock bottom. After years of bad luck, he had lost his job, his house, and all his possessions. He had no family or friends close enough to help him out of the desperate situation he was in.

Desperation had driven Trevor to enter the Games – a new form of entertainment where people were brought to the brink of death then teleported to medics who normally revived them. The longer one survived, the more money they would earn.

When Trevor was first brought to the Games, he was in a frenzy of fear and confusion. He had no training or experience in this kind of thing and was convinced he would end up dead.

But one day, after weeks of surviving in the Games, Trevor realized that he was actually quite good at it. He learned quickly and adapted to the new challenges the Games threw at him.

With the money he earned, Trevor was able to get back on his feet and start over. People even started to look at him with admiration and respect, despite his humble beginnings.

Trevor eventually became one of the most successful participants in the Games and earned more money than he ever could have dreamed of. He discovered that death did not have to be the end – it could be a new beginning.
