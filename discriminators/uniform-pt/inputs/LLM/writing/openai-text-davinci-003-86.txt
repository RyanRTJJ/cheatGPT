Lily had always believed in a higher power, it just never really had a name. Throughout her life, she actively sought to make the world around her a better place. Little did she know, these actions lined up precisely with the tenants of Christianity. 

When Lily died, she awoke in a place she had never before experienced. It was beautiful, inviting, and familiar. With everything looking just as she had thought it should, she assumed that she had made it to the afterlife of her faith. 

Little did she know that she had, in fact, arrived in the afterlife of Christianity. Her compassionate and kind spirit had unwittingly earned her a place in this sacred realm. 

Lily spent eternity in the kingdom of heavenly joy, surrounded by the compassionate love of pure goodness. She was welcomed warmly and was blissfully happy in her new circumstance. 

The moral of the story: regardless of what religion or faith you adhere to in life, it is the actions we take that truly determine our fate. Wherever we end up, rest assured that we will be surrounded by what we sought while living upon this earth.
