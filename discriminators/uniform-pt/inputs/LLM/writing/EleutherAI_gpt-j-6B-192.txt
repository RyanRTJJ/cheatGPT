Â We all fail. Â Sometimes in big ways, other times in small ways. When I look at my own life, I have to admit that I've made more than my share of mistakes, and I've failed more than a few other times. So it is with all of us. We can't know the future, but it's fun to predict the best and worst that could happen. For instance, you may have heard of the TV show, "Lost." After reading Lost, you might think that it's kind of unrealistic to go somewhere that is completely uncharted and completely surrounded by crazy, violent, and dangerous people. But remember, it's fiction, and there are many shows based on books that are like that too. Just think about a world where everyone was just normal. They ate normal food. They would go to normal school. Normal people like you, me, and your friends. The only difference would be that, like Lost has done, it has taken place in unknown areas that are surrounded by dangerous people, with few people who can be counted on to know how to cope in those dangerous areas. If those things did happen, who would really have our back? Would there be people who could handle the situations? Would there really be "Good guys"? And what happens when the bad guys figure it out too? What happens if you don't know how to properly defend yourself from a crazy, violent, and dangerous man who is also a great shot and a fast and agile runner? Who is going to come rushing to your rescue when the crazy, violent, and dangerous man you are defending yourselves against throws one punch and turns on you? That is what this story will be about. The characters are going to face real life situations in a story environment. They have to work against the odds and not always follow the easy, obvious way
