In this world, food is judged as to its nutritional value on a scale with points ranging from 1 to 5.

The father responds, "It’s just that you’re a much higher race than they are. They don’t have any of the things you’re talking about – vitamin D and protein. You may be hungry for this kind of meat, but you don’t have to eat it!"
