I'm going to write something about writing, and then I'm going to post it here.
In case you're wondering what this is, here it is, folks.
I'm a writer, yes, you've heard me talk about it plenty of times but the question is how do I feel about it, what does it mean to me, you might feel the same. 
Writing isn't work, you know. It's a hobby. It's fun. It's a pleasure. 
It's a part of life, a part of my life more so than anything else. 
I'm a writer, and I've been told that I've done things really great.
And I believe every one of you who said about me that I've done things really big and I've done things really fine.
You've meant it with every word. You've done things great. 
You've been more important to me than anything else in the universe, I won't lie about it. 
That makes writing even better, you know, because I'm not just somebody who does it on days when I feel like writing. 
I'm somebody who has to write and who doesn't just do it whenever.
This thing I do is all about something else, something very valuable, and I do it every day because I have to, because I enjoy it. 
You see? It's the writing that matters, not the writing itself.
A writer is never done,
as I've told countless number of people who were trying to convince me otherwise.
I'm not done. 
I'm never done,
until I reach my goals. 
My goals are to try and write a better book, to try and better my style, and to be a writer that feels good and that makes people better. 
Those are my goals. 
That's why I do what I do everyday, it keeps going, that's where it gets better.
Maybe it's not your kind of thing, don't do it, then
