This is a prompt asking people to write a story using the prompt as a basis. The prompt is inspired by these people: [ IP ] In real life ______

[ IP ] A computer __________________

[ IP ] On an airplane ________________________

[ IP ] Your neighbor _______________________

[ IP ] Your mailman ____________________

[ IP ] Your dog______________________________

[ IP ]... and anyone else who might write anything from a "real" live _____ _





The goal of this prompt is to write a story that includes any of the people that are given in the prompt. You should include a description of each of the persons or objects in the prompt.









As you write your stories please remember the following:

Don't judge.

You don't need to read your own work so don't.

Don't criticize. If you get a problem with whatever it is, then write it down and try to find a solution in your story. If there isn't one, then just write a different story.

If you are not sure what to write about just be sure not to write the thing in real live.











Write your story with the question word "in" as a key phrase. To write your story use this syntax:





[ Person or Object ] do(s) what they (it) got(s) to do











Example



You do what you got to do



Your story doesn't need to go into great detail, but it needs to describe what the person/object did or says.





If you have a story, be sure to share it by adding it to the comment section at the bottom, and if you have an image, be sure to share it as well. Click on your nick for the image so we can see it.
