 Edit: This is the original question and prompt. Thanks, u/lil-maniac
I really want to do something like this but I don't have a ton of imagination. I also have a feeling my "characters" would be really boring compared to all of the awesome stuff we did in real life.
It helps if you imagine what their situation *could* be like. What are their hopes, fears, goals?   We can give them an origin story too. Maybe they know the world. You could describe their culture. Or maybe they're an alien, come to this planet for the first time.   We can play with whatever you imagine.
I like it, sounds good to me. I'll write my take and we can see what happens.   If you don't mind, could I include your take? I don't mind posting my story on here but I'd like to give you a chance to see yours. Maybe we can post a story to see what people prefer.
That's cool, I'll definitely read your take! I wasn't planning to write a separate thing and I'll definitely be posting my take here also.
Thanks man, it might take a few days cause I'm super busy right now. My boyfriend's mother just gave birth to a boy so hopefully I'll have more time for my projects. If my girlfriend doesn't have kid #3 by the time I'm done with the story (I hope she doesn't) I'll send you the updated version.
I'll definitely be here, no worries! When the new baby is born I'll certainly need some more of your time!
Ok good deal! That makes 3 people that will read it as soon as it's up. Can't wait!
