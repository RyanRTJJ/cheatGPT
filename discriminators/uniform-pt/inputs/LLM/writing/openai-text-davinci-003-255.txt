Erica and Ramon had been friends since their freshman year of college and their bond only got stronger and stronger as the years went by. One day, the two friends decided to take a road trip out to the countryside to explore. 

Little did they know they were headed towards an adventure they could have never expected. After a day of exploring, they stumbled upon an old fountain surrounded by large trees. Intrigued, they went to investigate, only to discover something even more incredible: the fountain had water that could make you look and feel younger. Upon drinking the water, the two were instantly transformed into babies. 

At first, they were both dizzy and confused, but soon they figured it out and realized they had stumbled across a Fountain of Youth. Excited and overwhelmed, they quickly realized the only way to take advantage of this was to take turns raising each other. 

So, for nearly 20 years, the two friends took turns being a baby and a parent, living together and supporting each other for eternity. Growing up a few years, having a few adventures, then aging back down to a baby, only to do it all over again. 

But eventually, Ramon grew more and more restless with the idea of never getting any older. He wanted to experience life as an adult and live without constantly having to care for someone else. Erica agreed that it was in his best interest to break their agreement, and strong-heartedly allowed Ramon to make the crucial decision. Erica understood his needs, even though it meant she would stop living forevert.
