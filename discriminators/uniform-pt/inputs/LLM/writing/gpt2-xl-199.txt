I don't actually use the word'satan'- I'm calling him a god.

He's like an evil genie.

Like you use your wish to get a free gift, he wants to make your whole family miserable.


Haha, it's actually funny because it's like Satan trying his hardest to make everyone miserable.

I know people can be very stubborn here, but like a 'please give me something' is enough to get you out of the situation where everyone loves you and you're a lovable jerk.


He's a real asshole and a pain to do business with.

He has people lined up and waiting for him to show up just to give him crap.

He always tells you to do something for him and what he wants you to do is to send him something.

If it wasn't for him or for me.

He would never have the chance to make everyone miserable.

I always ask for something in return for my stuff and he always gives me the most 'insider' stuff.

I am his business partner and I'm his secretary and I love him.

If a contract comes in the mail, I'm sooooooo sure it's from him.


All that stuff above was just a lot of fun when I wrote it, but now that I'm working on it.

It's just all really, really boring.


Oh and don't you hate it when you do your homework in the morning?

For some reason, I'm always really tired this morning.

Like, I feel like I must be in a coma.


I hope you guys enjoy! Happy Writing
