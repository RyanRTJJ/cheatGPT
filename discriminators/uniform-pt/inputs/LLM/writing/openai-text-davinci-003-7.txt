It had been centuries since the discovery of the system, "Sol," home to eight planets and a variety of living organisms. But it had only been a few years since scientists began exploring the system in depth, uncovering its secrets and advacnes of its inhabitants. However, none could have predicted the recent turn of events.

Just yesterday, the system was officially declared a biohazard zone and put under quarantine. Any and all exploration in the Sol System was prohibited. Reports of a mysterious and deadly virus, killing both intelligent and non-intelligent species, quickly spread throughout the galaxies.

The virus, known as the "Sol virus," was an incredibly deadly and virulently contagious pathogen that had the ability to transmit between species, both terrestrial and extraterrestrial. Scientists were unable to determine the source of the virus, but preliminary studies suggest that it may have been due to cross species contact between the intelligent and non-intelligent species within the Sol System.

Although a cure has yet to be found, the Galactic Council has issued an emergency protocol called "Operation Sol," which involves massive relief efforts, including medical support and the implementation of top-of-the-line quarantine measures.

As of now, the fate of the eight planets remains uncertain, and the inhabitants of Sol face an uncertain future. Whether or not the citizens will survive, or the planets themselves, is up to the experts at work searching for a way to stop the virus and restore the peace and order of Sol.
