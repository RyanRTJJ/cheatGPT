I had always wanted to buy a house, but little did I know that the house I finally settled on would be hiding such a bizarre secret. I had just moved into my new house and I was exploring the basement when I stumbled upon a mysterious journal.

Opening the book cautiously, I saw that it was dated one hundred years ago. Its author was none other than a vampire. The journal was filled with stories, entries, and thoughts from the vampire's life. He had gone into detail of his life and his struggles for acceptance, along with his struggles for control over his hunger for blood.

I was both enthralled and frightened by this journal, but I still couldn't help but keep reading. I read about how this vampire would blend in with everyday life and how he would use his powers of mind control and shape shifting to try and survive in the human world. He had set down rules for himself so that he would never turn someone into a vampire unless they truly believed in him and understood why the must swear fealty to him.

I was equal parts horrified and amazed at the detail and dark secrets that lay within the journalâ€™s pages. I knew I had uncovered something extraordinary and unsettling, yet fascinating at the same time.

Eventually I had to step away as I could no longer handle the fear I felt as I continued reading. I stored the journal in my closet, determined to learn more about this unusual character. I hope to one day solve the mystery of this journal, and the dark secrets it holds.
