______________________________________ You must describe an event or place in the past that you personally witnessed.

The following is the story my teacher told me while I was a child, and it seems so apt for my life at this time.

There once was a girl who dreamt she lived in a wonderful little world. She wanted to go beyond, but it was no use, for she found no way out. She had heard a little voice that told her that she must choose, and when she was asked, she chose to go. On and on she went, with a constant dread growing in her heart until she had to flee to another, bigger world just to escape it, for when she was at the last end of her journey—she ran out of air! When she went, she discovered no way of breathing, not even with all the air she had. In despair, she lay down to die, but something in her nature told her that her life had been better than that. For when she died, she became a butterfly which fluttered around the world until she flew over the mountain of her parents’ home. As the wind blew over the land, she became the wind, and thus life flowed naturally into the world again. [1]

But I would really like to know what to do with an event that happened to me when I was 9. I loved to fly, but I always found that I had to hang on tightly to the branch of an overhanging tree, or else I could not take wing. The trouble was that whenever I was high up I could not reach down to the ground. My eyes were always on the sky, I knew, and that made flying too easy.

Yet I was a very brave old boy, and I used to fly down to the playground of my school, and get the other childrens’ attention by being the first one to leap to the ground: “Look at me, look at me, children, how I’m flying!”

No matter what
