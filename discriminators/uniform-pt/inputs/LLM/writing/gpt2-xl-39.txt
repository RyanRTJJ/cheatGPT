In a fantasy world, a girl has just discovered her bloodline of the dragon tribe, which she's never seen or heard of before. What will she do now?

Even though she could've gotten me a lot of nice stuff for Christmas (I have my entire room filled up with books and I haven't had a TV since I turned five), if I did ever get
