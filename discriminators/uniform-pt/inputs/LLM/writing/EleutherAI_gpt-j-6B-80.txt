 There's no point in writing a novel, because it either gets published or not. 
What do you think happened? 

 The world was plunged into a state of mindlessness. It's like an ant colony. Everyone did what they knew how to do...

I don't think it's a good idea to write what you know is more compelling than what you don't know.

You need to set things up so the reader knows it's an interrogation.

The hero enters the police station room at a certain time and asks 
  where he can find the boss.  The cops all look at the door and
  shrug.  The hero looks at the cops and sees  that they're too bored to
  think of lying.  "No, no, sir," says the old man pointing  into the
  room at the man at the door. The Hero opens the door  and finds an FBI
  agent waiting.

    The Hero gives the FBI agent
       everything he knows and goes back to the local
       police station to deal with matters there.

After you've set the scene up, you have to find a reason the hero has
  to talk to the FBI if nothing significant has occurred so far in the story.  The FBI agent would normally wait outside while he is doing his research, but the writer doesn't have control over what's happening in the story and you need some reason why the hero is there.  The FBI agent has been in the room when something important happened to the hero so they have a motive to talk to him about it.  
The FBI agent also gives them a motive to talk to the hero... the hero was on a list of the 5 most wanted fugitives, there's been a major crime and all the cops have been looking for him, so that has to be good
