 You have 48 hours.
Oh man.   You could make up a bunch of different stories that would all essentially give the same prompt.    "I'm not good enough to be the hero and I'm not bad enough to be the villain."    I would love a story like that based on a prompt.
I might even write one...
I'd look forward to it!   But then, I'd also look forward to a *lot* of things. :P
I'm gonna try, maybe if I come up with a good plot it'll be worth it.   What do you usually use for prompts?
I often forget about it once my school starts.   I think I used one just today from you about one of the students at the YA and one from you about how her friends might react to her leaving
That ones been sitting in my notes...   I should do something eventually. Maybe I'll just write the most general plot. It sounds more like something I can just keep working on.   What kind of stories do you get the most ideas from?
Everything.   Mostly fantasy, action, horror, but I also enjoy a little bit of comedy too.
I'm not that creative, so all I have is a general story idea which has potential I'm hoping to fleshen out. So far most of my ideas are a little to silly to fit your prompts. But I really want to be able to do something with it.   What kind of story are you going to write?
I've actually decided to write a dark comedy about a girl who gets pulled to the "other side."   If you can write about the story ideas you come up with, I'd love to see them.   I'm not sure you're creative because I really just write down what ideas cross my mind :)
I think I could give a pretty good one.
