A:

The boy takes his gun and shoots at random people on the school grounds.  Since he doesn't care who is innocent, he starts blasting holes in people.  
One of the cops decides to take on the shooter just after he got rid of him.  (Side note:  I would change this to have multiple people take on the shooter.  While it doesn't change the actual plot, it adds one more layer of chaos to the story if different cops can kill the boy with completely different methods, causing new problems.)
In order to take down the student they need to find the gun, so they go in search of the shooter with lots of firepower.  They are told that if they shoot, they will go to prison.  They start with shooting the school grounds, looking under bushes, and looking in various places, but no luck.  They move on to the classrooms, as the student must of come from, thinking, since he had to have come that way, there has to be a dead end in the room.  Once they go through a set of doors, they find the boy.  They shoot him, and he falls dead; no need to chase him across the field after all.
The next chapter, or section in the chapter, would involve the cops hunting for his family.  We will assume that the family didn't give any indication that he was unstable or had such intentions.

 We will then find the family in the house, looking in the freezer.  The cop tells them that they were right in trying to seek help, and that they should file a missing persons report.  The cops leave, and the family starts getting rid of the body.

On the walk home to his family, the boy takes the gun outside of school, where he realizes his plan
