 Why should a ghost want to eat a dead zombie?  A zombie that has just eaten another person would eat them, you see?
The winner will be announced next night at the start of a regular story session.  The winner will be able to select a new ghost.  And if you want to play, you can either select your own ghost or you can submit (and your own tale) or you can select any of the other people that are participating in your story.
The winner will also be given a special book.  The book I'm considering is a little book of zombie stories about how to have a lot of fun while playing with zombies, as well as about zombie-themed video games. The two winners will be able to choose the text as well (which will be in a book along with their winning entry). There will also be a postmortem. If anyone wanted, they could use this opportunity to give a speech about where they think the competition is going to go next.
The book will probably be a little more geared toward short term storytelling than long. The book must be at least two months in length, and there will probably not be anywhere near as many stories as the competition.  I'm just not sure how many people will want to do a zombie story about the food at a restaurant that's closed until we reopen.  With a few notable exceptions (but those will not be published), all the stories will have to be self-contained and not reliant off each other (I've got other ideas on where to throw a story).
I'm not sure what the prizes are, but we'll just start with a set of regular story entries, then get people from the group to submit one to be included in the book, and we'll vote on the one that's included in the book.  I'll do a poll on
