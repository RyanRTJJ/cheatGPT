_______________________________________ In the past few months, I’ve been stuck in elevators with two business partners who have been friends for many years. In each of these instances (which you can learn about by reading the story I link to in the prompt), I’ve been so aggravated that I could only breathe through my teeth and my ears. Today, I’ll share the only way that I’ve found to be able to breathe fully: I had to leave the elevator. I know, it might seem a little extreme, but it’s also really hard to explain why it was so painful. And I had to get out because, I was thinking, my whole business depends on a strong working relationship between us. Because I could no longer ignore the tension in our working relationship, the idea that we would fight on an elevator had become a real threat to my survival.

As I write this post, it’s the very end of my second month of the #30daysoffightingstress. I find that it’s a really unique habit to start and maintain for the first few weeks, but as soon as you stop, a whole new kind of anxiety starts to develop.

Even though this is the end of my second month, I still have quite a bit to say about it. It’s still something that really affects my life and my mood on a day-to-day basis. I also don’t know where this is going exactly, so this is probably the time that I’ll have to say that it’s the end of my challenge and
