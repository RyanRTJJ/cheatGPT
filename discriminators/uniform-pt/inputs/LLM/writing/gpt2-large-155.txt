 As a writer, is it ok?  Is it ok to have such a character who has mastered Death in the pursuit of immortality?  What do you think? Have your characters cheat death in the pursuit of immortality.
1.  A man has an affair with "Aunt" (friend, lover, or lover in disguise) and kills her as a way to keep her secrets.  Did this man just get caught doing this?  If yes, how did he get caught?  What do you think?  Have you thought about using that relationship as a starting point for another story? 2.  A man, who lives out a fantasy to get back at his lover (friend, lover, or lover in disguise), is given the opportunity to prove it.  Can he kill his beloved and escape death?  Is this kind of revenge always the right answer? (Note that this question is not intended to be a prompt for revenge.  It is meant to show you the problem of getting back at someone). 3.  A man is caught cheating on his wife (friend, lover, or lover in disguise).  Why?  Can he actually cheat on his wife and still be right?  Is this kind of cheating usually wrong?  And will you let it take over your life?  Can you live with it? Or do you think the situation may be too awkward not to go on record as breaking up? 4.  A vampire hunts his mortal foe.  Where does this character come from? Is he undead?  How did he get this level of power?  What do you think about such a character? 5.  A soldier takes this battle to his death.  What do you think the story's conclusion would be?  What do you think of this story? What did you think about the ending of this story?
