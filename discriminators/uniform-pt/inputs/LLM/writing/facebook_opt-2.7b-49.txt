 (The most you could write is a story about the hitman learning to deal with his luck being cursed.)
This is the most fantastic idea ever. I'm very sure this is not possible without some sort of magic.
Read the original prompt: The world's luckiest man prepares to kill the world's luckiest hitman. FTFY.
Well shit. If I'm to believe Wikipedia, no one could actually write that story.   So... you've made me want to write it much, much less than I planned.
Write it anyway! It could become a series, and you'll get a lot of experience on writing short stories for a short story contest or something. Do your best!
I was going to do a whole bunch of short stories for an anthology I'm writing/hoping to write, but I kind of want to try to focus more on working on some longer stuff. Plus the whole universe thing.   So maybe I'll do some short stories first. I'll let you guys know how they go if I don't forget and post them later!
Ok, keep us informed! I really enjoy seeing people trying new things, but it's important to do what pleases you. Hopefully everyone's happy!  Also, if you post the story, don't be afraid to edit for feedback! We're all learning here.
So, I've decided not to post it so people have to pay for it. Not fair, given how the story took me two days. I might put it on r/WritingPrompts instead, if you guys think that would be better. Also, I kind of want to use the characters from this story for something else in the future.
I'm interested in reading it. If you have a link or something, I'll add it to this pile of awesome.
