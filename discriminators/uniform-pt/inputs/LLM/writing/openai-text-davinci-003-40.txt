Once upon a time there was a man, Joe, who had a bit of a foul mouth. He could sometimes be seen uttering curse words and expletives from left and right, in response to little annoyances throughout his day.

One day, Joe decided to visit the local antique store. As he was perusing through all the knick-knacks and curiosities, he came across a very interesting jar. It was just an ordinary jar, there was nothing fancy about it, but for some unknown reason Joe was immediately drawn to it. Against his better judgement, he decided to purchase the jar.

Once he got home, he placed the jar on his mantle and forgot all about it. Until one day, while he was having a heated argument with his friend, Joe let out a few choice curse words. To his disbelief, a few moments later he saw a dollar slip through the bottom of the jar, it had simply appeared out of thin air!

Joe was beyond confused and excited. He had all but forgotten about the jar, but here was proof that it had some sort of magical powers! He quickly realized that every time he swore, a dollar would appear inside the jar.

Amazed, Joe started to swear every chance he got, excited to add a few extra dollars to his savings. Over time, not only did the dollars start piling up, but Joe also made quite a bit of progress with his anger management. After all, no one wants to constantly have to deal with the consequences of a magical jar! 

The magical jar was the best purchase Joe ever made. Not only did it teach him better self-control, it also filled him up with precious dollars!
