I never knew why my parents told me to never go into the room at the end of the hallway. I guess a part of me was always curious to see what was inside, but I was scared of getting in trouble. But today, I finally decided to courageously unlock the door and enter the room.

When I slowly opened the door, I was shocked to see how different it was from the rest of the house. Everything was made of a different material than the other rooms. The walls were covered in thick, gold wallpaper and the furniture was intricate and elegant with a royal-like vibe to it. I was even more surprised to see a winding staircase leading up to the ceiling with a secret door at the top. 

My adventurous spirit took hold, and I began to ascend the stairs to uncover what was hidden at the top. I slowly pushed open the secret door and could hardly believe my eyes. Inside was a room decorated with jewels, paintings and statues. It was like a palace inside! I could hardly contain my excitement.

I slowly walked around the room, admiring the beauty of the artworks and furniture. I had to sit down for a moment to take in the sheer beauty around me. As I sat there taking it all in, I heard my parents footsteps coming down the hallway. I quickly shut the door and pretended I hadn't gone in.

My parents were surprised to see me in the hallway and asked what I was doing there. I told them I found the room intriguing and wanted to explore it. My parents looked at each other and then back to me, and said, "We thought this room was forgotten. We never expected you to come here. We are so proud of your curiosity and bravery."
