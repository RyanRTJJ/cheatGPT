  You shoot him in the head to be sure his identity is safe. You keep playing video games.   Then, a couple days later when you need a break from these thoughts and memories and start playing a new game, he turns up in you're inventory.   You find out he is Santa.   You shoot him because you know his real identity.
How would you explain the other half of the scenario to the reader without putting them in a mental panic?
Don't shoot him, because it's just your mind trying to create an easy plot to a story. Don't shoot the devil, because you're just fucking with your own mind.   Shoot yourself, because this is a real problem for you.   Or at least, that's how I think it'd work!
I think I'll change my story to this. It's more fun that way, and I'd get some good practice for the real story as well. It's a real problem for me, and I've been trying to figure out a solution for a while now. And yeah, it's better than sitting down and playing my xbox for hours. I'll definitely be doing it the other way after some time passes. Thanks for the help!
No problemo! This is probably more original than the majority of the ideas I hear about in this thread. It's certainly original. I wish you luck!
Thanks! I love the idea of writing something completely original! I'll also be sure to share it with you when it's done, if that's ok? But I definitely see a lot of potential for things that *aren't* this, and think that if I stick to something, people will probably get something out of it.   Have a good night!  And if you're ever looking for an original idea, shoot me a message! I'm pretty good. ^.^
I'd want to read it as well.
What's your user? I added a few others to the list yesterday, some I'd love
