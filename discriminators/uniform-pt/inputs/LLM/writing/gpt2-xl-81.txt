"We would all love to believe that we're alone in the universe. The universe does not need the sun. The universe does not need us.
The universe doesn't need us. All that's needed is us.
All that's needed is the sun for everything... And then maybe that sun makes life a little easier." -Cindy Chiao
My Story! The sun sets in the East, and with it, the light and warmth of the night and the morning rush to give place in the West, but still, the sun shines. The morning rush brings me to the city on the water and I spend the morning with friends and the afternoon and all the night with my family, and I see the world through the eyes of my sisters, both here on our island, and here in the city, and they are both in the sun. I hear them call each other home at first light and I know they are with me and I want to be there, but I can't. My hands aren't to steady myself in the wind, the leaves are whipping, but I am here with them in the sunlight on a warm summer's day and I am at rest in an ocean of softness.  As the sun sets, I head to the shore and stand at the water's edge watching for the first hint of a shadow and soon is enough. I swim to the rock outcropping where I first touched the smooth and beautiful stone. This is it, this is why I'm still here. I climb to the top of the rock and gaze back at this moment that will forever be mine and now I am home. After a moment, I make my way back over to my family and sit on the rock beside them and kiss them goodnight, and my family are my home. I kiss the sandstone and I see my sisters there in the sun and we go to sleep. We all fall asleep in the same bed before the sun rises. My mother
