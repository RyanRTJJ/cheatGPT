My story:


First time in my life:

Date: September 07th

Time: 9:00 AM

What I wrote: [ R ] Jay Gatsby meets Daisy through an ancient time portal. After he tries to make her his girlfriend back to the past, one of his visions of her comes to reality.


Second time and a second dream.

Date: - 09:00 AM

Time: 8:30 PM

What I wrote: [ R ] Daisy and Jay start off as friends and then things get weird and they fall in love, eventually.


Third time and a third dream.

Date: - 10:00 PM

Time: 9:30 PM

What I wrote: [ R ] Daisy and Jay finally get together and take some time to relax.


In the future, Daisy has been married to a nice man and has their daughter.


In the time between Jay's vision and a second dream, Daisy meets a crazy man in a car, who wants her to kill herself. And there it is. I hope you enjoyed the first try at an OC, and the OC is a little darker than the second one. Also, when I was asked before if the story might be a fic, I thought about doing one more for my OC and making it into an actual fic, but in the end decided against it. I'm not a huge fan of romance and can get into it or get through it, but I like a story that does some good things.I haven't started writing a whole fic for this because you know, it would take up too much time. I haven't started this because I don't want to be in the mood to write the story, but it is definitely a fic I would like to write. This might come and go, because one day I probably won't be that busy with other stuff. I would really appreciate any help that you want and
