__________________________________________________________________________ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ BOSS: Death - Magicite #23 Death is one of the stronger enemies that appear in the game. He can cast many powerful spells if he uses them, and can inflict a lot of damage on the party when using them. When he enters battle, be sure not to attack, as he has an attack called "Death's Fall". Death falls from the sky, while attacking everyone. It is most likely better to use a high level magic to defeat him. Use the same strategy that you used against the first boss to defeat him. It might hurt a little and take more time, but we're fighting for our lives. Once he falls, it's up to you to defeat him. ---------------------------------- Recommended best moves: Magic - A wide range attack, that hits all enemies around him. This is the most effective, and best way to deal with the Death. Poison - Poison, to poison him completely. The best method of dealing this is with one of the Magicite's attacks, 'Prayer of Steel'. After the casting takes effect, Death will be knocked back a limited range. Attack until he's knocked back a little bit farther, and repeat. Magicite #31 also applies this effect, even if it does not hit Death. Dark - This spell hits Death completely, but it leaves him with only 1 HP and no Mana. His defense is not too bad, but his Magicite#3 attack can be risky as well. It will also leave a small spark behind, just like the first two spells. You won't want to cast this on a group of party members if you don't want to waste a spell. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ After that, it's up to you to defeat the Magicite to win this battle. It's basically a normal dungeon fight, except that the boss has a lot more HP and is much stronger. The trick to this battle is that you can't fight on the wrong side of the wall, on the side where
