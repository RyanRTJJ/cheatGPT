************* The plane is on auto pilot. All the passengers are asleep, including the flight engineer, when the captain receives a message from the plane's radio. His voice indicates that the plane is approaching the end of its flying time limit. The plane must land at Beijing's Beijing Capital International Airport immediately or it will have to be towed to the nearest airport. The captain and assistant captain will stay awake for ten hours to ensure that the landing takes place on time. They will then go home as soon as the plane lands and all passengers are safely off the plane. ************* Thats a nice story, it is something that i have always dreamed about and would love to read. I don't know the date, if it's from the same author, but i'd like to read more. ************* Ohhhhhhhhhh, I love this!!! Aww man, you have my attention...and a lot of it. ************* I love it! I'm such a big fan. Thanks for sharing this! ************* This is the best book i've read that i can say its very short....my heart is already beating it will be really funny when it gets to the parts that are written by the author. Just like most writers i'm always surprised when they're not surprised anymore. Thats why it's good to know that you have a good humor. And again, you didn't fail, you just write more about the humor in the book then a person could ever have guessed. Theres no way your not laughing when she says how the pilot was laughing in a similar way, i know it sounds silly but she mentioned how much she loved the captain. I will read your next book as soon i get an time and place. Cheers from the UK Reply Delete
