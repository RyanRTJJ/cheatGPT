### Please don't go

If you would like to go, please don't go.  
Let's go one by one to decide whether this is a good idea.  
Don't you think it's time to let go?  
Or is what's important that you're doing right now really important?  
Is there someone out there who needs you more than you need anyone or anything?  
Do you know there's someone who loves you more than anything or anyone?  
Or maybe it's the opposite:  
You know you're not all that you could be and you're not enough and you want to be someone you don't have to be and you know it makes you feel uncomfortable, so you're keeping you to yourself and hoping the person who might have said that you're enough for you is the one you're going to love and tell all your secrets to and let you hold you while you cry all the time or while you laugh and tell jokes and never let you grow up and just tell you to eat your vegetables and not throw up on you or make you throw up on yourself, and not use you to make excuses for why you don't fit in and have too many responsibilities no matter what anybody says and no matter if you have enough friends and you know it or you're a loner and weird and your brain is always empty and sometimes you want to tell people that you're lonely but they're like no one else feels that way, you want to tell your friends that there's something wrong with you and you're probably crazy and you like boys or you like girls more than you did before, but you're not like any of your friends who are, and you want a girl that could make you feel normal and you know you're not pretty and you're not skinny and you've never had a boyfriend, but you're like so smart and
