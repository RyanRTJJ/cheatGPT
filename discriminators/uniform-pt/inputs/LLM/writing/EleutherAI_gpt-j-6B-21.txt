My answer is based on the piano itself and on the music surrounding us. However, I have written a more detailed answer just in case.

“Piano” is not the first word I would associate with this piece. The notes I hear when I look up at the piano, the sound I get when I brush my hand across the keys, the notes I hear when I put that same hand to cover the strings, the noise the keys make when I strike them too hard... Those are not the sounds a piano makes, the sound produced by them and those sounds could not be more distant from the sounds we hear when we look down at our hands. We don’t call their sounds sounds, we call them noises. And the music produced by this object is music, as we call it.

Noise is a disturbance in or on something that interferes with a person's ability to hear. The term can refer to an audible sound that may be unpleasant. It may also refer to sound that is less detectable, as in sound that is difficult to measure.

The thing that bothers us isn’t the notes that are being produced but the fact that this piece of junk is producing these noises. And what bothers us is how it’s producing the noises.

It’s not like there’s someone playing the piano nearby, and so we could simply have asked ourselves whether the piano was producing music.

It is that there’s something so alien about this entire situation. The whole thing is so different in terms of nature from that which we understand as music. It’s so unnatural a creature, so far removed from what we know as human existence...

There’s something that could only be described as a “pitch”, a “buzz”, or a sort of “murmur” or “static”, in the air. We don’t even know how we would have to speak about this something, these sounds we call noises, they’re just so alien, so foreign
