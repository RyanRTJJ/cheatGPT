The fight or flight response takes over as the roar of the engine stirs in the distance. A quick glance around the area reminds the small intruder of two very different options—that of either standing their ground or running wildly away from the danger.

It could easily be mistaken as one of those typical chopper flights, with a few added jitters as it begins to draw ever closer. Yet this feeling ran deeper than just a light rumble in the stomach—it was an inexorable urge to take action of some kind.

But what should that action be? Fight or flight?

The decision had to be made quickly as the predator came swooping down from the sky, its engine sending out menacing vibrations that shook the whole area. The feeling of being hunted created rivers of panic that flowed through the small figure below.

There was no time to think, and the brute force of terror drove the figure's body into action before their conscious mind could parse through the strategy. With one last look up at the descending menace, they resolve that only one choice remains—flight.

The figure turns and takes off, using all their energy to reach a safe distance. The sound of the machine soon fades away as they hastily escape the area, leaving the past few moments a distant memory.

But the feeling of being on edge remains, a reminder that in certain situations, running away can be the most rational option.
