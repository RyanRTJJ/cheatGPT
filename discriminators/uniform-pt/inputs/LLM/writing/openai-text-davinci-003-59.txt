It had been a normal day up until that point. I was going about my usual routine when I started to feel unwell. I decided I should go to the doctor and get checked out just to be sure.

To my horror, I learned from the doctor that I had contracted a rare and deadly virus. He informed me that I was the first recorded case of this virus and that there was no cure. He then gave me the unsettling news that there was only way that I could get rid of this virus: I had to infect someone else with it.

At first, I was in shock, not understanding how this could be possible. How could I purposely put someone else's life in danger in order to save myself? But then I remembered that, if I didn't do this, I would be the one in peril.

So, I made a decision. I would do whatever it took to survive, even if that meant passing this virus on to someone else. The following weeks were hard as I looked for a willing and unknowing host. I eventually found one, a benign person who had never done anything to hurt me. I infected them but I felt terrible for it, knowing that my actions would lead to a life of pain and suffering.

Although I am now healthy and virus-free, that guilt and burden of responsibility will be with me for the rest of my life.
