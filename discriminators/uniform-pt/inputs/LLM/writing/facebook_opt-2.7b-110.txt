 If you're willing to do this, let me know and I'll DM you for the link. I'd like to see it!
Sounds interesting!  I'd like to see it as well, if you wouldn't mind. I think it'll be fun!
Sorry took me so long to respond! I sent you a link to the story. Let me know if it turns out good!
No problem!  Just thought you were asleep after the long day! hahaha!  And I read it. I actually felt a bit nervous for you since its such a hard topic.  I thought maybe it was a really sad/weird story, so I was like "oh boy, he's really going to have to commit murder"...   And then it was an amazing story!  And it ended well too, so that was awesome!  And very clever in the twist!  But I did like it! Can't wait to see more!
Ah thanks! And that sounds so funny lol!  I'll post more tomorrow!
Hahahaha!  I'm still laughing!  Sounds so interesting, look forward to it!  And please feel free to DM me if you don't want to post it here, because I'd love to see more!  And thanks once again for the prompt!
Ohhh don't worry, I'll be posting more on here soon haha!  Thanks so much! Enjoy!
Awesome!  Awesome!  Thanks for the motivation!  I'm writing my story right now, and everytime I make a mistake, I try to look through your replies and try to figure out what you've done to improve it.   Keep up the great work!!
Aw, great to hear that!  It takes a lot of practice to perfect something, isn't it?  I'm glad you enjoyed my response!  Let me know what you're writing on!
