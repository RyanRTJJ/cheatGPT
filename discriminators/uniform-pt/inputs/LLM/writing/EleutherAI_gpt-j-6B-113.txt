It is a warm evening on the South Shore of Massachusetts. Two friends are sitting on the edge of the dock with their feet dangling over the water. They are laughing and enjoying the summer air. As the sky darkens a ship comes into view slowly crossing the channel separating the two islands. They notice the captain's white cap and the long black boat. The men are singing together as the ship anchors just offshore.

A short man, wearing a white hard hat, a black jacket and an orange vest walks along the dock and stands beside them. A woman walks toward him with the wind blowing her soft blonde hair around her face. In her hand is a man's suit. "It isn't finished yet. I made it extra long for you." She smiles and hands the suit to the shorter man. Holding the black jacket up by the sleeves, he looks at it and then at them. "It's a new model." "What about the rest of the suit?" He begins unbuttoning the jacket. "I didn't have time to finish it." "Is that so?" "Yes, and I didn't think you'd need it." The three go to the boat.

"Who's paying for it?" the man asks. "You are...but don't worry, I made arrangements." "Thanks. I have to get it ready for him by Monday" "Monday, what's wrong with Saturday?" Her lips close over her white teeth. "We can't always get everything done." "It doesn't have to be perfect. Maybe he won't like it in the end, but I've found that most of them do like to try."

"It's what I get paid for." The man stands there, unsure of what he should do next.
