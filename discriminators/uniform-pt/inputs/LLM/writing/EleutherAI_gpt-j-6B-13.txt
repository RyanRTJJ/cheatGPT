!! You, your team and your civilization have to deal with it. Who will survive?

It's just a simple game but it has interesting features:

- It has its rules on the site: "When you are looking at the numbers of aliens who have landed and the time it takes for them to arrive, it is the best indicator that we are in the right universe". But you also find out that the most important is that we have a "universal time".

- I guess it isn't that difficult because the most probable outcome is that the galaxy will be invaded but not all galaxies are like this universe because the alien will come back in different galaxies but with different numbers of invaders. What is the number of invaders that will create a universe that can be invaded by your civilization?

- There is one advantage that you have: they will not know they are in a simulation so this could be an advantage.

- I'm not the only player: I'm in the game (I'm on a group) but there are other players, I don't know how many.

- I'm curious to be part of this and I was wondering if I could find anyone else in the game, I have played and I can provide my email (if someone wants me to tell him/her how to make a connection)

Thank you for your time and tell you to continue playing if you want, please, use my account

It has an interesting story, I like the universe but it doesn't matter: the best part is to see what is going to happen.

I think the Universe has more interesting features but there are more aliens: I like this universe because there is more than one civilization and the most difficult is to create a good civilization able to survive the invasion.

I have been playing for a while I
