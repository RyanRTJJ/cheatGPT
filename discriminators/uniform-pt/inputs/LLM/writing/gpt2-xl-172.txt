______________________________________________________________ The Path To Freedom The path was clear, you just needed to follow it. They had been fighting this particular battle for about an hour when the voice inside your head warned you something was about to happen that you couldn't handle. You couldn't move, you couldn't think or make plans. The enemy was through the gate after you, and you had failed. You must run, there's no other way. "I have the first ring, I have the key to the other one. Follow me!" The figure led you inside the main chamber of another castle, and you walked in and took a deep breath. A deep breath, something you had to do, something you had to do as your thoughts were becoming so overwhelming, there was nothing else you could do. The next thing you knew, your hands came to rest on a glowing golden ring. The gate opened behind you, and it was time to run from this place. ______________________________________________________________ You can help support me on Patreon!  For just $1 a month you can get exclusive content and rewards here, and help me continue doing what I do.
In the year 2060, humanity has progressed to full consciousness and created machines that can walk upright on their own without a tether.  Yet technology has come with a conundrum: all of the machines are connected, and with all of the connections comes an inevitable need to control them. A sinister corporation called Synapse, led by a wealthy industrialist called Henry "Doc" Ochs, has come to control the entire network, and is the only one who can control the machines. With Doc controlling the network, you must run from Synapse's guards, outrun Synapse's turrets and escape Synapse's HQ.
