The world was filled with continuous dread as every living creature perpetually awaited for their death. By nobody's choice, everyone had been given one word that, when heard, would immediately take away their life. It seemed impossible that such a thing would ever happen, but after many sightings of people dropping to the ground, everyone had resigned the reality that this was their fate.



Nobody ever knew what their own word was. It was a horrible mystery of fate; everyone was waiting for the same inevitable conclusion, but nobody knew when or how it would come. People were always scared and on edge, as if an invisible force was hovering over them and at any moment it could swoop down and take them away. 

Thus, the world was filled with despair, people living their lives in a constant state of fear. A shroud of darkness had been placed over the planet, and it felt like it would never be lifted. However, one day a miracle happened. An unknown figure appeared in the sky and suddenly, no one could die from hearing their assigned word. 

The global population erupted in joy, as everyone celebrated this unexpected welcome change. Sadly, the mystery of known unknown remained, and nobody would ever found out what the deadly word was. Nevertheless, people had gained a glimmer of hope in these dark times and grateful to have been given a second chance at life. 



Knowing what this mysterious figure had done, everyone was inspired to come together as a unified people and make the most of the life they had been graciously allowed to keep.
