I think this book should be taken with a grain of salt and for reading fans who prefer mystery. This book is a puzzle piece which I thought was going to be the perfect length of the story, which was great to see. This would be a good way to break off into other stories and add some character to your main characters along the way. It's been nice.


It's interesting reading through these three pages for fans who like puzzles or intrigue or other things that might help develop them into something more or less story-driven than the more simplistic one. You have some plot, some characterization, some characters which are intriguing, the first section is some of the more interesting ones, but the one that gives me the most trouble is the next section that really is a challenge for this book, I have read a lot of this and it turns out there isn't much for these characters.


If you like Mystery of the Moon and love mystery, then this would be a great book. It's definitely that mystery, and for this book to develop to a level that would appeal to people who are new to it, I think it's still worth the money. I think the other characters are just fun to read, and the reader loves them and they take you through it.
