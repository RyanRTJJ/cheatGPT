The Sol system was once a peaceful place, full of vibrant life, until it began to show signs of distress. Scientists had been tracking odd changes in the atmosphere, subtle ripples of energy, and the planets all seemed to be under some kind of dark cloud.

It was then that the government declared the Sol system a biohazard zone and put it under quarantine. No one was allowed to enter or leave the system until further investigation could be done.

The investigation team made their way to one of the planets and found it to be in a remarkably worse state than the others. The planet had been hit by a meteor, which had caused a powerful shockwave that had caused extensive destruction. Not only was the planet's atmosphere ruined, but the impact had also caused the emergence of a strange, new species.

The scientists were terrified at the sight, and immediately ordered an evacuation. Unfortunately, it had been too late to prevent the spread of the new species, and soon the entire system had been infected. The government declared the entire system to be a biohazard zone and put it under quarantine.

The remaining inhabitants of the system had no choice but to remain within the newly formed Biohazard Zone and wait out the crisis. It wasn't until months later that the scientists were able to develop an effective method of controlling the new species, and the quarantine was finally lifted.

Since then, the Sol system has slowly recovered, although it will never quite be the same as it once was. The people of the system will have to live with the consequences of their actions for a long time to come.
