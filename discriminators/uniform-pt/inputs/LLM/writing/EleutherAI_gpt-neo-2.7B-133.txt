"What happened? The car hit us! What happened? Wasn't the car on fire? What happened? It wasn't there. It wasn't there. What happened?"

1.

His father came home from work the day he died. When he turned the corner into the living room from the garage, he saw the fire truck. He stood in front of the fire truck for a couple of minutes and then the funeral home worker took a picture. He stared at the picture for hours, before going home.

2.

During the day-to-day life after the accident, it is apparent his dad's memory is not intact. As his dad's mind rots, they both start having the same nightmare: his dad sitting on a park bench.

3.

At night he would get on his computer to listen to his dad's iPod selection. He would listen for at least five minutes until his dad woke up. He would go back on the computer to listen again. Eventually it came to him: "My dad, he always listens to my iPod. That is what he does when he's awake, when he's awake. He listens to my iPod without me asking him to."

4.

"Dad, it's late, go to bed. Go to bed. I will be here waiting for you when you wake up. You need to sleep now, Dad. Sleep now."

5.

At 7 p.m. he gets on a plane to go back to Indiana. The plane has been sitting at a small airport for two hours because the pilot does not know how to land it.

6.

Sylvia gets on the plane and takes her place beside her dad. As soon as they land, she says, "I have a question. I don't know why, but I just have a question."
