Nate was a proud lieutenant stationed at a military camp in the middle of nowhere. Despite his grand determination to be the best soldier he could be, it quickly began to dawn on him that the solitude of his post was taking its toll. Everywhere he looked, all he saw were tents, wood, and sand. It was truly a dull sight day in and day out.

One day, he noticed that the sun was particularly bright, and he decided to take off on foot to explore the surrounding area. After a few miles he stumbled upon an old abandoned house. Even from a distance, Nate could make out the shape of a piano in the corner. He entered the building and felt an overwhelming wave of nostalgia as he recognized old memories of the family gatherings he had attended when he was a child.

Nate felt an immense wave of emotion as he approached the piano and began to run his fingers over the ivory keys. He had not played the instrument for many years, but the notes that came out still felt as familiar as anything else he could remember. Nate lost himself in this moment, playing out of pure emotion as he flourished on the ivory keys.

As he played, he began to drift away and imagines what a full orchestra would sound like, playing together around him. He felt a tear trickle down his cheek and his head began to fill with all the people he had left behind - his friends, his family, and all the people that he had sworn to protect.

He reached over and touched the piano in a way he hadnâ€™t done since his childhood and let out a sigh. Nate had found something he had been missing for so very long - a sense of home.
