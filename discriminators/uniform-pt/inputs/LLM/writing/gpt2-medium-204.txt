'Three Assassinations' is a nice little read that has a ton of action and tons of surprises. It's a good time-killer for the holidays.
This story takes place between 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane' and 'The Wedding Dress'.
'Three Assassinations' is in a unique spot in the book. It doesn't really involve a girl having a boyfriend, or having a relationship with a boy because the main character is the guy.
