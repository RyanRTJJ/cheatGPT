 I'm sorry, I'm still getting used to that new change.
I do this all the time with friends. We get to a place where we laugh so hard that we can't talk.  This time, it was my dad's wife, and he's out of the country, so we could only describe it in ways I had never heard to anyone before, and they couldn't possibly understand them. It was like the characters were saying them on TV.  It's hysterical.
I think that's awesome! We need more of it in everyday life.
Yeah, but how do you define bombast?  To me that's more a style of writing, especially in "serious" writing - a literary description.  Is this bombing style part of a literary technique of using bombast a lot to enhance the story?  Is bombing style a way of describing the characters in a way someone else wouldn't understand?
Nope. It just means to write the things you're doing in a really exaggerated way.
So basically, your idea of bombast is to write in overly silly ways?
No, you're taking it a little too literal. If they wrote this in a serious way they wouldn't have described it this way.
I'm not literally interpreting it.. I'm literally quoting what's in the story!  For a description, this story is almost impossible to describe.
It's hard to describe, that's the point. It's the same as describing a meal. You write the description of the ingredients, not the meal itself. And the story is the ingredients.
This guy Bombastes!
Are you implying that the author of this story has poor writing?  What on earth has he done wrong?  It sounds *exactly* like the kind of thing I would do to my friends!!
I'm saying that the person you replied to didn't read the story all the way to the end.
