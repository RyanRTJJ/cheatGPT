It all starts with a signal. I hear my master telling me that it's time to go outside. My excitement grows as I run to the door, jumping up and down in anticipation. When the door finally opens, I shoot out with speeds faster than the speed of light.

My first destination is the backyard. I love exploring the backyard, running around, chasing squirrels and checking out all the smells. I love rolling around in the grass and digging holes. After a few minutes I move on to the sidewalk. On the sidewalk I run around, sniff every street corner, and sometimes I get to stop and say hello to other dog friends.

After the sidewalk I usually make my way to the park. It's the best part of my day! I can run and play and explore to my heart's content. I can play tag or wrestle with my friends and then take a nap in the sun. After a few hours of fun in the park, it's time to go home.

On my way back home I usually have a few detours. Sometimes I take the long way home, checking out new smells and snooping around bushes. I always make sure to be back in time for dinner though. As soon as I'm back home my master rewards me with a treat and a belly rub. 

Regardless of where I go and what I do, one thing is certain â€“ I'm always happy to come home. It's the best place in the world and I'm always grateful to return home to my master's loving arms.
