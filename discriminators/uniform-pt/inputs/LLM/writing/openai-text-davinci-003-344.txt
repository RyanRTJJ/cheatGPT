The old man felt nothing as he looked down at his arm. He had felt no emotion even when the long metal object glided against his skin, filling the shapes it had left as permanent tally marks.

It had been like that for years now. For every person he had wronged, whether it be taking an innocent life or hurting someone through evil actions, he had received a mark. At first, he had been ashamed of each new line that day, seeing each one as a reminder of his failures. But over the years, he had come to accept them, resigned to the fact that they meant nothing more than justice.

But today was different. He had done something so horrible, even by his standards, that he now had more tally marks than any man ever had. His arm was now almost totally covered by the telltale markings - each black line carrying an ever heavier burden of guilt.

He stood there for a moment, letting the weight of his sins settle over him. Then, slowly, he began to turn and walk away, never to make the same mistake again.

But even as he walked, he knew that he was never going to forget what he had done. The long, dark tally marks follow him everywhere, an unremovable reminder that he had taken so many lives. The marks never washing away no matter how many times he washed them. Even if he were to erase them from his arm - his heart - they would still be there, forever.
