Google Goes Down, Leaving Only the Word "go outside" in its Place
I would like to submit this as an original research paper for my high school English class.

A:

How about,

 The earth spinning and the sky burning up

Reasoning:

 Look at the Google homepage,  notice that at the top it has a picture of the earth and a date of "Earth Day Earth Day". If the Google homepage was suddenly taken down, it would make sense since without that website, Google's official page has no value to it. 

 As for the Google website not working, maybe they were trying out this site for the first time on Google. Imagine that the earth suddenly became a blazing ball of fire, it would make sense considering the purpose of Earth Day,  and since we don't have a lot of reliable means of communication and it's a new day, there are no real backups yet. 

A:

My original idea was to have the internet fail. 

    The internet: 
      - Is a vast resource of information

    But, with a simple system: 
      - Information is limited to 2,500 results

    And the server: 
      - Is no more than a few servers in a building

    With the internet failing, the message becomes clearer: 
      - Information is only the 2,500 results you get

Now if everyone had a message like "Look outside and you will see it's raining"

   - The internet is very useful to people living indoors... 
     Now imagine everyone was looking outside... 
      - The internet as soo much useless information...

   - They'd be spending their time looking outside... 
     (In the past, a normal person couldn't go outside... 
      Now there's no need to go
