    "For God's sake!"

What they say? They say you "may" not be like God because... God isn't "God". He's not the monster. He's not a person. He is just the darkness that surrounds you.

You think... you like to be loved? Why does that motivate this character?

You are a fool, because you always thought that if you told the person what that meant... "God doesn't care what's done, this can't change that" or "they should all go back to work at some point" or "everything should be better now" or "everything is fine now" or "well done everyone!"

Why did you become such a crazy, hateful, destructive person? Why are you like everyone else in the world? Why did you love yourself so much?

God.

God is an asshole.

(You see) Who better to do you in love than him or her?

But you love her for who she is, not for what she does.

And you're just as bad with her as he is with any of you.

Well, that's all it takes to get to that place. As I said, it's a matter of "the dark side of my soul" and if you love God enough to be like God... then you have a chance. And, if you are like God... then you can make a difference. But you will need it. And I guarantee you love Him and you will need it but to give it up and let go of him is NOT the most...

So what do you do? You accept your fate and your fate lies in peace.
