1.6.11 We have selected a new source of inspiration: Animal Life ️ (click here for a version of this story). We use data from several sources including ️ animal survey records, ️ animal health surveillance, field guides and scientific research to make this selection. ️

1.6.4 We have selected information about these five breeds of domestic cats for adoption, for breeding, for public education, in a more general way for cats to play the leading role in the care-taking of the pet community, and to make up for over 1.1 million pets over a seven years period.

We have started to work on an approach to ️ Veterinary Education Program (VEP) that will help ️ veterinarians gain more experience, especially with dogs. We will help our program grow by allowing for more emphasis on behavioral and learning approaches to the pet care and prevention of illness and injuries. We have started to look into other veterinary education programs to help our students gain more knowledge about pet behavioral and learning interventions (PEM) and the way to protect health and well-being.
