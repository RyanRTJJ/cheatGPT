This is what you'd write:

A teenager from a poor family, but one who has no plans to become a scavenger, sneaks in the back gate, and makes her way cautiously down a nearby side street. She is dressed lightly, without military style clothes, only a T shirt and jeans. Her eyes are bloodshot from the tears of the earlier bombing. The sound of the distant bombs reminds her that it could happen again, at any moment. She pauses a moment at a crossroad. The explosions from this morning are far enough away that they shouldn't threaten her yet. This was a big, close, one-time hit, a single bomb dropped right from the heart of the city. The building she was in should withstand this one.

Another noise from somewhere draws her attention. There’s the clatter of metal as someone tries to open an iron gate. She knows what will happen next, so it doesn’t take her a moment to decide what to do. She starts to run for another avenue, this one with fewer buildings. She runs past a small group of people. Someone shouts, and others respond. They’re still in shock.

She hears voices, so she pauses again, for she thinks that maybe one of them is someone she knows – she doesn’t even know anyone’s names. She has made no friends. She feels herself flush with the heat of embarrassment, shame, at not being able to bear the name ‘friend.’

She takes her backpack off and slings it in her hand as she runs down the avenue away from the sound. Another explosion. Maybe there will be more to distract her, if they keep hitting the streets she knows. She sees a man in black clothes, running, and she is reminded again that there are strangers in the city. That no matter how
