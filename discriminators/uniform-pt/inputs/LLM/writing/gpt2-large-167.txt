-------------------------- A mysterious woman comes to the town of Lakeview, Oregon. She seems to be a scientist working on a mysterious 'thing', but there doesn't seem to be any of the usual 'people' there - the odd old women living behind the shop, the one man who doesn't seem to take the time to give a damn, etc. So she comes along and tells the local residents that something's been happening. The people there seem to be... quite concerned about it. But then she talks about an old woman he has been seeing recently. Is this new thing connected to the old woman? -------------------------------------------------------------------------- From: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time [TNTJ-BOS] -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Link and Zelda are two of the main characters of the Zelda series, whose names are often used in Japanese legends. And, despite the fact that they lived for a long time in the past, the two are said to have experienced all the lives that a Zelda can have. They also live to the ripe old ages of twelve and sixty, respectively. So... how are they connected? The Legend of Zelda tells the story of Link and Zelda's adventures, beginning with Link (the boy's name in The Legend of Zelda, being that it is given in the fourth line of the game, "A boy met a girl...") following his destiny as a young hero and travelling past many lands throughout the land of Hyrule to find his beloved, the princess Zelda (Zelda being his true identity). The tale of the two young heroes takes off in the Zelda games, where Link and Zelda are usually shown as young children. There has been some controversy in Japan about whether the two are siblings. On the other hand, there have been claims that they are twins, or have been separated in a strange and terrible way, but such are to be expected when two people of such unusual appearance, who are also very different, have fallen in love.
