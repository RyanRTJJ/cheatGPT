As I watched the destruction of Earth from the view of my spaceship, my thoughts were so heavy with sadness. I had grown to love this planet and had formed meaningful attachments with its people. But now, the Earth I had come to know and love was being destroyed, and even though I knew it was inevitable, I couldn't help but be deeply saddened by the sight.

In the wake of the destruction, I saw a planet that was no longer beautiful, but instead filled with destruction and despair; and my heart ached for all of the people who I knew had been impacted by the destruction.

My final thought as I watched Earth fade away before me was that this destruction was not in vain, but was instead a reminder that no matter how small or insignificant we might feel in this universe, we all have a part to play in the grand scheme of things.

We are here for a reason, and it is my hope that despite the destruction of Earth, that the impact of our presence here is remembered and never forgotten.
