I have been writing a screenplay called The Luckiest Man Alive. Now that it is done, I'd like to publish it elsewhere, and I've decided what the title should be. 
The story I have is a kind of anti-hero. His name is Tony DiMera; he is the world's best hitman; and he is the luckiest man alive. 
His life is full of tragedy and danger: He's a drug dealer (he likes to kill people with drugs, sometimes accidentally), he's in and out of jail, he's beaten by his wife, who wants more than he can give her, he lives in a hotel with his brother and sister-in-law, and his brother's son lives in the same hotel. He works at the same hotel as a concierge, which is how he keeps his secret identity (and the fact that the hit man was a convicted felon) a secret from the people he works with. 
It's a very sad story - in a way like my own. And yet there's something hopeful and beautiful in it. 
I'd like to publish it in The New Yorker, although it may change names because of the name of the protagonist. 
In the story the protagonist dies alone at a concert, because of bad luck, when he was hit in the head by a thrown beer can. He is left behind in a crowd of people, with only the concert ticket in his pocket. 
I had a lot of help on the writing. I'm pretty sure it isn't original.

"The world's best hitman..."
Is certainly up to anyones expectations!

I was surprised that Tony DiMera got to be in the New Yorker. That's where he should go; in fact I can only imagine that the editor or editors or whoever had read this would have gone and submitted it.
The New Yorker is really the "only place," in my opinion at least, where the best hitsmen write about their profession. (That is actually their motto. Hitmen need a motto)
