____ - The first time a player plays the game, this prompt (along with four other prompt sequences) is shown on the top-left corner of the screen. This prompts can usually only be turned on to make it more challenging or annoying by using the command "/rz" which is written in the prompt text. Some examples: - Command "/rz help." - "Catch the guy on the train" - "Funny stuff happens in this section." - "The dog loves cats" - "Possesses a giant squid." The command "/rz find" will find out which level or mission this prompt's letter appears on. This prompt can typically be turned off by using the --no-sub-prompts argument, but it is often desirable to turn it on. To turn this on: 1. Select the quest text and press the command. - Once you hear "This quest is finished" from the prompt and have no more messages in that quest, press "q". 2. Now move your scrollable left mouse button. 3. Press the right mouse button over your quest area. If this doesn't work it may be because the command doesn't recognize that mouse button and you won't see the result as soon as you press it. - When you press the right mouse button over the quest area it will change the command you hear into an X response like "I found a dragon lair!". 4. Once you find a dragon lair in the level, press the "z" button to send the prompt to the server for processing. The game will then check the return codes to see you got it. This is useful as it provides the "backtrace" which tells you the exact path you just took. For help with using the backtrace for various types of backtracking, see /u/Zurch0r: "The game looks at its own backtraces for the same thing and is therefore not always complete and accurate." (Quoted verbatim from an IRC discussion on /r/pda) - The quest text will change to reflect the specific command you used to read/write
