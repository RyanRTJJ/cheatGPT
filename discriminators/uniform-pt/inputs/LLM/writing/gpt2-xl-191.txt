 You have uncovered evidence to support your belief.  You know Batman has been in hiding since the event leading up to the "end game".  You have uncovered evidence that the world's most powerful man was murdered.  You're not sure who killed him but you think it was someone from within the Gotham police department.  Who killed him, you've no idea, but you can't just stand around anymore as you realize your best bet for figuring out who killed Batman's most valuable asset has been thrown out the window in favor of the more boring theory that makes sense and isn't likely to be disproven.  Batman's "suspects" are criminals trying to take his secret identity.  You have been investigating the murder scene for weeks, making copies of evidence the police didn't collect, and piecing it all together until you have the "smoking gun" that points squarely at one person. If that theory isn't enough to get you to believe - you're a paranoid nutcase.  Batman is Batman.  There's no doubt. Anyways, I'm having trouble going to sleep as it is.  This is like a story I read in college but I didn't know the name of the author or the author's name.  This seems like it was written by a high school yearbook and I'm reading it to my son - I never knew it was going to be a book.
This would be the second time someone mentioned "I have a very vivid night dream...", I'm beginning to notice a pattern in my life. I know the author of this story lives in San Diego. She may use a pseudonym. Ahem. Anyway, this story is good. It is well written and I like that she goes in depth to explain her theories to Bruce. I don't think this story has given me any specific clues about Batman that can't be found in any of the other books on Batman. I didn't think this story was especially scary but I did take a slight chill to it. Her writing is good, her stories entertaining. As for me, I've had a very strange night dream I don't remember
