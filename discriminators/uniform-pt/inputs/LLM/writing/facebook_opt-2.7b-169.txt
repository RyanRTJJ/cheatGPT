 Bonus: How the aliens handle the humans' refusal to abandon Earth.
I'm more interested in your second idea, but first would be cool!
You're more interested in the second because you made it! :)
I just realized, if I wrote the first, it would just be too easy :P
Oh man, and I am just a dude who makes a living off of words on the internet. You're a fucking writer.
Thank you! This is exactly the encouragement I needed; this really did brighten my day. (I'm glad I inspired you, too.)
You are welcome. :)  I'm just a dude with an old house that sits a kilometer away from a forest I have to walk to get up into...
You must live somewhere very beautiful, then. I'm glad you are enjoying your home country.
I did say I was very near to forest. And yes, I have lived where I am now for over 15 years, and I have been walking into the forest for longer than that. But it is still stunning.
Oooo, lucky! It can't be that much closer to a forest? And so many kilometers away from a city... I hope it is safe and you have good people around you.
It's okay. The city is really really huge, so I don't really feel like I can complain much. And I do have a community of nice people. :)
Can you go up onto a mountain nearby?
No. I don't think my parents/family would like that too much, since I've never been near a mountain before and my mother doesn't have the best English.
I'm just trying to make you feel better, because of how long you've had to fight against the social norms and I hope you get what you want eventually.
Yeah, that's true. It's a good thing I don't feel the desire to be "like everyone else". But thanks for the kind words, I appreciate it:)
