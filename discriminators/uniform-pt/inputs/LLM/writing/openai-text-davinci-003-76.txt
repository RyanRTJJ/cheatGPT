Once upon a time, in a world filled with endless possibilities, a man by the name of Peter was born with a special power – the power to consciously snap his mind as many times as he wished. He did not realise the consequences that each snap would unleash.

At first, the snaps merely brought about minor powers – the ability to move objects with his mind, for example. But he soon began to crave more, and so he snapped his mind more and more often, which unlocked a greater and greater range of powers.

These powers, however, came at a price. With each snap, Peter became more and more mentally unstable, eventually spiralling into a deep depression. With a snap, he could be the strongest person on Earth – but he would also be crippled by his mental illness.

And so his life became a balancing act. How much power did he need and how much would he be willing to suffer for it? Even then, he knew that one day his illness may overtake his powers and that balance could be lost.

But no matter the consequences, Peter never regretted his snaps. For he knew that the mental illness was a part of the power – the reality that comes with his superhuman abilities.
