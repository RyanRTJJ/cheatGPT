The beleaguered people had kept up their tenuous plights for hundreds of years, struggling to remain free and resisting the various oppressors who would take away their rights for selfish gain. They had weathered hardships and plowed through times of scarcity and times of plenty, keeping a flame of hope alive for future generations. They watched and admired the power of the nations near them, particularly the one who promised them the future of a land of freedom and opportunity.

The beleaguered people needed someone to lead them, to show them a way to stand up to their oppressors and restore the rights that had been taken away. An outspoken woman, who had experienced the injustice of the system first-hand and dedicated her life to the liberation of her people, quickly rose to be their leader.

By mobilising strikes, protests and rallies and with the help of the neighbouring nation, the resistance evolved into a mass movement of people. The beleaguered people were determined to win; their fight was motivated by a sense of justice and freedom that had been denied to them for too long.

Finally, on a fateful day in May of 1945, their efforts paid off as the European Union was formed.
