I'll take a different take than the answers here.

 We're seeing from each other that reality is subjective. People assume there are objective facts. What we observe as facts, like that you don't make me cry, and I don't make you, is only objectively true is you can find that statement in our agreement (that we are agreeing that we don't make each other cry). So it's not like we're really observing a different reality, it's just that our reality doesn't allow us to find these truths.

This seems to work well as a story. Or at least some of the parts do.

 A person from another reality is going to come to your reality and expect there to be facts, but there's not. "Why didn't you find this when you were looking?". You probably can't explain it.

You could start that your Earth is from a different place in the Quantum Multiverse. When you arrive at your Earth, you notice people having problems with the Multiverse. You start looking for a way to escape, as someone else is also looking for a way out.

 The Earth is the one on the left and you escape to the Earth on the right. You can't go back, though, because the Multiverse is closed. That's a bit of a spoiler. If you look closely there is an "entrance" in the Multiverse that I can't explain. It only has one door, and only one person ever goes through the door. 

In your story there is no "parallel universe" which is fine because the Multiverse is a fiction.

 It is a fiction that makes Quantum Mechanics and the Multiverse make sense. I have a theory that a scientist working on the Multiverse decided to make Quantum Mechanics a little easier to understand by creating a fictional universe which the fictional universe was part of. I don't think this fictional universe is an alternate-Earth or a parallel-Earth; it is just another part of the Multiverse. (This may be a bit of a theory too.)

It is my opinion that this new fictional universe is very
