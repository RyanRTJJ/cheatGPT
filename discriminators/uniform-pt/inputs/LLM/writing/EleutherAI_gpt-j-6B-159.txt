I don't really know what to make of this one. It's too short a story to write and it doesn't really have a point. So I could probably delete it and that's probably what I'll do before I post. Oh well.

Prompter:
"How far are you willing to let your secrets go before they destroy"

This is my prompt. I had it typed up for a contest but I got sick and barely made it. The best I could do was this short little piece with no real point of it all. I'm not sure it really counts as a story but I can't find it to delete. So I'm leaving it up here.

Prompter:
How far are you willing to let your secrets go before they destroy yourself.

I tried to make this story long enough so it actually counts as a story. Short as it was, I managed to make it sound like a real story. But now you have to take the story and edit and shorten it, to make sure it gets the points it needs.

Now, go and check out the rest of the stories, and look for things that you can fix to make them better.

A man that had been having a bit of trouble in the past few years was getting up to speed in the world of technology. He had an office job but also a few side projects that provided him a means of being financially viable. In the past those that knew him said he would do anything it takes to earn money quickly. If he gets the chance to run his hands over a new product, he can never say no to it. In fact the longer the better. That was how he got involved in black market trade. No one was really sure where it originated, but by his time it was common knowledge that certain people knew a lot more than anyone else thought.

This was why the man of the world would sometimes run into situations that he wasn't even sure were right, even though he knew it as a means to make money.
