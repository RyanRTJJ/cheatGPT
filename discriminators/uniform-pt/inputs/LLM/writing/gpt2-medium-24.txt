 That way, people will think you are mocking alcohol. In English we like to name all people we like through a series of qualifiers.  So here's who I am really liking:
It's nice to know that there's an artist on earth that, perhaps, I wouldn't have been aware of if I looked online. He's very well qualified, and makes something that's fantastic (see his recent work here ).  It can be incredibly hard for non-literate readers to recognize that an artist, like us authors, can produce what's really good.  And it's nice that he takes the trouble to use a name from a tradition as obscure as Italian Renaissance art, a very specific history about a specific art form.   That's a cool title.  I'll be trying that with something on alcohol.
But it sounds like he might not be interested in alcohol, too: If you know what kind of artwork he uses, you'll understand why.
In terms of other literature titles, I haven't had a chance to look at something quite like the above  until this weekend.  This guy wrote a book called   The Last Good Man  ( I like it here for the great plot ).  No one seems to have noticed I'm reading it.  But he's just another good artist whose stuff I'm interested in.  I'm enjoying his characters.
This was one of the many reasons why I decided to read The Last Good Man  first.  It's a book so close to the sort of stuff I'm a sucker for.  It's an artist whose books I'm drawn to.  I want to know what it's like for him to write this book, and what it's like for people to experience the same things he does, and then analyze it together with him.
My first impulse will be to tell them to shut up.  There are hundreds of artists out there like him.  I'm sure he writes stuff that feels familiar to at least
