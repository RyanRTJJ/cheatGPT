My dad came home one night with the biggest grin on his face, a huge grin. And to make it even better, not long after, he started working extra shifts at the convenience store he'd owned for almost 30 years.

We had the biggest argument that night. One of the strangest things about it was that I still don't know if my dad and I hated each other. Probably, but I'm convinced I knew something we didn't. That night I finally figured it out.

My mom knew exactly what was going on that Christmas, and she asked my dad, "Why did you bring a gun to the party if you don't even want any guests?"

"I don't want any guests. And it's a stupid party anyway..."

"Do you want friends or not?"

And he replied, "I don't need any friends. My customers are all out of work."

No, we didn't agree, and that Christmas was a miserable experience. My dad never apologized, despite my asking for it, and he never apologized when I was 12 or 13 and we spent the afternoon arguing.

Later on the subject, one day my dad said something that caused me to wonder: What was the difference if I was a 7 or a 10?

The difference is this: The 7 is a person who has trained to become dangerous, and the 10 is a person who just is dangerous in the purest sense.

We all measure people by the standard of their ability to be dangerous. And here's the shocking part: The standard for someone to become dangerous is a 10. In the real life, most people in the world are only able to achieve a score less than 7.

This does not mean their actions and actions are always "good" or
