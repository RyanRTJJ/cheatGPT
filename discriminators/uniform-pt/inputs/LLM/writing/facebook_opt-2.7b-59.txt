  "Flight" means you don't think it could possibly work but you want to try. "Fight" means you really want to do it.  Post your response as a comment.  Be sure to include who you are and why you believe the story will be effective. I'd love to take a look.
I was just thinking about that and it's so obvious:  People are different, it can't work.  He didn't make an account and I don't think there's an option to submit a story as a guest or not.    But damn it would be so cool if it just randomly appeared in front of him - in the form of a story where you are the hero - and he decides to do it after all.
Hah, well, as a reader I can't force someone to take any chance of trying the story. As a critic, however, it's important to make sure not to give away any of the story in its initial moments.  But yes, a "fight or flight" situation would be perfect for a story.
True, it would be ideal for a story - but I am saying he would have to actually *start* the story.  There's no prompt for that, no submission option for that situation.
If there were a way of submitting a story and then leaving another one for the reader to submit within the same post, it wouldn't be nearly so much of a problem. Maybe I'm just looking for too much. ;)
Just don't give away all the meat, then you won't have to worry about that problem :)  Just do some basic things like use paragraphs and tell us who you are and why YOU believe the story works.
And put your email where you want your manuscript sent to.
