 This way we don't have to spend our days re-writing our own personal story every time we take one of these things down.
"Press Ctrl-Z" is pretty cliche.  Everyone knows you run the cursor over and press the Z-button in order to save changes you've made, no matter how crazy.
The "Save" part implies that the "save your work" means "press enter a dozen times to save the work."
Aye, there are many ways to read those sentences, but in any case, a zeroth-level super-hacker would know to save as jpg by clicking twice on the document icon.
I would assume they keep a copy locally on the drive too, just in case.
My computer has a "File", "Choose Disk", "Save", "Save as" function built into it.  I don't have a drive anywhere nearby. :(
You can just print it out to a blank page.
You know, that might actually be the most convenient way to save any document of mine.
Haha, yeah. It's great. My printer makes a small file every time someone prints their page. I've had no reason to go there over the last few years, so it's pretty great to have it on print screen ready!
I love this thread.   Printer/scanner/fax.  I have all 3 of them at work.   Printer is a Dell printer all with wireless settings etc, scanner has a built in wifi, fax is attached to a server, but has a fax terminal in it, with a small monitor that can print an image.
What kind of a beast are you using?!
I think it's a Dells xps with wireless and the wifi is on via the wireless switch, I can't remember the model just have a picture of it.  I need a new scanner, I've bought so many over the years!
