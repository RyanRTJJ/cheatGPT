 So many possibilities.
I would, but I'm a girl, so it won't fit as well. You could also look at the story of the girl in the picture...
Yeah. I'm not sure what I expected. But for some reason I've gotten a few ideas and it's interesting. Keep at it. Your writing skills definitely seem to be better than some of mine.
Thank you for the encouragement and inspiration!  Also, I can't write poetry worth a damn in English, and I suck at poetry. So I have never considered myself a good writer. But now I'm going to take another stab at it. Haha
Well, it's not like you have to write poetry. I'm just throwing out some ideas. Anyway, write what you feel. There are plenty of other reasons to write poems than your gender. Maybe you aren't sure if you like to write poems or not. Keep on writing and writing and writing. You'll figure something out, and you'll figure out how to make it interesting.
Thanks for taking the time out to listen to me ramble. I'm a nervous and clumsy woman. I don't quite know the first thing I'm doing all the time. I am not sure of anything. But I'll keep trying. There might be hope.
I've heard it said that we have "tremendous potential" if we're not too busy squabbling with ourselves. Your feelings and thoughts might be worth it, even if only to yourself. At best it might get you to do something that you otherwise wouldn't do or at worst it might make you happy. Keep doing you. I know that sounds cheesy, but it's so important.
I love cheesy statements. I'm gonna take that to heart. :) Thanks again!
No problem. I hope you do great. I'm happy to be of assistance.
