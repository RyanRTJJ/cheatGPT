I woke up at seven o’clock this morning. I turned on my computer to find three voicemail messages, two from my mother and one from my dad. (Mom’s were the most annoying, with various bits of commentary about Dad.) They had all talked to me the night before, but they were just trying to start up conversations. Dad left at the end of message number one.

After I had erased Dad’s messages (there were several), I tried to log my voicemail. A machine asked for my password and said it was rejected. I re-entered my password and the message repeated, asking for a new, stronger password. When I told it I didn’t have one, it gave me a number to call that told me the password if I didn’t know it. I called the toll-free number, and a voice on the other end told me the same thing. It was very annoying.

I was tired of having to talk to the robot, so I logged off. But then my computer wouldn’t let me go to sleep. There it was again, that message I’d just heard. It was not an automated message; it was asking for my password again. I told it I had changed it. It wasn’t asking for my password. I had gotten a new password. It was asking for a hint. That message was very annoying, too. I told it to fuck off, and it gave up.

I got up and went to the fridge. After that, I went to work. The next thing I know, I’m working on the Internet, reading an article on the web about the war between the machines and the humans. I got halfway through it. My father, I found out, left messages on our machine several weeks earlier. He started off asking for news about the war, then proceeded to complain about our housekeeping. Every time I erased one of his messages, he left a new one. The man likes to talk; he
