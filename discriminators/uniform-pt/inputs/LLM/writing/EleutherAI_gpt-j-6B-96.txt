A:

You have an asteroid that hit on this day?
You have had a catastrophic war?

Then you would have:

You have had a catastrophe that has been announced to you, your day of reckoning.

 For those who don't know, the world did experience a massive asteroid hitting the Earth two weeks ago.

A:

In a word:

 Armageddon

Because...

 This question doesn't come in exactly the form you wanted (like, I have an announcement I need to make to you), I'll just stick with explaining my rationale for the title.

Yesterday, the world heard an announcement that a massive asteroid would hit the earth today.

 This world is Earth, and in this day at this hour, a huge asteroid is supposed to hit.

Only it didn't, and now everyone is feeling super awkward.

Everyone is feeling super awkward at the fact that they thought they had until tonight to prepare themselves for the impact.

 The Earth is still there. The asteroid is still going to crash into it at its "destination" destination.

You have an asteroid that hit on this day?

No. This is Earth, and the asteroid is supposed to hit Earth.

You have had a catastrophic war?

 No. This is Earth, the asteroid isn't supposed to hit, and everyone is trying to figure out why something is hitting them instead.

Then you would have:

You have had a catastrophe that has been announced to you, your day of reckoning.

 That's what this world has been experiencing for the past week. You've heard the reports on the news about it happening today (at this hour in this world).

A:

How did everyone lose this day? 

Most people lost their work, it's the same in Germany.
