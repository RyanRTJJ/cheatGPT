Summary: After being bullied relentlessly since he was an infant, Zachary Farkas discovers a mysterious book that tells the story of what it's like to live and make decisions in a totalitarian state. "I don't really like the idea because, at least from a practical standpoint, I don't really think the idea is going to work," Zach says. But in a final gesture of empathy, Zach takes out a knife - but this isn't his first time. The book "I'm scared because I can't be myself around people" starts with a series of events that lead to a world where the government can kill you the minute they catch you reading an anti-government book, with a whole world where the police exist on the fringes but can be called in to do anything. As the story spirals out of Zach's control, he finds himself fighting for his life with everyone around him.
