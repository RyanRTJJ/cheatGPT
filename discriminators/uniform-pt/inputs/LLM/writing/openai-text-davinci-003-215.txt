The scientist had worked tirelessly for years in the lab. His team of researchers had finally created a serum that would alter the genetic makeup of all human beings and give them the exact same brain as his. The plan was to create a perfectly level society and do away with the age old problems of inequality and unfairness. 

The plan had worked. Overnight, every single person on the planet had the exact same brain. Intelligence and creativity became obsolete, for everyone thought the same way. Those who had been skilled in music, art or other forms of creativity found that their talents no longer had any purpose. 

That was the start of the downfall of humanity. With no new ideas or creativity the human race began to stagnate, unable to make any progress or develop in any way. People became bland and boring all sharing the same interests and thoughts. Life, which had once been filled with joy and colour, became a dull and grey monotony. 

Time passed and with it, the world grew dimmer. People had no motivation to improve their lives, and global unity and coexistence that had once been so hard fought for was forgotten. Humans became cold and emotionless, no longer capable of feeling passion, love or anything else for that matter. 

The downfall of humanity was complete. As the world grew colder, darker and devoid of all meaning, it became apparent that the scientist's serum had done nothing but cause destruction and devastation. Unity, it seemed, did not bring equality - it only brought destruction.
