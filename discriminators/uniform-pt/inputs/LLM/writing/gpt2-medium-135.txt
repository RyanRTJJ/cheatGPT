*Some of these prompts sound very familiar to you. That's because they were all written, or at least inspired by, your own struggles. Some have been passed on to you by friends and family. Some came together for the first time on the blog or in a email conversation. And some inspired those who've never met each other before to make that connection. We're hoping that if you know of others to share these prompts, you'll feel like you've contributed something along the way.

They're there to inspire, and to empower, you to feel more empowered. Do your best. And don't stop thinking. Have great days! —Laura | New York | July 11, 2016 • 8:48 am to 11:59 pm, Thursday, July 14, 2016

It reminded us of a certain part of us that seems to run through all of us, including just a tiny subset: Our human instinct of survival—or, as it's often referred to, our "survival of the fittest." This idea of "survival of the fittest" has helped us survive things—like war—totaling in a few thousand years. It also has helped us survive the many
