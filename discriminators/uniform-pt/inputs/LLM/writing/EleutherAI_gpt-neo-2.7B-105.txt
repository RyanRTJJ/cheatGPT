**Trouble at School**

Once you find the zone, you want to do one of several research projects on it that will focus on the zone as an interesting character in your science textbook.

Ask the teacher for this research plan: (1) the zone's origin story from the city's founding or (2) the biohazard zone's origin story.

Asking the teacher for this information sets you up for getting your own ideas and for asking questions after the class or before a large test on it.

You probably already know that the biohazard zone comes from the former Soviet Union. The city planners who created the zone were trying to protect citizens from dangerous pathogens and biohazards from animal waste.

In the US, the zone is named after the first Soviet Union national guard unit, nicknamed the "Sol" ("Sun"), and the area is now called the State of North Dakota. One official reason for this is because North Dakota shares the border with the Soviet Union.

Before you work on this research plan, you need to complete your biohazard zone research.

**Predicting the Zone's Fate**

You need to know at least the following about the biohazard zone:

**1.** What are the current status of the zone?

**2.** What environmental, human, and animal factors make the biohazard zone vulnerable?
