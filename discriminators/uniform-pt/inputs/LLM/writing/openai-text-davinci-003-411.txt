It had been a few years since I was elected President of the United States. I had been settling into my new home in the Oval Office, familiarising myself with the machinations of the job and the various traditions that had been held since the tenure of presidents past.

Unsure of what to do and desperate for answers, I bolted out of the Oval Office determined to get to the bottom of this mystery.

I tracked down my predecessor, the 44th President of the United States, and asked him about the big red button I had discovered. He smiled, knowingly, and replied ‘That button has been there for decades, since the times of JFK. Unfortunately, its secrets died with him, and no one knows what its for’.
