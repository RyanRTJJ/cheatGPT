 It could've gotten worse if the campaign had been more transparent. So you don't want to be looking for "Go Inside" messages?
It turns out this tactic works pretty well, but just make sure you're going to be using this tool when you're creating your content.  This could be as simple as clicking the "create story" link in the left lower left corner and then saving the content it would've just run into on the page. Note that while most people don't create stories, in the past the only times people would create them was when you needed to build a new page or get the first of many stories to appear on your page. Go ahead and create an article using my script.  Or write one for me.
Go inside, click on the "about" item and go to the title page if you'd like to start creating stories.
Once you're doing this, press the "link" button.  That's it: click on the "about" item and click on the "about me" option.
The link will take you to the article created, once completed.  You'll then be asked to enter your email, as expected. Just like in the previous example, if you haven't had the previous page created for you, it's not your first time, and if you don't click on the link then Google will redirect you there. It appears as a banner and you've reached the article's goal.
After you've made this, you can go back on to your original story to see which piece you've built.  Please email my script if you use this method on others. I suggest going with the more open-minded approach, but there's something that looks like this:... The first thing this will do is set the URL for The New York Times web site, to www.gizmodo.com.  When you click on the link, the URL changes the text that would have appeared on your page. I have a solution below to show you how to do this
