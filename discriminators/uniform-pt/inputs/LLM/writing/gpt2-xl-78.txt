Â You can see the outline here. If you can write a post with the following format; A: [SPOILER ALERT] B: [SPOILER ALERT] C: [SPOILER ALERT] D: [SPOILER ALERT] A story centered around a shapeshifting race that is now trying to survive on our planet, but are continually attacked. What happens if your character is part of that attack?
This is a great world because I have been wanting to do more vampire/werewolf/mythological/monster stories with vampires (who, while a bit strange in many ways, are still very familiar). What I enjoy about the world is how it is both fantastical and grounded in a real history. In fact, they aren't really human, but the reader who has a hard time imagining vampires and werewolves acting the way they are is reminded that they do. The setting is great because of how easily a world based on fantasy can be adapted to science - it isn't too hard to throw off a story about the world of Pern. There are a few things that I am considering, however, that would make the world much better: The Vampires: If the story of the world of the setting has a bit of a supernatural component, then give us vampires. If they aren't in the center of the story, the story will just feel that something's missing. The Werewolves: If the story has a little bit of werewolf involvement, give us wolves. I've thought long and hard about how best to explain the transition between werewolves and vampire, and this would be a good place to do it. The Gods: I'm a big fan of the Pernians' religion, and the gods that are the foundation of this religion, but they seem just out of place in the setting.
