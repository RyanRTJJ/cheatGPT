  Write out your character then come back and see what you could have done with it.
That's a really cool concept, though I'm not sure if it'd work. Thanks for suggesting it!
Yeah there’s a lot to think about. I just remember seeing a similar prompt like this when I started my channel over four years ago! (I had this idea on a plane to Europe) and thought it would make an interesting character and world builder.   Feel free to come back and post after you’ve put some time into it. You could also try asking on here too and get some ideas as well.   As always: best of luck! (and great channel!)
Thank you so much! :) I'll be sure to come back for some inspiration. And maybe ask others! Haha
If you need any help with anything (creative) or just questions regarding your channel or your video I would love to help if I can! (not that I'm a professional or anything lol, just that I have a pretty good knowledgebase for stuff like this)   Feel free to PM me anything, or shoot me an email and I'll get back to you when I can :)
Thanks, I already have one question if you don't mind answering! :D I would love some tips on marketing, since I haven't been able to figure this out so far. I've been trying to send links to people all over the place, and it's been such a failure as far as I'm concerned. Any advice with this would be great! :)
I would suggest first going after friends and family and friends of friends. Or whatever your main audience is. That way, you’ll get the most of the leads and if you don’t like the results, you move on to the next one.
