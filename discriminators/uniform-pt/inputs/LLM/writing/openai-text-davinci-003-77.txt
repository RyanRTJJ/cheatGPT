The world was in shock. On one ordinary day, people around the world tried to access the most used search engine—Google. Yet they were met with a stark message - "Go Outside." This brief, yet powerful message had left millions stunned. They asked themselves and each other, why was Google down?

Rumors and theories quickly began to spread, but there was nobody available to give answers—or even acknowledge the problem. Many experts speculated that it was a malicious attack or a simple technical issue. Others suggested the idea of a message from an advanced alien species. Though all these theories had their merits, the truth remained a mystery.

With the sudden disappearance of such a popular platform, people suddenly began to realize how dependent they had become on technology and the internet. Families began to spend more time together, talking, playing games and going outside. Schools began new projects focused on getting students away from technology. Even businesses had to get creative to stay in contact with their clients.

Eventually, the outage lasted for weeks. Almost everyone, besides the tech-savvy, had given up searching for an explanation, and moved on. Then, on one sunny day, out of the blue, Google was back up and running. People opened their browsers with excitement and logged in, but what they saw was far from what they expected.

In place of the usual search page was a simple message. A reminder to us all that the world outside of technology is beautiful and sometimes it is worth stepping away from our screens for a moment to take it in. The message read, “It’s time to go outside.”
