Dear_________,

I hope this letter finds you in good health. It's been a while since I've seen you, and it's been even longer since I have thought about you. I have so much I want to say and it has taken me so long to put it into words. 

I don't know if you knew it, but I always admired you, from the moment we met. I was attracted to your confidence, your strength, and your independence. I wanted to be just like you, and still do. I'm sure that you were completely unaware of how I really felt, and I'm so sorry for that. I was afraid of what you would think and how you would react if I ever let you know how I felt. You were so brave, so honest, and so real, that I felt I could never measure up.

I know that so much time has passed and I'm sure much has changed. I'm sure you have loved and lost, and have soared to new heights. And I'm sorry that I wasn't there to be a part of your life. These past years have been a whirlwind and I have neglected so many relationships. I am sad that I wasn't able to be there with you.

I wanted you to know that you will always have a special place in my heart. I just wished that I was brave enough to tell you when we were younger instead of writing you this letter years later. 

Take care,

Your old friend,
