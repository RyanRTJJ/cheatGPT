 What will you do? Run away? Or try to stop your parents from destroying your most beautiful, yet most dangerous trick?
That actually sounds interesting.  Can you elaborate?  Also, I'm the writer of this prompt.
I'm not a writer and am still trying to figure out what I'd do.  I'm sure the story will do the talking ;)  If I were you, I'd stick to running.
Not a writer, either. But I'm intrigued, nonetheless. How about writing about a young man, perhaps? Or a woman? A family? A secret?
Write about a man, in fact.
I'm actually going on a road trip this weekend, and I had the same thought. You've got a new fan.
I feel like I should warn you that he'll probably only write like 250 words, but they're going to be *fucking* long.
Yeah, I noticed. This is an invitation for us to do the next one too! Maybe then we can do it every Thursday! What do you think?
Just do it! It's a lot of fun. We'd be glad to, but please don't ask in advance, we're really busy!
Thanks, that's really kind of you! If you get a chance, could you comment on my other posts? I'm a little shy, and it could help a lot.
Sure; I'll try to find the time. I'd love to read yours.
There we go, it's all mine now
Sweet! There are more, so please, come back here every now and then and check them out. When I have more time, I'll start on some more!
