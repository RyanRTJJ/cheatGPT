--------------------------- *How to finish: *Use the object (it's up to you whether you name it or don't), then tell me what it is. *I can't tell you exactly how to finish a story! Just as each person is unique (and as much as I'd like to think each reader will be unique), the best way to decide what to say in the story is not to discuss it, it is to tell the people in it what it is. I hope this helps someone out there who is wondering how to write a story without getting overwhelmed by it all. I have a bunch of ideas to share with you in the next few days, but for now I will be sticking to answering your questions without giving too much away! Please let me know how it is working for you, I would love to hear from you! --------------------------- Thank you for taking the time to read this, it is my joy to share this with you. I hope it is an easy read but please don't judge me if this works for other readers! It is not intended to be the perfect description of a particular scene here, I simply wrote it so that you might get a better idea of the types of questions I get when I do stories and I could use your help with that! This should hopefully help you to think about what you are trying to tell without getting too overzealous with it. Thanks again! -Sara D (sadylol)
