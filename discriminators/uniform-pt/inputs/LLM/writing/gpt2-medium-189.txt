The final challenge is the quest for enlightenment, by which I mean to accept a god's name and to believe in the Light side of things. With your character's full knowledge of God, they don't need to accept much of anything to reach the enlightened part. I've added instructions on how to acquire this power for your character during and beyond the Quest to Enlightenment quest. If you don't believe that you can receive this power from God, you might choose to do your own quest at any time (but for now, this is what you do). Once you have your knowledge of God's name, ask any other character to accept it as well. Ask any other character if the name they wish to accept will become God's, and ask that they believe in the power. Any characters that fail to accept it will drop out of the fight and be returned to normal. This quest doesn't require you to have knowledge of any particular God. You can also complete this quest by calling a number of non-human gods to a local area near Quelaag. As mentioned above, you'll need to accept a number of other names such as: Darkstar, Woden, or the Emperor (only one at a time). I've included a number of suggestions for possible names that follow the "God of War" or "Deathbringer" pattern as well. Once you've completed this quest, ask any others you know for the word or symbol (and you'll also be given a reward). Then ask any other characters if they wish to accept the name on their own, even if you've already accepted it. They don't have
