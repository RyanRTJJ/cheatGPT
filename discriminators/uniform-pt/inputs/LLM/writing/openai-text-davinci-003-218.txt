Barbara sighed as she looked down at her daughter. It was clear that the 7-year-old had been up to something, though she wouldn't say what. Barbara took a deep breath before asking, "Sweetheart, why do you ask if you're a monster?"

The little girl looked up at her mother with deep, dark eyes, eyes that seemed to convey a sadness far beyond her years. "I heard Jeff calling me a monster yesterday. He said I was too ugly and mean to be human." Tears began to fill her eyes as she spoke.

Barbara felt her heart breaking in two. No child should ever have to feel like this. She wanted to reach out and wrap her arms around her daughter and comfort her, but she was afraid. She was afraid of how her daughter would react if she found out her mother was a monster too. "No, honey," Barbara said gently, "you are not a monster. No one can make you a monster unless you let them."

She brushed away her daughter's tears and looked into her eyes. "You're a beautiful, brave, and kind girl," Barbara said. "And no matter what anyone says, that's never going to change."

The little girl smiled and hugged her mother. As they stood there, Barbara was reminded that even monsters can be loved.
