 I was taught to believe the stories I was told about my father and about the people I lived with and of my friends, for example how my mum was a hard-working waitress and my dad owned a shop.  There must be millions of such stories - not enough, they are so much better ones and some of them are still hard to tell.  One of them that my mum tells me about when I was about 12 is about a war - the same war that my father was fighting in and won - that took place many decades before I was born.  They tell me that the war that raged on for weeks and months, and killed thousands, never ended but that some of the deaths were those of men who were too old to make it to the trenches or were executed.  This was the war I was told when I was still a little girl.  That my childhood had been made much brighter by these stories.  But how could that be true?  My mother says that most of the story of the war had been made up.  Most of it was not made up by her father as he told her.   Where did the real stories of the war get started? Why did they start? How did the stories get turned into stories that my great-grandmother, my mother and I have been told for years?  How much of what happened to her, my mother and I never knew? The real story is what my great-grandmother gave me about the war.  A very painful story.  A story I am ashamed of. What I learned of it is that there has been a war before and probably will be a war after.  The war that would start again many years after my great-grandmother's story and after the great battles I could still not remember, never will.
