 Example: I am sitting on my bed, and I have two candles: the lighter on the right, and a lighter in the center.  Edit: if it helps, you need to describe it in second person (I am the candle).
Okay, so you mean it could be "I am sitting on my bed, and I have two candles: the lighter on the right, and a lighter in the center"?
I would recommend leaving out the "my" and making a simple,  unemotional sentence that can work for both "I am me, sitting on my bed," and "I am sitting on my bed, and I have two candles: the lighter on the right, and a lighter in the center." It's pretty easy to imagine that both forms are possible, especially since you're saying "the lighter on the right" and "a lighter in the center" can be read as independent phrases as well.
That could work, thanks for the advice! :)
No problem. Also: You might want to check out some online English lesson sites. I would suggest looking up grammar exercises, writing prompts, etc. on /r/writingprompts, and then check out some grammar guides that look up English sentences with phrases you're looking for.
Okay, will do so! Thanks for the advice!
Good luck!
I'll give it a go when I get home! Thanks for the advice :D
Good luck!  Edit: Also, /r/whatisthisthing is also a good place to ask this question. It will probably be removed because it's an obvious/standard thing to ask, but they're generally very helpful people there
I'll give it a go there too, thank you :D
Sure thing! Good luck!
I'm going to start writing it up right now, can I have any ideas or tips on how to add/remove things? Thanks! :3
Just do a google search for the name of the thing. Usually it's spelled a couple ways: usually by spelling how and then removing the l. For example, for "dog", you could do "dog" and then the "
