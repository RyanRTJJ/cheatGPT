 in a moment of clarity before going back to review the rest of the vault's design. Once you have the full designs, the rest of the team finishes designing what the finished product will be. Your role here is to review and oversee. You also have to decide whether or not the rest of the team gets to participate, or if Vault-Tec will actually make the product. Your role is that of Director of Security, a title that grants power in the vault that you can share freely. You have ultimate authority even over the production and testing of the product, including how the vault is organized (by structure, size, etc.), who gets to see its contents, which projects will be included, what will need to be built, and how much time will be spent on the project. As you work, the idea will emerge from the vault. The only time you get to take action is during the project's design stage. You will take notes in the backseat as the design is being developed and will make final decisions on the items needed to execute the finished product. You are charged with making sure Vault-Tec's design is implemented in the final product. It can't be improved upon or even changed.
You'll get to see how a vault works. In the first three cases, you'll learn from actual people working on top of technology - engineers, scientists, and even some of the engineers. After you've worked through the design of the vault's most essential functions and created a fully functioning design, you'll hear the arguments of both sides of the Vault-Tec dispute. While most people want to make sure Vault-Tec gets to make more money and continue building the greatest vault ever, many also don't want to see their creations destroyed, so they argue that Vault-Tec should provide more safeguards to prevent potential destruction.
