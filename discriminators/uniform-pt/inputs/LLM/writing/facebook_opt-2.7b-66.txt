  It helps to show that this person is special to the dog who is going to die with him/her. You should feel some connection to them that goes beyond just being a caregiver.  This story should have some adventure to it. Keep your dog safe.
I am working on a few already. They may take a while because I tend to be moody but I do plan one. It is quite an emotional ride I have had. Thanks
You should write about a dog you feel a connection to and care for. Make that dog your guide. I'd read it.   Good luck!
Ok, I'm going to write a few. I'll let you guys know when I finish it
Thank you for the write-ups!  Your writing gives me the chills some days. You're definitely one of my favorite storytellers.
Yeah, this dog reminds me of my boy dog that died a few months ago. I feel like I have never been loved so thoroughly, but at the same time all my other pets have also been very special to me. So you hit the nail on the head a lot on this one dog. But I also have to add the whole guardian angel thing too. Thank you :)
You're welcome! Thank you for sharing your stories!   I'm sorry for your loss of your dog. I remember what it feels like to lose a pet family member.   I have to work right now but if I don't get out of town in time I'll PM you a little later.
I don't think I'll be able to make it to work either so I don't mind if you hold off :) thank you
Gotcha :) Thanks for your patience.  I don't suppose that you could PM those stories anyway? I'll be busy all night.
Hey, sorry I
