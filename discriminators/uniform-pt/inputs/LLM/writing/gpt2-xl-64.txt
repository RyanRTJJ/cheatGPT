 A single mushroom cloud enveloped the entire nation.  As a result, a "clean-up" campaign was initiated.   New Mexico's towns and cities were evacuated of anyone who was thought to have been exposed to plutonium because officials didn't know exactly how badly the fallout was going to hurt them.  The only evidence of this massive effort was the nearly complete lack of radiation in the landscape.  For the first six years after the bomb, a secret scientific program was going on at the Department of Energy in Nevada. During this time, the nation was still under a strict moratorium on nuclear testing.  The Department of Energy's Dr. Robert Murphy was secretly conducting secret medical research concerning the effects of cosmic rays.   After years of research, Murphy was convinced that the effects of the bomb's radiation were indeed not as severe as he had initially believed.  Murphy was later asked to develop the radioactive isotope Plutonium 239.   He came up with a technology to purify it from the fallout.    By 1950, the New Mexico radiation levels had dropped to only a few microradiation-per-hour levels.  In addition, the radiation had killed nearly all cancer cells in animals.  The last test, "Fat Man" conducted on July 16, 1949, sent 100,000 tons of plutonium-239 into the atmosphere over the entire state.  The first atomic bomb was much more than an experiment.  It was a global threat.
