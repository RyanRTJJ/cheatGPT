It was a Tuesday morning when the police first received reports of the grisly scene at James’ apartment. Inside, they found the body of a young and successful lawyer, slumped against his desk. On the desk, in neat block letters, was the strangest suicide note anyone could have imagined.

The note read: "The world is so vast and filled with so much beauty, Why would I want to stay here in this prison of a life? Goodbye." 

The police, baffled by what this could possibly mean, decided to investigate further. They discovered that James was a brilliant and successful lawyer, with a loving family, supportive friends, and a promising career ahead of him. Nothing could be found that would explain why he would take his own life. 

However, further investigation revealed that James had a unique hobby - collecting rare and strange objects from all around the world, mostly from online auctions, flea markets, and thrift stores. His friends said this is what made him truly happy.

The final piece of evidence that the police uncovered was a strange music box with an etching of a whale on it, a note inside that read, “Escape the prison of life, unlock new horizons”. This strange music box proved to be the key to understanding James’ suicide note.

The police came to the conclusion that James had been attempting to escape his mundane reality and create a new one. His suicide was his last attempt at finding a new horizon and unlocking a new world of beauty and wonder. 

Years later, the strange suicide note still resonates with many people. They often find themselves wondering why James felt so confined to life or what freedom he was searching for in death.
