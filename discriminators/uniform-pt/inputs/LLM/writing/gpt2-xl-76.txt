____________________ The story's end is a nice touch and adds more to the story. It's also usually easy enough to guess: You know what they all think of him, but you don't know what they all fear. You might be able to guess if they've seen someone killed, but not what they saw. This way we have more room to expand on the details. ____________________ If the reader is left with more questions than answers, give you a few more: What are they afraid of? What's the reason for their fear? How do they react when they're told to do something dangerous? ____________________ A character in a story is often a character you'd probably want to be friends with. Even better though is if they seem like friends. You can usually use this for the antagonist, too. ____________________ The writer can also use this for an enemy. The character can be the cause of the fear or the reason for it. ____________________ The writer should go with the mood in the story: if it's a suspenseful story or something that's really going to happen, this is a good time to use the word "scare." ____________________ Don't go completely off the edge here. Something a character fears can be terrifying. It just makes sense that the character is afraid of something that's very real. ____________________ Sometimes you want to have the reader feel something rather than describe it. If you add a bit of drama or tension by getting them to imagine how the character would react, that's perfectly fine. You don't have to make them feel anything, though. ____________________ Don't worry if the way the story's ending reads is different from how you imagined it. You're letting the reader decide what kind of world the characters live in. ____________________ Just like you can use the "horr-ray" to scare the character, you can use the word "horror" to scare the reader.
