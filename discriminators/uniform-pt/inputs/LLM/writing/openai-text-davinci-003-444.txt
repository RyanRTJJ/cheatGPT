The universe was in chaos. War split the once unified galaxy, tearing apart planets and races in its wake. Everywhere felt the strain of the conflict - but in the midst of the violence, something unexpected became apparent.

The advanced alien races that populated the galaxy, who had once seemed so powerful and intimidating, had a surprising limitation. Despite their incredible technology, none of the races had the capacity to kill.

For the first time since the war began, a ray of hope shone for peace. As the alien races began to look for a way to end the conflict without any bloodshed, a new plan emerged: the aliens would have to find another species who could fight their battles for them.

And after much consideration, they settled on one specific species as their ideal candidate: the humans of Earth.

The aliens sent out a call to Earth, offering the humans a chance to join their cause in exchange for advanced alien technology. With much reluctance, the humans accepted the offer, and soon enough, Earth had its own part to play in the interstellar conflict.

The humans quickly proved their worth, showing the aliens that the capacity to kill was essential to keeping the peace. It wasn't long before the alien races had to recognize the humans as vital allies in the war effort – and the humans had a newfound appreciation for their own power.

The humans' success in the galaxy was a hopeful sign of a better future for the universe – and a reminder that even the most advanced civilizations need outside help to achieve true peace.
