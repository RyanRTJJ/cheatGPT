 You have been living a lie since you grew up and don't want to live another day in that hellhole.  Your only friend is a powerful psychic who shows up to comfort you in moments of turmoil, but your life is constantly shaken now that someone you thought that you could count on has changed, or that a new problem has come up.  What are the next two days going to bring? What is your plan?
I hope we get a story inspired because we get one every year.  This isn't one you'll be able to read in a year.  This is one an artist can put their heart and soul into and one that we can imagine happening with our characters if we are writing in the first person, right here on this page instead of in a story, or maybe out in the real world.  That's what I love about this.  It's not just about me writing it.  I'm not going to try to copy another artist and write my own story based on her.  I'll show off who I am, and show you what I can do with it.  You write a story based on a prompt, and then send me a link.  A day or two later, someone who's interested will tell their friend what you were inspired by.  That's the best part.  If you don't see an option that inspires you, be sure to look over an upvote on /r/story prompts or Reddit.  If you want to write a story based on this prompt, go right ahead.  Write whatever you want.  And you can use the tag for anything from sci-fi/fantasy to a cute and silly light hearted story.  I'd encourage you to make it a good story, and have fun, just as I want you
