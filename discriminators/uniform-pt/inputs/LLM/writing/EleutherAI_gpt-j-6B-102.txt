 What do you write in the pad of paper?

For example, in my "pad of paper" I write out each night what I ate for breakfast. I have been stuck on this pad for several years, and have finally created a story!

### **Chapter 6 â€“ The Best Laid Plans**

### Prompt: Create a story that involves plotting. Include an event that is not planned.

If you were a great plotter in a movie you might set the scene in your own life, for example set the scene with a character you are writing. It would probably be the same character in each scene, but each scene would show a new aspect of their personality.

For example, you might have a main character which you have planned out for years or years in your head.

It could be a person, a place, a situation, an animal, a person, or some object that is real or imaginary or of your own creation.

For the main character you might have a plan (you are the author), but you leave it till the last minute in this case.

Or one scene might have a completely different plan from the main plan.

Or you might have a scene that has 2 different plans.  
For example, let's say there is a main plan and then an emergency plan. If the emergency plan comes into play you may have a change in the main plan.

You can plot your whole idea, or just make a little piece of it up.

Let's go to example one:

I am having a character created for my movie. He is a young man who thinks he is invincible. He looks for challenges and never backs down, but he is really an unhappy dude, constantly worrying.

I will let you be the author of your plan.

If the character I'm writing has a friend
