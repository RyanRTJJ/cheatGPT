The Evil Gene I am not much of a writer; I know that for a fact because at a little less than one year old, I wrote myself over a thousand lines of short stories. These were all written at such a young age because they were based loosely off either the movie, ‘An American Tail’ or one of my favorite fairy tales, Puss in Boots, and they were all good. But none were anywhere near being good enough to compete with the classic work of Edgar Allan Poe or Robert E. Howard or any of my other childhood favorites. I was never one for writing in a vacuum-- I believe that writers should go beyond writing their own stories to create new stories, and the more complex the story is in my opinion, the better.
This collection of stories is my chance to show that I'm old and stupid enough to be published! Here's to hoping that readers of H-Net will appreciate this as much as did my schoolteacher/nanny, Mrs. K. Broughton. I know that she may not be as fond of my writing as I am of hers.....but I can't deny that she did inspire a good portion of my own writing.
Thank you everyone for your support and encouragement, and for reading this far!

I sent her one chapter of this story, and then I called a friend who lived in Southern California and asked her for some advice. I told her about what
