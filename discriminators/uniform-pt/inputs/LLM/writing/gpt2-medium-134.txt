 [ TH ] [ TT ] The darkness is very real. I think there is a very good reason for this, I think we should look at the reality of it. It's almost like you don't have to fight it, the darkness is just there to draw you in to being with the world.

The "S" Theme of "The Phantom" by Zeboyd
The same theme is played every night in a show called "The Phantom." A puppet show is a form of entertainment for children using the puppet show or play to generate excitement and a sense of adventure within themselves. Many children who participate in these events live their lives around a puppet show because it brings them together. Another reason why children participate in puppet shows is so they can feel part of the show. The puppets have their own personality and personalities to give them their charm, and therefore their unique sense of adventure that is part of the attraction of these events. In this particular show I believe you can listen and learn from the puppets because they talk about their characters as if they were real children. A puppet can speak to a child in front of a crowd so they can get the feeling of being a real, honest person by their behavior and speech and they are always trying to be the person they know they really are. This is something I like to think is the reason why audiences of puppets seem like they are so real that it makes them feel better because they are seeing what puppet shows, puppets, and puppet shows are based around.
