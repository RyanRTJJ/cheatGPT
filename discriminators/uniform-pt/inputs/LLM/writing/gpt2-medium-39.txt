It was worth it though. The enemy I'm fighting is in fact the very same one who killed my father; someone who isn't on my side at all. Even though I haven't seen or spoken to him, this feeling of isolation can't be explained away; this is the feeling when you see your parents killed, and you go and pick them up off the ground. I'm the one who took the risk of confronting this thing after all. What the hell did it want? I don't know. All I know is, I want to live. I've got to find you. As a child, I looked up to my mother and had visions of her smiling from deep into my heart when I looked at her with tears in my eyes. She's been gone for a long time now, and my father has always kept her around, though I don't understand why. I was only 13 when I met her. It was during that special lunch in school when we shared our first feelings about our mother. She told me that she wanted to give me back my father; that, although the war had devastated the region, she hoped I would find him somehow. I felt a small bit of grief when I thought about my mother, and what that might mean; but I don't have the luxury of judging people by looks rather than on face value. Now I'm not sure. I know there are things we cannot see, which in order for my heart to grow organically, I have to begin looking at them. What I don't know are the implications my eyes must have upon the world. Is they a way for me to express my feelings? Or
