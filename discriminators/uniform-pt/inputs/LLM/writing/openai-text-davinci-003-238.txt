There was once a man who was determined to cheat Death and achieve true immortality. He poured every ounce of his being into devising a way to cheat Death, and after many years of hard work, he was triumphant in his mission.

The man was filled with pride as he flaunted his newfound immortality in the face of Death, offering a mocking laugh and an arrogant smile of triumph. Gathering his remaining prized possessions, he continued his now immortal existence with a feeling of invincibility, convinced Death could never reclaim him.

But then the years turned into centuries, and the centuries into thousands upon thousands of years. The man experienced all the world had to offer, saw every sight and every emotion, and knew every thought anyone ever had. He had soon grown tired of life and in his loneliness and boredom eventually realized that immortality was a mistake. He longed for mortality, a dream that was now forever out of reach.

He became bitter and resentful, feelings that amplified over the years, until he no longer saw Death as his enemy, but as a beloved friend he could never reconcile with. He saw mortality as a long lost dream, something that he could never achieve. So he mourned for what he could never have and what he could never be, left alone in an empty Abyss with an eternity of regret in his heart.
