_______________________________________________________________________ The Story: *A dark shadow follows. A young man with dark hair falls, and he sees a vision of himself in a time where society has collapsed. The vision gives him more strength. He finds a place to call home. The place he calls home is "Lust Land." There, on the first floor, he finds a town, and an army of his childhood friends. It's a peaceful time--the town thrives and lives on its own. But when a few people become infected, their powers and intelligence give them a new strength. This leads to chaos. The two friends who were cured of infection are given to a mysterious man named The Master. As he becomes stronger, he wants to control mankind, and the people he comes in contact with become like him. But does it all happen so swiftly? There are secrets that remain mysterious even after this time. And he is not the only one with dark secrets. The world is torn apart. Only one person survives, The Shadow.

My father also came up with the title, but it is still my father's original title. What inspired to do the episode? The story is the same as in the Flashback: The Shadow. Jean-Marc is a storyteller and script writer. He is my inspiration for picking up Jean-Marc's story again. This time, I had other ideas. What did he contribute? It wasn't easy to write, but it did become easier the more I read it. What was the main creative moment for this
