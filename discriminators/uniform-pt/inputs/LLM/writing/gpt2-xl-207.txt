 Why did it become so dark?
Lets look on this photo from early WWII in New Orleans.  Isn't this perfect, the sun is shining, trees are popping out. Why black and white we might ask?  Well the answer is that a few days prior to this picture's release in the city, a bomb was dropped over the city.  The blast created a blackout.  That day, New Orleans was black to the world.  After the city returned to normal color, all cameras were switched back to black and white. In fact, that's what we were doing before this blog.  You see, black and white photos have always had value, they've been used in science for years.  They are considered "ancient" and "ancient" photography.  You know, this kind of photography. As we know black and white photography was in use when the photo came out of the camera.  Why did black and white become popular then?  Well in the beginning it was to prevent the spread of disease as a color photo would show something else that was a deadly germ.  It wasn't good to expose yourself, even when your friend's grandma or grandfather showed you something.  No, it would show something much more valuable for all of us, the beauty in it. And now, as science advances and we can see for the first time what's really out there we are even realizing that black and white photos are much more helpful than we thought.  The beauty in them really goes beyond beauty it's healing.  This is when the black and white photography goes from a special treat for old ladies, to a treat for everyone.  What should I know about black and white photography at this point? Black and white photography can have a real impact in your life and it should not be ignored.  Yes, it is a dark background that can be used for both beauty and health, but as technology evolves it gets better and better, so
