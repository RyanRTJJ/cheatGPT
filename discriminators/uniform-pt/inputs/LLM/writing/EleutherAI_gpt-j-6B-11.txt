This year’s big movie adaptation based on a young adult book, “Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,” was the last in the popular young adult dystopian sci-fi series “Maze Runner” which originally began as a series of articles in the “Wired” magazine as a science fiction article. The first “Maze Runner” book received a movie premiere in 2010. The last book, “The Death Cure,” by James Dashner became the second “Maze Runner” movie. With a budget of approximately $33 million and a run time of two hours and forty minutes, “Scorch Trials” was the second highest grossing opening weekend movie in 2015, after “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

The movie was set on a massive prison, a place where they sent prisoners that committed the most dangerous crime in the dystopian “Glazer Zone”. The society’s main leaders are called the Glazers and they are the only humans that appear to exist in the world. Humans and other living creatures don’t actually live in the world but in domes called the Walls throughout the wasteland.

The prisoners are called “The Scorchies” and they are prisoners that got caught and sent to the “Pipeworks” where they work on special machines called the Scorcher. One of the machines is a massive “Scrubber” that is used on humans. The entire world and society is organized around a food that is called “Screw Eggs.” They are hard to make but the people in the society crave them. In the original series, people lived for generations eating a diet that allowed them to live a very long time. In the “Scorch Trials,” humans are only able to survive in the human world for four years before living in the Walls. Everyone has a code name and everyone in prison has a number. (A-6309-3
