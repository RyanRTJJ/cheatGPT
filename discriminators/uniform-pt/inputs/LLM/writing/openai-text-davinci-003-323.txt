In those 10 seconds, time seemed to stand still. Liam heard laughter echoing in the distance and somehow felt deeply connected to it, although he was completely alone. He was on the edge of a cliff, looking out over the sea, overcome by a sense of peace and tranquility. He glanced down at his watch and it read 10 seconds, right before the sun set over the horizon.

In that moment, his whole life flashed before his eyes like a film reel â€“ the good, the bad, the ugly. He thought of all the beautiful moments he had shared with his friends and family, the anguish of the more difficult times and yet, the strength he had found to keep going. No matter what life threw at him, Liam always found a way to remain strong and look forward. 

The time was up, the sun had set, and Liam knew he had come to the end of that 10 second time span. He realized he had come to the end of his life, and he was at peace with that. He smiled, a quiet kind of joy filtering through him, and he knew he was ready to take the next step.

Liam closed his eyes and stepped off the cliff into the sea below. In that moment, he felt an immense sense of release and freedom, knowing that the 10 seconds lived, would never have to die.
