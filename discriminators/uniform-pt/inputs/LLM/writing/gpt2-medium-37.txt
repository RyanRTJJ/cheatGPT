 All jokes of the future take place within the past, no matter the outcome.  If you go past the end of the second person, there is an obvious reason for that.  All jokes at the end of the second person take place within the present.  That is pretty lame. So, in other words: I had to figure out a way to make these jokes both take place within the past, and within the future.  The answer was,  no problem.  The best joke here starts with a good story idea, and ends up finding its way into a great story.  We are all storytellers, after all.
As soon as you hear "If there is an X in the future that is also Y, that could mean anything from a nuclear explosion to a giant meteor shower,"  that is not a good future-joke.  How to make "I am a writer, and there is X in the future where X is Y, and this could happen, and this could mean any one of the following  things":  •The X could be either X or Y.  The X could be both a giant meteor and a nuclear explosion.  The X could be a nuclear explosion and a nuclear explosion.  These are all bad, in my opinion.
•The X could be anything.  You could create a fictional world with every kind of thing we create, including nuclear explosions.  We could invent them and then turn them into jokes.  We create jokes that are stupid because they are silly or stupid because we create stupid jokes.  The jokes of stupidity are bad, because they are bad.  The jokes of stupidity are also not as funny as other jokes because they are the silliest.  These all suck, but they are not bad, and can be the basis for great things.  It's the comedy of absurdities and alliteration that is at the heart of a writer's job.
•The X could be something we just assumed to be something real.  We have "a bomb went off in
