A table, two chairs, a glass table.

You can also answer the question and start a new story by imagining something completely new. Or you can take the answer (and create a new story without it) and include it in your latest manuscript. Or you can include answers in your novel and revise the answers. The important part is writing interesting stories on the fly, as the story unfolds.

If you think you have some better story ideas that aren't based on this prompt, please submit them, but if you keep writing and you don't see them in your story, write another one based on the prompt. (See Tip #28 below: Don't be shy about submitting!)

Tip #28: Don't be shy about submitting!

Every writer will see stories they would love to write and they have a right to write them. However, there is always room for improvement, and not every story can be a blockbuster hit. So it is possible to submit your story to the World Wide Web's largest collection of stories. You can find stories from writers worldwide and even some new ones from readers. Don't be intimidated by how hard it is to get a story published or to write one in the first place, but if you do it, do it right. Writing for the Web takes a while and it pays off!
