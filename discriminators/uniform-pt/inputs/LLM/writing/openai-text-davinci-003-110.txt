Today started like any other day for me; I got up, had breakfast and then drove to work. I work as an accountant for a local company, nothing too exciting about it. But it does pay the bills. 

As I drove to work, I could see the evidence of the superheroes and supervillians who frequent my city. I've gotten used to it by now, but it still can be a bit unnerving.

Everyone else talked about how amazing it must have been to see all the action first-hand.
