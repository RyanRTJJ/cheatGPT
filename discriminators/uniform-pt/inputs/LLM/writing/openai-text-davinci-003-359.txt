The town square was abuzz with energy and anticipation as thousands of people came together to witness the second coming of King Arthur, who had been absent for thousands of years. Everybody waited with baited breath to see if it was true, if the legend of the magical sword in the stone would be fulfilled.

As the second sun rose in the sky and everyone watched in hushed awe, the sword in the stone suddenly appeared in the center of the town square. Not a sound could be heard except for the rustling of feathers from hundreds of birds who had also gathered to witness this moment.

Thousands of people moved to the center of the town and lined up one by one to take their turn in front of the stone. Naturally, you were one of them. Your heart was pounding in your chest as you stepped up to take your turn.

You grabbed the hilt of the sword and tugged with all your strength, expecting it to easily come out of the stone. But what happened instead was unexpected--- and shocking. The blade of the sword broke apart in your hands.

The second coming of King Arthur had failed!
