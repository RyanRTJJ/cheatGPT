 
"I've Got the Strength"  
By Jack Shuttlesworth

_One Sunday morning, I went down to the front gate with the rest of the neighbors. The street was crowded and people were milling around_.

_When I reached the gate, I saw everyone gathered there. Most of them stared at the ground and didn't know I was there_.

_Some of the neighbors said a prayer for me and everyone joined hands around the fence. I didn't know that they really had my best interests in mind_.

_As we got ready to be prayed over, I heard several women from our block of houses shout, "Hey! We already prayed for Shuttlesworth."_

_"What!" shouted one of the black men. "You said everybody needs to pray for Shuttlesworth! You can't pray over an empty head."_

_"I'm glad the prayer was said over an empty head, Shuttlesworth. We can still see if you're empty_." _This comment brought on another round of boos and jeers from the other Negroes_.

_The following day, people would always say that the people who prayed for a while in the streets were just fooling around. But I know I was not_.

I have said some of this before. Not all of it. But if I could be as sure about everything as I was about this: That I will not let these stories die because I have known how to tell them before... and I know how to hear them now. That I will not let these stories die, I would never worry about anything else in my life again.
