The sun was beaming through my bedroom window, warming my face and slowly pulling me out of my dream. I was having a vivid dream, like always, and this one was especially unique. I was flying across a beautiful blue sky, soaring between the clouds in a way I had never experienced before.

It felt so real and I gradually started to forget the vividness of my dream and the reality of the morning began to set in. But something was strange. When I looked down, I realized I was still soaring through the beautiful blue sky I had been dreaming of â€“ I was actually flying!

I glanced around in amazement, not sure of what was happening. And then, something even more miraculous occurred. From up above, I saw a familiar figure on the ground in my hometown. She had the same dreamy gaze and peaceful aura that I had in my dream.

It was my mother, the person I had come to visit in my dream. Immediately, I noticed that all of the emotion, feelings and surroundings started to coalesce into one. I was merging reality with my dream and all of the experiences seamlessly blended together.

The view from up above was absolutely breathtaking and I realized that this is where I belonged. My dreams gradually merged with my reality, and I was finally free to soar in the sky with no fears or limits.
