I had been working on the same project for my whole life, and that project was to create a time machine. I knew it was a little absurd - being able to travel through time was something reserved for science fiction, surely - but I did it all the same. I wanted to go back and fix something trivial, if only to prove that it could be done.

I worked for days and nights on end, using all of my knowledge of quantum physics, mathematics and engineering, until one day I had created a working prototype. It was crude, and wasn’t quite the sleek design I had imagined, but it worked nonetheless.

I was trembling with excitement as I stepped inside the time machine and pressed the big red button. I was suddenly thrown through time and space, and suddenly I was back in the past. It was exactly where I wanted to be - the day before the trivial mistake I’d made so many years ago.

The mistake had been a small one - I’d left a window open on a rainy day which had caused a few pieces of furniture to get wet. But now, I was here and I could close the window before it did any damage. It took a few minutes, but I did it, and immediately I could feel my sense of relief.

I stepped back into the time machine, pressed the red button once again, and soon I was back in the same lab I’d left. I stepped out, feeling a little lighter. I had done it - I’d fixed something trivial in the past.

I closed the lab, shut off the lights, and went home for the night, elated at the success of the project. I had created a time machine
