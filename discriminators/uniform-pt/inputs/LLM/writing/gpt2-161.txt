T-Mobile CEO Anthony Legrand says he's been making some push to convince the American people to get used to roaming carriers and mobile networks. This is something Legrand said in his recent appearance on CNN.

Legrand and others are proposing expanding roaming for new residents and expanding service for American residents. This is the "mobile to cell plan," the AT&T plan, with free, unlimited cellphone service, and it's a plan the American people have said they want since they were told to "live on the same network as a customer." Legrand and others say it will be more profitable to "unify and re-open our wireless carriers and customers into one wireless service." This is one of the last big promises the American people will be taken through by AT&T and other companies to take advantage of roaming. This could make it attractive for AT&T and others to expand American carriers, and AT&T will have no choice but to try. The AT&T group, which spent several years lobbying for the American people to switch to the current plan, has failed to show that it's willing to accept wholesale roaming for US residents and any carriers that want to expand. We're hearing at least two major carriers have reached out to the AT&T executives to consider expansion. We've asked them why. Let me know where you can take them on the phone. We have a press release if you think it's worth it. T-Mobile also says that the carriers have committed to making this free plan available to the public within three years after they start offering it for US residents. But the AT&T executives said that this could mean the end. They say: In the next year the carriers might decide to roll out a roaming plan that they like. And this doesn't mean that there's any change. Here's the thing about the American people â€“ this is our world, it's your world. Everyone knows it's not that hard to find a smartphone to live in, but we do what we've always done by offering this free plan for everyone.
