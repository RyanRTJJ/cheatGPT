_____________________________________________________________ I see her today, sitting in a corner. She doesn't understand why the nurse's so upset. Maybe it's because they called you a criminal. I think she understands. We've all done these things. She tries to hide under her blanket. She doesn't want anyone looking her in the eye. _____________________________________________________________ It's one of the last days in your life. _____________________________________________________________ All the rest of my friends are already dead. _____________________________________________________________ You've been gone in four years. _____________________________________________________________ I don't ever want to see you again. You're a disgrace. "And that's your fate?" "You should try to be better than that." "I don't think I can." I don't mean mean to, but... Look, it's the same old story. I got in trouble the night I got into trouble. It's the same story, every time. [ TT ] I think I've come to terms with it now. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I should have listened to the nurse more. I should have listened to the guards. Maybe I should have, I don't know. I have lost the courage to look for you. You're gone, my best friend. So it's time to get on with life. I'll just close my eyes and be grateful I won't have to look at you anymore. I hope the night was more than a dream to you. _____________________________________________________________ Look, we all suffer and some of us die horribly. What we do to other people is none of our business. What they say about us? It never really matters. Maybe it doesn't matter. There won't be any other people like you. All you can do is try and understand and try to make the best of what you have. You'd be doing a lot better if you had a good prison cell and someone who knew how to take care of you. I can't imagine how you've been feeling. Maybe you shouldn't have been in prison in the first place. You probably get out
