 
My answer: It will have to be a war story, though it won't be exactly the same as the real thing, as the author will be too busy with other storylines to have complete access to the original aliens' weapons.

Chapter 1

We are the aliens. We have come from outer space to conquer the Earth and take it and everything within it.

I stand before the assembled aliens. They all have similar almond-shaped eyes, similar triangular jaws protruding slightly beyond their chins and similar black hair and black eyes. None of them look up when they hear my name but each one moves to look at me now.

They don't need to look to know who I am.

I am the world's first alien champion, known as the "Earthling." It took me over a hundred years to perfect my artificial body, and now I stand here, a tall humanlike being with blue skin, silver hair and a silver cape, ready to fight for humanity.

My father was the first alien brought to Earth: he came out of the stars from the distant universe, where his home was. And here he is, my father. He's a tall, gray and bald man with wide shoulders and a wide, flat face with thin lips.

My mother, whose name is Ayan, came from an alien planet with the same appearance and who gave birth to me inside me, and is my second mother. My father is my adoptive mother, an older alien from a planet somewhere closer to Earth. Unlike my adoptive mother, my adoptive father is a good and loving man, but he is a lonely alien with more responsibility.

The rest of my family come from the distant universe. My mother's sister is also an alien and came out of the galaxy, and my father's sister was his mate, but she was killed so they could be together in the universe. My aunt and uncle are two aliens from outer space, with two daughters
