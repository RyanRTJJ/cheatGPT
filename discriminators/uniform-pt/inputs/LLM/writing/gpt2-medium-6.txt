------------------------- It's time to head to school! ------------------------- A teacher brings you back to school. You have no recollection of where you were, but it's hard to tell, considering you've yet to get out of your usual routine. What's your "normal" school day? What did you do all day today? Your teacher seems determined that you will be happy and forget about everything. However, your teachers want to figure out how you're going to make friends in this weird new day, and if even a part of your life is going to be saved. You take note of this student's eyes, and try to act funny to prevent her noticing you. When will she remember today?
The next day, you can't recall any of whatever you've studied, or tried to study. You can't figure out what was important to do today or what didn't count. In fact, you know that it is not as important, and if you get frustrated at some point in this new day, you decide to write about it. Your teacher finds you with an interesting poem, an old book with a bunch of other things you want to talk about, while explaining to her class what they can do with it. Since you cannot remember the topic or the words you want to talk about, they don't find it very useful at all. A week later, you look through this poem again, and suddenly realize how far down the rabbit hole this could lead you to. ------------ School break? ------------ As you read about how long it takes to break into some new location, you realize that you also need to put in a lot of overtime in school, and then go on a long road trip. It's not all fun and games, but at least your school life will be more interesting in the long run.
