 (Hint: The eyes belong to me.)
(You are amazing)
You're amazing <3  Now that I've typed it out and read it, the plot has evolved. I can now see your eyes are not my own. In fact, all of your actions are directed towards me. The fact that other people share your eyes is all the more mind blowing considering you have no idea if you are the one in the room. You could be anywhere, and that fact that there's another person in the world who shares your eyes is more disturbing.
(Wow I still can't believe you did this I love your stories)
I know right! Thanks ^^   Now, just for some reasons I've never seen this prompt used before, we are trapped in this tiny town, with no way of getting out. We try to escape our bonds through the streets, but there are far more of us than there are of them, so we use what we've got to survive, and you are one of them. You have one life to live, if you survive you'd either kill me out of revenge for what you have seen, or just let me go.
(No I won't kill you I have nothing to do with all of this)
Good then, so if you ever find yourself in a situation similar to this again, I'd like to be one of the people that help you escape.
I will keep that in mind but first of all I need to tell you that I hate you. If I don't hate you I want to. If I don't hate you I'm probably going to have to kill you anyway. Why don't you show up in the comments section of the story and maybe at some point I'll have a conversation with you?
No problem, and no, no need for an apology, though I think you know why I do this.
So is this the beginning of a long standing rivalry between us?
Well, unless you do something about it...
(Oh hey we finally get to talk)
