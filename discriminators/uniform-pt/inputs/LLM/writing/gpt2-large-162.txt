How many words from the first poem do you have in mind?
How do you write and use the last word of each sentence? You can use a sentence's first and last words within the same sentence, or within a single paragraph. You can use the first, middle, and last words of each sentence and the same order by putting the two together—as long as, of course, both are used within each sentence. You can also use the first word of each sentence only if the last is a coordinating word, but even then each sentence may have a completely different order of sentence beginnings and endings.
In one of my poems, "The Death of Choropleurope," a monk sings a love song to a woman. In the first line in the poem, "Death of Choropleurope...," a monk asks whether or not the woman is death; in the second line of the poem, he describes how he has taken the two things the woman is and then died to her. There are other examples, but these two are pretty clear examples. There are several ways you can arrange your poem, and you cannot write the first part of a poem while the second is being written. You must decide how the poem begins when first writing the rest of it. For example, if you're writing only the first five lines, but your poem is about the death of two things at once, that's a long poem. You don't need to finish until you've finished your first sentence or two. To learn this trick, write "The Death of Choropleurope" with a capital A to show that you've finished the first paragraph. Try it!
What do you do when a poem breaks down?
Most poets don't have a good or any way of knowing when a poem is being difficult, even though they are trying in earnest. One of the first places you get advice is usually from other poets, and that advice can be quite negative—such
