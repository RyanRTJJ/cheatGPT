It was the biggest press conference I had ever been involved with. Dozens of reporters were sitting in the audience, cameras flashing every few seconds as they recorded all the details of the event. I had been preparing for this moment for weeks, and my palms were clammy with nerves.

Stepping up to the podium, I could feel the anticipation in the room, like a thousand eyes were fixed upon me, waiting with bated breath. Taking a deep breath, I adjusted the microphone and began to speak.

I announced that, after careful consideration, I had decided to make no comment on the issue before me. Immediately, the room erupted into a cacophony of noise. Reporters leapt to their feet, shouting questions over one another and demanding an explanation.

One of them yelled out above the rest, "This is going to be front page news across the planet!" That calmed the room down a bit as everyone tried to wrap their heads around the magnitude of what I had just said.

I quickly stepped away from the podium, leaving a stunned audience behind me. I had said the one thing that could make this story global news, and I could feel the waves of excitement rippling across the planet.
