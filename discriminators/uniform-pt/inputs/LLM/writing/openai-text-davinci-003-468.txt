Once upon a time, in the great emptiness of the universe, there was a single drop of blue light. This drop of light shone from all directions, stretching out and around itself until no darkness remained. As the light continued to grow, eyes formed within it, and a voice that echoed from all directions spoke out:

"Let there be light, and let the stars be born and the galaxies be formed."

The light continued to expand, and soon enough, matter and energy came into existence with it, forming the basis for all we know today. Planets, stars, and galaxies began to take shape, dancing in the light and spinning through the cosmos.

As the light continued to grow, creatures of energy and matter soon began to form as well, and at last, the universe was filled with life. Creatures of all shapes and sizes, of light and dark, filled the galaxies, bringing with them new possibilities.

Days became years, and years became decades, and ages passed as the light of the universe remained and the creatures explored further into the depths of the stars. Eventually, the light began to die down, and what was left was a vast expanse of stars, planets, galaxies and creatures, together making up the universe we know today.
