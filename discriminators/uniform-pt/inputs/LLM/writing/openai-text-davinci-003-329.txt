Dear Me 10 Years Ago,

I have to start off by saying that everything I am about to tell you may come as a shock – but don't worry, you'll end up exactly where you are supposed to be.

First of all, I want to let you know that you are still you. Everything is the same – your values, your passions and your ambitions. Though you're about to embark on a very different journey than you anticipated, don't worry. It's this journey that will bring you to the life you are living now – and trust me, it's a good life.

Ten years ago, you were about to graduate from high school. I'm writing to give you a glimpse into what happened after that. You left your small town and moved to the city. It took some time to adjust – living in a big city was overwhelming and intimidating but it was also exciting and fulfilling. After you finished college, you landed a job you never thought was possible. It's a job that allows you to help people, to make a positive difference in the world, and it brings you immense joy.

You've also grown in ways that weren't expected, making mistakes and learning from them. You don't have it all figured out yet – no one ever does – but you will come to understand that that's part of the beauty of life. You'll have your highs, your lows and everything in between – but you'll end up braver and stronger, and you'll be so proud of who you are.

So embrace the fear, embrace the uncertainties, embrace the moments that may not make sense now. Embrace them, because in the end, it will all be worth it.

Love,

You
