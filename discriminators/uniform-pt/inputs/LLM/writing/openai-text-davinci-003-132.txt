Alice woke up to the sounds of birds chirping outside her window. It was so peaceful and tranquil, she couldn't help but take a moment to appreciate it all. She stretched, letting the warm sun’s rays hit her face and the gentle breeze whisper its secrets in her ear.

Today was the perfect day for a picnic. She got out of bed and went to her closet to find the perfect outfit for the glorious day. She put on a white summer dress and some sandals, grabbed a basket, and headed out.

Alice had a surprise for her family, so she made her way to their secret spot in the woods. Her family would come here often during the summer to have picnics and play games.

When Alice arrived at the secluded spot, she saw her family already there. She could see the big smile on her mother’s face, and the joy in her father’s eyes. Her siblings were laughing and playing in the warm sunshine.

Alice reached into her basket and pulled out a beautiful bouquet of wildflowers she had picked on her way there. She presented them to her family and they all clapped and cheered.

Alice and her family spent the rest of the day lounging in the sun, playing games, and eating delicious picnic food. They talked, laughed, and enjoyed the perfect early summer day.
