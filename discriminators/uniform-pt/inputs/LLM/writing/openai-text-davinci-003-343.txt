Jane had known Dave for years. They had grown up together, and even though they had teased each other when they were younger, as time passed, their friendship had blossomed into a sort of unspoken understanding.

But something had changed in the past few months and Jane couldn't quite put her finger on it. She had noticed that Dave had been more distant, and it had only gotten worse since he had started spending more time with his new girlfriend, Lucy.

But still, there were times when Jane thought that something more was going on between them. She would sometimes find him looking at her with a sort of longing expression, and other times she would catch him glancing away when she entered a room.

It was during one of these moments when Jane finally broke her silence and asked him, "I dream about you once in a while. You suppose that means anything?"

Dave's gaze met hers and for a few long moments, neither of them said anything. Finally, he let out a sigh and said, "I think it might."

Then, in a moment of quiet courage, he leaned forward and brushed his lips against hers, confirming to them both what both had known for some time.

They spent the rest of the evening together, talking and sharing their feelings for each other. Finally, as the sun set, Dave looked over at Jane and said, "You have to know one thing: I think of you every day, and I dream about you even more."

Jane smiled and in that moment, she too had her answer.
