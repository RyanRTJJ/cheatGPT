The people of the planet had been groaning under the boot of oppressive regimes since time immemorial. But I, the great and powerful world leader, had just changed all that – I had conquered the world and brought tranquillity to every single corner of it.

At first, I was overwhelmed by what I had accomplished. But then I quickly realized that I was faced with a unique and unprecedented opportunity to bring about positive change to the entire world. 

My first order of business would be to rid the planet of poverty, hunger, and disease. To do this, I would invest in health and education initiatives, greatly invest in developing nations and provide global economic aid. In addition, I would promote peace through diplomatic agreements, and swift military action to protect the safety and security of citizens.

Next, I would ensure that everyone had access to clean water, enough food to eat, and adequate housing. I would revamp the taxation system to ensure that citizens of all income levels paid their fair share.

Finally, I would ensure that everyone in my new domain could exercise their basic democratic rights – freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to vote. 

By making these changes and others, I was sure I could make sure that no one lived in fear, oppression, and exploitation. I would create a world filled with unprecedented prosperity and global cooperation. As my first act of unquestioned world domination, I chose to bring about a peaceful and harmonious world that could be enjoyed and shared by everyone.
