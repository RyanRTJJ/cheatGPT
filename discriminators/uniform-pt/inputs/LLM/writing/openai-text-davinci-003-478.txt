Once upon an aphrodisiac night,
there lay a girthy man named Seuss.
He was feeling all couply and tight,
and needed some lovin' he wouldn't refuse.

He yearned for a lass to tease,
a partner to pleasure with ease.
He figured his luck had to please,
when a lady arrived without crease.

Her eyes they sparkled with spice,
she blushed his way and melted his ice.
He thought up aphrodisiacs nice,
and stumbled upon a most delicious device.

Thoughts flew through his head like quips,
on how to tantalize her with lips.
He used his tongue in many sips,
and savored the taste of her precious nips.

He took her body and made it nigh,
Exploring it thoroughly with a soft sigh.
She moaned and sang a sweet lullaby,
as he praised each curve, relieved it of its shy.

He licked and teased her silky skin,
while she moaned and sang from within.
Her tremors grew more and more thin,
as her pleasure welled to a crescendo din.

With rasps of delight and a wink of the eye,
he swung around to surprise her guy. 
She writhed and cooed to explore his thigh,
as his hands massaged her hips so high.

Then finally, finally climaxed they,
and mutually despaired from the sudden decay.
He smiled with contentment and thanked the beautiful day,
for the pleasure they both had shared with exquisite play.
