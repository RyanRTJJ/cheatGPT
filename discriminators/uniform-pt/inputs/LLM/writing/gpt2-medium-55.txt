 A reason to keep running your show.  So, if you have any interest in telling the story of why the show you are producing in 3 months could not get off the ground, email [email protected].  If you would rather not submit a story but would like to hear what you have to say instead, email [email protected].  You might like something different from them.  If you don't think you can do the short story, ask the series creator for another write-up.  They might not write it; you might. So let's give it a shot.  Be careful though.  You might end up finding that the story in "What if?" has more in common with your "What if it turned out to be a good thing?" story than you first imagined.  Don't give up.  I bet there are people out there doing well on their first story, writing great short stories the rest of their lives.  Don't give up.  This is a chance to test whatever you've learned to write.  If you think you got an idea, let other people know.  It doesn't have to be the same idea or even about the same story.  Just keep going until something sticks.
So, if you have any interest in telling the story of why the show you are producing in 3 months could not get off the ground, you can leave an email below.  At the very least, tell me why you want to tell this story, and why I should want to tell this story.
