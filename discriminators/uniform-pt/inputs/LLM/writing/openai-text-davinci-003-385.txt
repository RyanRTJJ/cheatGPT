It was raining the night I heard the stranger's voice from outside of our bedroom window. It had been dreary all day, and I had fallen asleep a few hours earlier, but something kept waking me up; it must have been the voice. I sat up in the dark, straining to hear what the stranger was saying. 

"Where did you go?" I heard him ask. "What happened to me? Were you here the whole time?"

My heart raced and I started to call for my husband, who lay motionless next to me in the bed. I can't explain why I didn't call out to the stranger outside our window. I was just too afraid, too shocked by the sound of his voice.

But then I heard rustling from across the room and saw our cat, Kit, leap from the curtains, where he had apparently been watching the stranger all along. He seemed to be staring right in the stranger's direction and hissing at him fiercely. 

But there was no answer from the stranger. I felt a wave of relief wash over me and I silently thanked our brave little cat for keeping us safe.

I crawled back into bed and my husband awoke and asked me what had happened. I recounted the mysterious voice, but he blamed it on the rain and told me I was just dreaming. 

But the truth is, I truly believe the stranger was here the whole time. Maybe Kit saw something that I didn't and was trying to protect us. Maybe he was trying to tell me something. All I know is that I'm thankful our little cat was there that night - and I'm glad I can still hear his voice in my head, even now.
