I had always heard the saying “life will never be the same”, but I didn’t truly understand it until that fateful day. That day changed my life forever.

It started off as any other day. I had my coffee and toast, got dressed, and prepared for work. Everything was humming along as it always did, until tragedy struck. A truck ploughed into the side of my car and I found myself lying in the road, a broken and mangled mess.

When I awoke, I was in a hospital bed with my body broken and battered. I felt a deep emptiness inside and I knew that things would never be the same. Recovery was a long and grueling process. I had to learn how to walk again, relearn all of my skills, and relearn how to enjoy the little things in life.

It took some time, but Eventually, I was able to find some sort of normalcy and solace in my new reality. People at work and home encouraged me as I slowly got back to who I was before the accident.

I no longer take life for granted and am grateful for each day. There’s an appreciation I have for the small things that I never had before. I became thankful and understanding of life and the experiences it brings.

Therefore, afterwards, I lived. Despite the tragedy that occurred, I was able to have a new lease on life. I found a strong will to live and thrive and it allows me to move forward and make the most of every moment.
