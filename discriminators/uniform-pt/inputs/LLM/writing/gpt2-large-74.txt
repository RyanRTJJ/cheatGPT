 (If this is what you want then you'll probably have the characters arrive back in a hurry! ) If you've got the characters arrive from a very long time in the past then it might be best to have someone from your time in high school arrive instead. A character should only have arrived once in this situation.
It should be an action-adventure book set in this setting. 
It should involve the characters learning about a supernatural force (which will be the main plot), the consequences of that action, and then what is going on now with them after they got away.
The characters should be from a generation that lived through the supernatural terror that was World War I, the horrors of the Second World War, and the Cold War, and are now adults, either members of the new nuclear generation or the old super-generation that left off around 1990. 
It should be either science fiction or horror in some way. 
It should give every character the ability to fight and think about what they're thinking, to make good decisions and act in situations which they didn't usually like to have to live through.
It should have an end set at some point in the future.
It should fit the premise of the plot set in the early 19th century.
The characters should be from a generation that was exposed to and influenced by the supernatural terror of World War I (or the two World Wars prior to that). 
They should know an awful lot about the war. 
They're not superheroes and they have no special powers. 
They must not be able to use magic for good, either. 
They need the guidance of an experienced military man and/or a woman with mystical connections to the supernatural.
They can't be "evil!" to avoid the consequences. 
They should be able to fight all the things they will encounter at some point in their lives. 
Let them die if they want and let the audience die when you're done with them.
This book should come out when they're 12/13, not 19/20
