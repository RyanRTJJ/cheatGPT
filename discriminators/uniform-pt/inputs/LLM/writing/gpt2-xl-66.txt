------------------------ The story begins with the caretaker, a wolf, giving you a farewell hug. They will not be here for long. He's the last remaining member of the breed after all. A new generation of the breed, the R-Series, will soon rise from the ashes. You are a fledgling R-Series and you will be raised in a small apartment in New York City. You are taught the customs and ways of the R-Series: how to protect your pack members and how to interact with humans. Your first challenge will come at the age of 13 when you take the first step out of your new life; you will witness a young woman killed by a wild animal. You will become the protector of your canine family when you become a leader of your pack at age 20 and you will raise your own pack. ------------------------ If you are having a hard time wrapping your head around the concepts presented in this writing prompt, that is ok and I can help.
