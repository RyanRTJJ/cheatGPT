This is not another rehash of a story I found written some time ago, but rather a new story I am working on. If you could enjoy, and have enjoyed, the stories in the other thread I would appreciate it if you could add your suggestions to this thread. This story was an idea I had several years ago and now I have a way to write it. Please comment your thoughts, your criticisms, anything at all that you might think is important to the story. I still like writing my own stories but if anyone ever writes a story that I would enjoy (hopefully they do) I will go over it with my editor and hopefully make some improvements.

"But, why would the Empire help us?" Han asked curiously. He looked at Kallen carefully, now that he was not so obviously staring at her breasts.

"I'll explain with this" Kallen showed him with her hand a gold necklace, which contained a small, round blue crystal. She placed it next to Han as she put on her jacket. "If we get FTL, the Empire will have to defend us forever" she concluded as she walked off toward something behind the wall.

Han stared at the necklace in question. What would you do if you had something like this? An artificial version of the Force? How many soldiers could you command? How about an entire fleet? How many ships could you send through the wormhole, like the Khetanna? Wouldn't such a thing mean the entire Empire's survival? Could you imagine the amount of ships fighting with the enemy? Or could you imagine the amount of power you could give to those ships if you had such an object?
