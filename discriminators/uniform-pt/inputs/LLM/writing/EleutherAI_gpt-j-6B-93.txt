The story could be in first person, second person or third person, and a POV character could be any of those.
For simplicity, I'll assume the entire world has been repopulated, so the story could be set in the past, present, or in a near-future which has been repopulated by clones.
The story will probably feature an antagonist who could be considered the protagonist, but don't feel restricted as your story may go in any direction.

The novel The Fall of the House of Usher, by M.R. James.
The protagonist is a young man, perhaps a man in his twenties, who, after a sudden seizure, wakes up in what appears to be the aftermath of a nuclear weapons test, a vast area completely buried by snow.
It's said that everyone has a house, a family; this young man has no identity, no history at all beyond that of his seizures. 
The plot has two main strands: the plot to uncover a reason for his present predicament, to recover his history (which includes his history, at least) and the plot to unravel the secret of his house, to go through its rooms and find out what is there.
One character we're introduced to early on is a former member of the KKK, who appears in a hallucination during an epileptic attack, and we are told that he's always dreamed in this nightmare setting. This suggests that the setting is a projection of the protagonist's unconscious mind.
I don't know whether it's your thing, but the book deals with several areas - the occult, madness, the role of the unconscious mind, the idea of a family and, most importantly, the idea of a place. In that regard, it's a very "paranoid" novel, but not in such a way that the genre is derided. It's just the way a weird kind of story likes to be told.
