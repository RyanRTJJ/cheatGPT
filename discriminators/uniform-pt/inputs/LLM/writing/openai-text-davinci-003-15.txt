It was Christmas time, and Kayla was extra excited this year. Decorations were everywhere and the lights, carols and warmth put a wide smile on her face.

Her family gathered around, exchanging gifts and shredding food and laughter. It was a special occasion for sure, as all of her brothers and sisters from around the world were reunited in one place.

But this year was different. Her older brother, John, had just returned from the war with a few medals. Everyone was surprised, but Kayla was literally jumping around with joy. This meant that he was finally back with them – and just in time for the holidays.

The gifts were opened, and everyone had their turn to show off. But when it came to John, there were more hugs and looks of love than anything else. He felt like a hero, and Kayla felt lucky just to be in the same room as him.

The night ended the same way it always did – family singing carols and laughing around the piano, with Kayla in the middle of all the joy. That night, and every holiday from here on out, was going to be a little brighter thanks to John's presence.
