Steve leaned forward in his chair, plastered his palms against the table, and stared deep into his wife's watery blue eyes. His lips trembled as he spoke, a thousand secrets spilling out with his words that he had kept hidden for the last 10 years of their marriage.

"You don't want me to answer that, and you know it," he said in a low voice, his gaze never straying from hers.

A tear ran down Jane's face as she nodded slowly. She had known all these years that something had been wrong, but she had been too afraid to ask. Too afraid of the answer.

But now, here was Steve, offering her the truth. Unfiltered and raw. It was almost too much for her to bear.

Jane opened her mouth to speak, but before she could, Steve stood up and walked away from the table. Without another word, he left the room, leaving Jane alone with her thoughts.

She stayed in the same spot for what seemed like hours as she replayed the words he had said to her. He was right. She didn't want him to answer that question. She already knew the answer and she wasn't ready to face it.

No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't escape the truth â€“ Steve and her marriage were no more.
