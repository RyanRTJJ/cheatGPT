About Andrew Bowers This story was created in collaboration with the people at the story-telling site Storyspost.net. The entire first draft was written within 24 hours after the world was hit by terrorism by the world's leading terrorist organization, al-Qaeda (not coincidentally, the name of the book in the story). It was the first thing I did upon waking up after being out for a month of inactivity due to health issues. The writing was done in a sitting position, though I sat every day for the month in case I got up at all. Most of the writing took place while I was in bed, on my laptop at night, on the train going to work in the morning and in the early hours of the morning on bus trips between work and my house. I wrote the entire story on Sunday, then worked on it for 12 days before I returned my laptop to Storyspost to be read out loud on my radio show with the rest of my writing-group on Monday, and finished work on Saturday before returning to bed. The story has its own twitter account @TheJoltEffect, a facebook page, and a website: http://www.thejolteffect.com.
The Jolt Effect  is a creative writing group that was started by a group of individuals who, on their respective personal websites or on social media platforms (e.g. FB), started sharing their stories. They came together at the idea that a group of creative thinkers could use their medium of choice as a voice to address what's going on in the world. They write about things in the real world they have directly experienced. By talking about the real world, they give hope to the reader. This is why they have no one name and no organizational structure. They aren't about one individual, but about the group's goals of bringing awareness to the real world through stories.
