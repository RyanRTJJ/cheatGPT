Jack always knew he was different. He felt it in his bones, but failing to understand why, he just had to keep going with his life. He was always the odd one out in his friend group, but he liked it that way. He enjoyed being alone.

Today was different, however. He awoke with a jolt, and almost immediately, he knew what his true purpose in life was. He had to protect his city from a great evil, something no one could have anticipated.

Jack quickly made plans, gathering weapons and supplies, preparing for war. He had to protect his city - even if it meant sacrificing himself in the process.

It was a daunting task, and Jack wasn't sure he had the strength to carry out his newfound duty. He wanted to run and hide, to forget about what he now knew about the darkness that was about to come, but he knew he couldn't do that. He was the only one who could stop the evil, the only one brave enough to face them directly.

So, Jack accepted his fate and prepared for battle. He may not have wanted the duty of protecting his city, but it was his, and deep down, he accepted it. He was the only one who could save his city, and he would do whatever it took.
