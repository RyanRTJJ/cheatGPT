 When you turn the handle it's an entirely new space, something completely different, and you can't understand why.  You spend a night there and when you get out you ask questions of the person who rented it, who answers all questions you ask in bewilderment and horror, but not in the usual manner of people who don't live there.
I will definitely try this, thank you!
This is exactly what I did.  It's so weird and unsettling, you must remember to not make it about yourself and think of it as a story to share.
Yeah, I think it's going to take a lot of thinking out. I just thought about it and I'm having some hard time thinking of a premise for it. Maybe something with a child, a baby, but it makes me worried.
If you're having that trouble try thinking in 3rd person. Think of the character as you would if they were writing their script, you know.  As in it's their narrative, not yours, and they're having a hard time imagining how to tell it in a first person story.
I will definitely remember that, thank you.
You're welcome.  Best of luck to you and I hope you win!  P.S. I am super curious about what this prompt will turn out to be, now!
Thanks again. I'll let you know when I have it!
I just read the one word story and I'm intrigued. You should probably edit it to not give away too many more hints.
Sure, sorry, it's there:  "The door"
I'd love to read it, if you don't mind?
I'd prefer to keep it anonymous, thank you so much anyway!
