 Here is McCain's response (or rather, his response to questions from the media) regarding such a situation and how he believes McCain is a hero.  He writes: I have known Senator John McCain for years.  In the years to come, I believe that he will be a great hero in this effort, but his actions belie his character.  This is obviously a hard question for me to answer.  But after reading a few of McCain's responses to various questions related to his service to the country, I know it's my hope that McCain isn't quite as heroic.  I've seen in this campaign that while some have wondered what kind of people McCain really is (and who truly understands his "informal" demeanor), the first thing I have to tell you is that his character is very real, and his character is based on real experience.  He certainly appears to have been on the receiving end of an attack that would seem at first glance to be an attempt to intimidate and harass him, and to attack the credibility of McCain, rather than trying to "get this person down"? McCain is not an opportunistic bully.  He believes this to be the key to building his presidential campaign.  He's certainly not a weak, weak-willed politician. It's certainly up to him to work a lot less hard about who he is. He will never use force to defend himself against his enemies, but he is certainly not afraid to use force whenever necessary, and I think he gets it.
