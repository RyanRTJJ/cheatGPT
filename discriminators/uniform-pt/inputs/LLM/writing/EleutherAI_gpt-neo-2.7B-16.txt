  The last thing you will see ________? A last look ___________________________________________________? You are going to watch the destruction of Earth below you... as the moon sinks into the Earth... you just don't know quite how.  If you are a real spaceman, you are more than a little surprised to realize how close the other inhabitants on Earth were to getting wiped out.  Earth is currently burning in the moon's absence. How could that happen?

**1**. The asteroid is big enough to destroy all life on Earth. The asteroid is a very big planet, though. If it hit the Earth, the atmosphere would be destroyed, killing all life. The biggest asteroid that has ever been found is about 1,000 times bigger than the asteroid that is about to hit Earth. It is 1,000 times bigger than the biggest land mass that has been discovered (at the same time). It would have a similar effect on the Earth as it would on a football field.

**2**. The asteroid isn't big, but it is enough to destroy all life on the Earth.  The asteroid is about 5 miles across. It is the size of a golf ball or a baseball, which is more than 1,000 times bigger than everything on the planet. It is also very hot.

**3**. What is the best thing to do?  As the asteroid is nearing Earth at thousands of miles per hour, you decide the best thing to do is to get a message to other spacemen. Then you run from the area to warn them in case there is a problem. Unfortunately, the asteroid is going to hit Earth within the next two minutes. The news is almost impossible. The best thing you can do is to get a message to other spacemen in case there is danger. Then you run.  It's almost impossible to tell which planet will receive this message, even if only a few spacemen get in touch with them. But that is
