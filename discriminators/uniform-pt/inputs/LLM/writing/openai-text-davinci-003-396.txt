I woke up with a splitting headache, as bright sunlight blasted through a gap in the curtains. I groaned and inhaled sharply, my nose full of the smell of whisky, beer, and cigar smoke. Still dazed, I sat up, looking around the unfamiliar room in confusion for a few moments before it all came back to me.

It had been a wild night of partying with friends, with lots of drinking, dancing, and all the usual debauchery. But now, with a pounding headache and the hangover slowly setting in, I just wanted to be alone.

Then, I spotted a briefcase on the nightstand, and a sticky note on the front that read: "For your troubles." I opened the case and inside, I found stacks of crisp hundred-dollar bills.

It took a moment for the implications of what I'd found to sink in. I had no idea where this money came from, or why it was here, but I knew one thing: I was not going to give this up. I pocketed the cash, grabbed the briefcase, and quickly made my escape.

That day, I bought a brand new car, paid my rent, and wrote a thank-you note to whoever had left me the cash. I never heard back but I will always be grateful for that mysterious act of kindness, and the reminder of how quickly fortunes can change.
