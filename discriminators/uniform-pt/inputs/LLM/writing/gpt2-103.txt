 Now in the age of Google and Bing search, you're still doing nothing you could do to stop people from changing you to become a little better.  Instead, you're doing an even worse job.  Don't just say no to new questions, don't use your power. Don't just say no when the old one starts dropping in one of your answers.  Don't go looking for your answers when the new one starts popping up and getting stuck trying to figure it out. And even if you're not trying, try to use your power and see if you can somehow make it work.  That's what the web does—it helps others to do the things that we might not be able to do today.  And so, we hope you'll do yourself, and those of you like us, proud to serve everyone we serve. Please tell your friends about this. And please don't just let their feedback and requests stop you.

That's just because I've been so stupid for a short amount of time." In other words, my friend has an interesting question. She's been thinking of us, so she's talking about us with an open
