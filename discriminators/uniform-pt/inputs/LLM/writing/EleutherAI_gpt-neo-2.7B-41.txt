Your partner and coauthor (or you) will develop the main character's personality, relationships, and overall theme. Remember, this is primarily a writing exercise! Your goal is to provide a believable and exciting story. Try to include some of your own feelings, reactions, thoughts, and opinions, because writing that comes from the heart is more fun and less likely to change the course of your writing. And if you want to make the story your own, you're not just following another storyteller; You're writing your own story, whether you choose to call it fiction or not.

Be completely open about your characters. What do they look like? Who is their best friend? What do they believe in? Does one belong to you or someone else? Is their mind different from yours? Be completely honest, both about yourself and about your characters. The writing process is about expressing your heart as a writer and then taking a step back and letting your characters speak for themselves. (I recommend using a pen name for your main character, but you could use an identity of your own in your story if that's a desire.)

Keep this basic template before you start on the story:

 **_It's been a week since Jack died. He was a wonderful guy. He was my best friend._**

**_I don't have to work, I can stay with him and be comforted by him._**

**_Jack had lots of friends, always ready to help him do anything._**

**_Jack was a caring, loving guy._**

**_I miss him so much._**

**_I want him to come back to life! Please let him come back soon._**

A note about the writing process. If you are a beginner, you will probably follow the basic structure found in this book and on these pages. However, you may find that your stories take on new, more personal directions if you feel led by them in ways that go beyond the written words. Sometimes it is best to go with your gut feelings, as writing will serve as a kind of therapy for you.
