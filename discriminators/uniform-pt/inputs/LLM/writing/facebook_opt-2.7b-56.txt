 You might get away with a bit of a twist.  edit: Also, your story needs more description. I'm honestly having a tough time getting a feel for anything in it.
Oooo I got you!  Also, I will try to better description.
A good place to start is "this dark house with a hole in the roof" and work your way from there.
That sounds cool! The description is really hard for me. I had a hard time coming up with something. Like I am literally doing my best right now but I just can't describe it in any kind of good way. Do I have to write words here? No, I think images would be better, that's where most descriptions I have had difficulty.
Hmm. Maybe you could give me a small idea of your writing style? Or give me a hint at something in your story that you want to show me in the description? I do tend to have a hard time picturing people on the page because they could be in a scene, talking, or simply reading something. All the more reason it would help if you gave me something else to go on.
It's a horror sort of story. It could be done without a lot of description. It's really just me talking to myself. I don't want it to sound cliche, so I don't want to do like a lot of describing but I don't want it to come off as dull. I'll put it up soon. Thanks :)
Alright, look for the update in about a week.
Okie doki. Thanks :P
Hey, the story is done. :) Please post it with some kind of new flair.
It's up on fanfiction.net and on my profile :)
It's not showing up for me. It doesn't say "approved".
Hmm. I think I did something wrong. Maybe I did it while asleep. What's your email address?
