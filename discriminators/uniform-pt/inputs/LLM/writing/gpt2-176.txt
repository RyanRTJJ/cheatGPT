Â that is until you finally see one. You do this because you really feel in control of the city. You know it well. I like the way it starts for me. Even though it is about 2 hours before it closes down you can still get a feel for it when you open it. I'm also glad that I read a lot and didn't feel this rush of nostalgia before getting into it. This could be the best story I have ever read. If you've never read it before it is a real thrill to play it. Its kind of like playing in a park as you see it for the first time. When you open it, you only see the world slowly become clearer just as the world you've seen is made clear. This book isn't for you until it is clear to you that they really have been through this before. You may love it or hate it depending on the situation. It is a real love story, I hope it helps you to feel in control of the city.
In summary. This is a great book to read in any setting, no matter how small. Even though my wife had to sleep the whole time over my head, my daughter is an okay person and is having a better time at work. It is also a great book in a war zone, so stay prepared or you can be killed by the people you are fighting. I love the style in this book for it is a good blend of the fantasy and science fiction elements for a war war.
