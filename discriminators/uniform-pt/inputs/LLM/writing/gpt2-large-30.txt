 This book is about your journey. Tell a story based on this prompt: A beautiful woman walks into your living room. She's not your average customer, she's a fellow pickpocket and you have no idea what's going on.  And, as you look her over, you realize her face is as frightening as you'd imagined it would be.  Will this get you through the night or will you be haunted by this woman's ghost?  A sequel of sorts to the "Ghost Story" prompt.   Tell a story based on this prompt and check the words you wrote out: You wake up in your bed. And you're no longer able to move your arm or legs.  Only a lump of dried blood lies where you once were. All the time your hand, and all your other senses are gone. And you cannot forget, however hard you try, how that lump feels like it's trying to bite your flesh. And there are two choices.  One is to stand up and run, leaving it to the angels of death and hell to take the flesh from your arms and legs and leave you to bleed out on the floor.  The other option is to go back to sleep and keep trying to kill yourself while imagining everything that happens when you wake up.

Good idea. That's cool. Reply Delete
Good idea, but I doubt that will work unless you have some sort of supernatural ability. I wonder whether it would work if you got a bit closer to the action and were a bit scared while reading it. But at the same time i guess they are probably just trying to get some insight into what the character is like as a person. As for the books, they seem pretty funny. Reply Delete
Good points. I'll read them. I'm just wondering if people would consider a third book of theirs. Good question, but that seems unlikely to me.
