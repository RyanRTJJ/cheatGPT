 Also, is your username in reference to a particular anime?
No, I've been calling myself Pappy for like 10 years and I kept it after I got pregnant and started a new life. It ended up for my kids being their name, I'd be happy to tell you what it is but I don't wanna give it away. Haha
Alright alright.
Haha it's a play on my first name. I don't have kids and it's just like, "Yeah, mommy, I'm over here" and they're like "Over where?" And then I say "Over my belly." They're all "Yeah, that's good, mommy... you can say that." And I'm all, "Yeah, my name's Pappy, it's all part of the whole name thing... it's all about love."    I'm just trying to get my point across I guess. Haha.
So basically your username is the name of a popular anime... Gotcha
Nah, Pappy is a nickname that my mother gave my children. Lol
So your username is the name of a popular anime character? So what's the story with naming your children Pappy?
My mom and stepdad really loved the anime Grand Blue. It's a show about a boy and a water polo player
I've seen that show. I think I remember that anime. I'll see if I can find it again. Thanks for the explanation!
It's one of the best anime I've seen, it's like a cross between the Simpsons and Clannad but more funny and less sad and sadder. If you're into humor and are into water polo anime you'll love it. Haha
I'll try to find it! I watched Clannad once. I haven't been watching anime lately, I've been trying to learn how to play league of legends, but it hasn't been happening.
