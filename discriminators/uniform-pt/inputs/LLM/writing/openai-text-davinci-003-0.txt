As I scrolled through the corridors of my high school, I had a feeling of vigilance that I didn't usually feel. It was as if I had to be prepared for something unusual. Then I saw him, the new kid sitting alone at a desk, tapping away on a laptop. I stopped in my tracks and immediately felt my skin crawl.

I knew from experience that it wasn't a good sign. I had the ability to measure how dangerous people were, giving them a ranking from 1 to 10, with 1 being a normal child and 10 being the most dangerous I could imagine. When I saw the new kid, the number 10 floated through my head almost immediately, and I knew I had to be extra careful.

He didn't look like he was dangerous, with his unassuming demeanor and quirky sense of style, but I knew different. I felt an air of power and menace that I knew wasn't going to be taken lightly. I had to be careful around him and avoid him at all costs, because who knew what kind of powers he possessed or what he was capable of.

All throughout the day, I felt like my stomach was in knots, knowing the potential danger that this new student presented. I didn't understand why he had a ranking of 10, and I wanted to find out more about him, but I knew it was best to stay away. After all, who knew what would happen if I got too close.
