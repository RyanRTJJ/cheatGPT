 for those of you who like to pretend that life is better than it feels
A story by someone I care about that's made me happier than I have in years, or even months
A happy message about finding and making friends that will last awhile and maybe even create a relationship  that lasts long enough that I decide to tell someone else  about 
My husband has the happiest relationship I've enjoyed in years, and this story is just a tiny piece of that wonderful story (not mine)
  For those of you hoping that I'll get more into the story of her life, hope for the best because I can't possibly understand it without going into further detail than it already is.   
And for anyone else hoping for more of this, please know that it wasn't my intention to get in too much into it. In fact, the reason I chose that topic was because I didn't want it to get too much into my actual life. I believe the story is about a little girl's life, which, to the best of my knowledge, I'm not too familiar with. So please, please don't worry if it turns out that my husband didn't have any friends while I was growing up which is one thing that makes this whole thing so frustrating (I hope that I don't ever have such an experience, but I was being pretty vague on why I'm going ahead and not giving anything away). 
So please know, after all of this, don't send me any emails about me being sad about how I feel because that will not do anything to relieve the stress, only make me cry more. In fact, if you want something personal and emotional to come out, there is actually a link to that story here on reddit!
Thank you for reading!! Please continue visiting here if you can. I really hope that I can make it through this whole mess that I hope to get through with the kindness of my heart. Thanks again for reading!
