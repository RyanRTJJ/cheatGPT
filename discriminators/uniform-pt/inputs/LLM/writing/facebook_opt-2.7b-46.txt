   When I got this, I thought, "That's just a way to get us people who talk while driving. The last thing the cops want to deal with is a guy with a cell phone driving at 100 MPH." ... Then I realized it was about writing.
Ha I was going to do this, since the last time I wrote a non-plot-critical story I ended up getting pulled over.  That said, I am not writing a story right now. I actually just took this to get me to write.
I was writing it but it got weird as I got drunk and then the internet shut down. And then when I tried to get on a chat server I realised, "Wait, all this stuff would make for a great story."   ... Then I wrote it.
Lol oh wait I forgot this was AskReddit, so fuck me right.  Can I be arrested for drunk-posting?   I just want to get drunk and make some good stories.
It depends on what the drunk posting is for. For example, if you're just posting a poem you wrote on Reddit then I will let you post as many times as you like. If you were drunk on /r/gonewild, that's illegal. ... But I am going to start using a bot this year (on this account) and do it for you.
I don't know why, but my head is just *really* blown away at this.   If you get a bot please PM me and I'll set it up for you. I'm kind of a drunk.
I will, but keep in mind that it's going to be a while. I'd like to get to sleep first. But we can work this out tomorrow.
