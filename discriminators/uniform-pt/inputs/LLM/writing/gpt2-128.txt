 It's a sign that you have a problem with the person or family you care for anymore – even though your body has the most powerful tattoos available and still needs to be updated.
So in a big way, "Candy Crush" and "Twilight" were the "first" games we made when designing the franchise. We all know how often game companies make fun of the characters – but I mean, what if your first game didn't include many of that goofy fun? What if it wasn't so obvious you just had to put it all back right away and still work on it? Maybe it was just a bad design that didn't have much relevance to the audience? If you're like me, you have to feel bad to do something that makes it look easy.
I can see many design decisions where we ended up over-thinking things from a long time ago. If game developers tried to make the player like a baby, and they didn't, they'd end up with a "what would make baby sound like?" type of game. You're never gonna get as much out of a game as a good game.
It's possible we'll end up getting more of the same, but that's for another day, guys …
The second game's a little different. This game will involve fighting and survival against the undead (or "Evil Ones") but not in a physical arena. There's no combat at all at the start. When you've made the decision to bring two people into this game, you've created a very, very hard and unforgiving world. When you start with one player and go into what you call "The Zombie Apocalypse" and start to beat them or make their home, it makes sense to have at least one other zombie with the same powers as you. That's what the games feel like to you. As is the case with most games.
