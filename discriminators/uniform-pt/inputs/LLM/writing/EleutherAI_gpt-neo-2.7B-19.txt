There was never a better time to be a man than when music was still popular. With the ability to control the minds of all men, the music of the gods was still being used by the nations for the most nefarious of purposes. Though they all had their uses for music and what they could do with it was one of the main reasons for the decline of the past, if you ask Mirta, the goddess of fate, it's easy to tell you she'd like music to just be forgotten.

In a world of gods, men had to figure something out.

"I know not what to make of what we hear, but that's no matter, there is time for that later, for now is when we must decide who is worthy to join the gods. So many are so foolish, for who is it that is stronger than a goddess? And who is it that can beat them at their own game?" asked Mirta. _________________________________________________________

It was a cold late winter's day, and Mirta walked in the freezing cold streets of Narsindal, the capital of Narts.

"Who knows what he will choose to do? This is not only the future of Narsindal but of the entire world! We live in a beautiful world, and it is because of the music and the gods that we live in such good times. It is this, the love of music, that we must not lose, and if we lose, we will lose forever." The goddess Mirta sang out passionately to the streets of the city.

In his mind, Mirta began to hear the melodies of the heavens in his head. __________________________________________________________

The streets of the city of Narsindal began to buzz as the city's people began to cheer the coming of the goddess; a great celebration. The city was filled with music, dancing and music in his mind. It was a night, and all the time seemed right; Narsindal was filled with joy, and all thoughts of the gods were forgotten. ___________________________________________________________
