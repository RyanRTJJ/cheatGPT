_____________________________________ In the second floor library, there's a bookshelf with books. One of them has been turned into a giant book. There's a row of books, but there's so little space, the shelves keep closing. "I want to tell everyone how awesome the book was, but... how are you supposed to put that on the shelf...?" A question you cannot avoid, the way it always is. You turn to the young man next to you. Your mouth opens in surprise, but you have something else to say. "Thank you," you say. "Thank you," he says back. (There's, of course, no way that you'll actually get away with saying "thank you." It won't be polite.) "It'll be nice," you continue. "Aww... maybe we could buy these two books that, if we owned them, we wouldn't need to read in the first place?" He shakes his head. "They'll get destroyed..." Your heart is thumping so hard that it hurts. "It's better than nothing, though." The room is echoing with your voice. It feels more like a chorus of voices, chanting like a giant song when they finally agree. The two books you just bought all fall over the edge of the shelves. "They get destroyed!" You laugh nervously, hoping to sound as cheerful as you can. "Oh." He smiles. "I'm sure." "Heh." You move to where your bag is, but he stops you. He reaches out and grabs the two books from behind you. "Hey, let's not give them up." He hands them to you. You look at him. His dark eyes are the only things you can see when you look at him. "I still like it!" You sigh, shaking your head. (Don't worry, they can be replaced.) "I know," he says. He then holds them back up to the light so you can see the spine of the books. "This is beautiful," he says. "I think the illustrations really capture the words." "Oh,"
