~~by the Russians~~ that wreaks havoc on the global financial markets.  Edit: Russian hackers, of course.
No, it seems pretty clear it was Chinese hackers. You are just too stupid to comprehend the difference.
The headline was worded to provoke outrage, so I figured Russian hackers would be the best bet. But Chinese hackers can also play the same game.
The article is about Chinese...
Why does your comment sound like you didn't read it?
It's called context...
No, it's called snark and being condescending. You made no fucking sense.
Wow, you guys are getting worked up about the Chinese hackers. Pretty funny.
Because that Russian joke was soooo fucking funny.
It wasn't a joke dumbass. Also, it's not clear in the article where exactly the Chinese hackers claim to have come from. But as for who was behind it, I can't blame you, you probably aren't even reading the article.
I was aware that Russians are hackers for America. How many Americans live in Moscow? Zero. Russia is an American ally, and a lot of American citizens live there. China is the #1 enemy of Russia. That's clearly why the Russians hate them.
Why is everyone so butthurt about Russia today? This is seriously just as bad as the Ukraine thing.
Are you fucking serious?! It's not even the same thing.  This is about fucking hackers hacking a computer system that controls the financial system worldwide. You guys are being so melodramatic about it, and it's not even funny. Russian hackers are clearly behind this. Chinese hackers can play that exact same game. You are being childish, stop it.
This is about the hacking of the US government and Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Get something straight and stop acting like a child. I'm not being immature and I don't live in China.
And why did these hackers choose the US Government in the first place? It's not like they are in love with the President. You're being stupid.
