In what other way is the shapeshifter known? The human eye is limited to a very narrow range of colors and shapes of light, so maybe humans can use the shapeshifter's eyes to perceive them?

Think about how to use your magic to get people to talk about their experiences. What do you have to do?

What should you avoid or keep secret when you're on your mission? _________________________________

Read a book about a shapeshifter, such as "The Shapeshifter (Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants)", by American writer Ann Brashares. _______________________________

Find all the words in the shapeshifter definition above. In your word file, mark them with a * that means: a shapeshifter:

A shapeshifter: A creature who can imitate the physical shapes of things. The shapeshifter usually takes on the form of something else, preferably of something less than ordinary. (An animal. Maybe an insect. Sometimes water, soil, fire, air, wood, or metal.)

_______________________________

Use the other shapeshifter clues. In your word document, mark the words that have been marked with * above.

Write a description of your own shapeshifter. If you want to read some other people's shapeshifter descriptions, visit Shapeshifter-Write-A-Story.

_______________________________

Think about the meaning of the word and how you can make something shapeshifted. You choose something for the shapeshifter to do. Think of what you can change, and if possible, add a hint about what kind of magic your shapeshifter uses. Do not worry about the other types of shapeshifters. Do not worry whether you add any details to this puzzle. Think about how you might create an illusion of shapeshifting in your own world. ____________________________

How would you find clues to this? The shapeshifter's form. The shapeshifter's eyes. How the shapeshifter got this shapeshifting.________________________

What do you do when you're tracking someone? Track them. How do you know what to track? Find them again? Do you follow a clue that you find first?
