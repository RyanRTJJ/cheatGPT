 What's the secret to your powers?  Also, how can you deal with the people who find out that your secret is really just that you don't have them?

We will not reveal what your secret power is.  But we will make reference to that if you wish.  We won't reveal how you got it either. If you are worried, we will make it known where it came from, and if you have no choice in the matter, we will be completely transparent here.  Please be ready to explain your background, and even take on a secret identity if you like.  The more details you give us the better! If you have no choice in the matter and you're worried about keeping your secret, don't worry.  We won't reveal any of your secrets if you don't want to.  You don't have to tell anyone what you do! Just say that you love your friends, make sure they know in advance that you will be doing this at your work, and don't get upset if you don't get a response for a week or two. Also, if you're feeling particularly brave and can handle a secret (you like to have it both ways, really, right?), then by all means leave it out.  Everyone is doing it and you'll get just as many questions about it. The best advice I can give if you're at all nervous is to give a good description of your costume.  Show everyone how you feel about it, get a sense of the kind of jokes and reactions it is going to get.   Then just keep it to yourself and say you have a secret. That's all one needs to know.
