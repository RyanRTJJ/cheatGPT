 It was only the second time that she had seen the same response. She told me that, in her mind, I was never dead at all and I wish anyone would remember me and how they felt because I always saw you.  After you spoke to me she went off to a more personal school and a business class.  Her mother and I were at her side, looking after her husband while he was out with the teachers.
