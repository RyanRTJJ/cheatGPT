What was the word you used for this prompt?  What do you see it spelling out today?  Why?

This was a short story submission by a fellow TGM student, where you'd figure that it would be the usual, "he looks at her like she's made of lead...she is not!" But I could tell this was meant to be a little strange. It takes a special kind of character to do what this person does. Was this a submission you wanted to submit to TGM?  Does this give you any advice on how you would like your story picked?
My first submission to tgm for a contest. I always liked the short stories (and the fact that I'm not technically an English major, or a doctor at best), and I was drawn to the idea that the only people that could use them for evil purposes are those who already have a plan for the apocalypse. I love the idea of a person in control over the apocalypse. That's a little bit scary as a story to me, but that's why I love it.
