What would you do if you were the prime minister, who was supposed to be flying this plane? 
What would you do if you were the president of one of the countries involved?  
What would you do if you were the man who had taken control of the ship, but he now had a new plan? 

This is an example of what we'll be doing when we are not able to answer this question on Time for Travel. I am very grateful to every one of you for taking the time to answer this.

I'd be worried about the safety of my passengers on the flight, and whether they would all survive.
I'd worry about my own safety since at least 2 other countries have confirmed that MH370 landed at a location other than where MH370 last communicated with flight controllers.  So I'd assume the plane was turned somewhere, and turned it off in order to hide its location.
And, I'd worry about my own life in the event of a terrorist attack because I know how dangerous they can be.

There's an excellent chance a terrorist took control of the plane, diverted it, and hijacked it.  And there's a good chance that if they had control they'd have taken it all the way home.  Because once they take control, it doesn't matter how many people are on board: they can get the plane in mid-flight with a fire and a rocket strapped to it.  And because of this, there's little that we can do about it.
The only real way you can protect your life is by not doing the same thing that they are going to do: land the plane somewhere not known, or where flight controllers will not know what to do.  So if you know that the plane is going to land somewhere not listed in the flight status report, like a desert area, I'd worry about getting on the plane.  But it
