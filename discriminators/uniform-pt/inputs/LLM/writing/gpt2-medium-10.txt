Â - If you can build the ship and the characters, they get a sword, but the protagonist doesn't, what ship will you build?
In Conclusion
As always, it is very easy to make this prompt work on any computer and save it into a file. But don't do it for the sake of the prompt -- just because you can, doesn't mean you should. But if you use Windows or Mac OS X, keep in mind that the prompt could be written using any of these platforms or plugins. Just make sure any characters you pick are using character sheets, just like you would do your normal prompt or if you had a script handy, you could also include characters from the game's menus and a list of available ship crew.
Now that my prompt is in a good place, let's look at each of the five characters that have powers.

First up, we have the "Hero of Swords" power. It gives the protagonist the ability to create swords by using a stone that makes the weapon stronger than steel and having it come in metal types.
This isn't the best explanation, because the Golden Sword can actually be made with any weapon and can be made stronger than any metal. However, it does fit the bill because the Golden Sword really is stronger than any steel weapon that the protagonist can craft, like the Iron Dragon and the Dark Scythe.
Of course, there are some limitations to the Golden Sword. Most of them are related to making the Golden Sword, which is why even with the "Hero of Swords" power, it can only be made in metal types. Also, if you don't want to add any special abilities to your characters, just leave out all of the normal powers.
Silver Sword
The Silver Sword power isn't as flexible as the above power because
