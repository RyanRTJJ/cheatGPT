John was a casual smoker and enjoyed the occasional cigarette as he had a cup of coffee or other beverage of choice. As such, he had set up a chair and footrest in his small, but cosy backyard for a spot of quiet relaxation.

He never really gave the "footrest" much thought, but would occasionally find himself wondering where it had come from. It certainly looked rather old, but aside from this he didn't give it much thought and continued to enjoy hours of smoking on his comfortable piece of furniture.

At first, he didn't believe the old man's story. It seemed too outlandish; how could a mysterious relic from the past inexplicably materialise in his backyard? But, as the old man continued to talk, John began to understand more about the object in his back-yard--it was a lost relic, hundreds of years old which had been in his family for generations.

Though the man could not reveal its full history, he knew that it had special powers and was to be kept safe. It seemed like this relic had followed John's family through time, and now it had found its way to its rightful home.

John was awestruck and ever since, he had given the footrest much more attention and respect. He even smiled as he thought of the journey it had taken to his backyard and the stories it could tell. Though it was just a simple footrest, it now held more meaning for him than ever before.
