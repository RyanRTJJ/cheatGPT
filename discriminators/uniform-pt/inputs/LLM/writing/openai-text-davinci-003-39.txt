The air was filled with an eerie stillness on the morning that the world ended. I had been warned it was coming, but I never expected it to be like this.

I had awoken on the last morning of our world with the sun just beginning to peek over the horizon. I stepped outside and looked around; everything seemed so empty, so quiet. I noticed in the distance, a faint rumble of something that sounded like thunder but with a strange high-pitched whine.

As the sound grew closer, I realized that it wasn't thunder at all. It was the sound of a plane, slowly flying overhead. Watching it, I felt a strange sense of hope; was this the end of the world...or something new?

The plane quickly passed by and disappeared into the horizon, leaving me with my thoughts. Then the sky suddenly lit up with a brilliant white light. I flinched and covered my eyes, the light so intense that it hurt.

The rooftop I stood on creaked and groaned, and then it shifted. I felt the building begin to tremble and I stumbled back, feeling the wave of heat wash over me. The sound of screaming and chaos filled the air, and I knew that this was it, the end of our world.

The wave of heat subsided and I looked around, disbelief gripping me. What remained of the city I had once known was gone, replaced with a wasteland of sonic rubble. Looking up, I saw the sun still beaming brightly; its light never wavered.

Though the world as I knew it had ended, memories of it remained. The memories of friends and family, of days filled with laughter, of a world with promise for a brighter future
