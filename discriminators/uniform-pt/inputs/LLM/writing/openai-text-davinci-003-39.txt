The day started normally enough. I'd woken up, gotten ready for school, and had just stepped out the door with my backpack in hand when I stumbled, trips briefly on the edge of the stairs and tumbles forward. Landing on my hands and knees, I’m relieved to find that I hadn’t broken anything but there’s a strange tightness in my right arm and I take a look to find that a jagged piece of metal is sticking out of my arm.

I rush back inside to find my mom, who helps me pry the piece of metal out of my arm - as it turns out, I had managed to cut myself quite deep. But when we’re done, I gasp in surprise. Instead of blood and muscle tissue, my arm is filled with intricate wires and metal components, glowing softly blue in the faint light. 

I'm immediately flanked by my mom and my dad, who take me to the hospital. The doctors examine me, shocked to see that I have some sort of artificial body part. I'm sent for further testing, but eventually I'm diagnosed with a new form of cyborg-robotic technology, which has been implanted in me since birth. And finally, I understand why I’d been having all those weird aches and pains - it was my body trying to adjust to the changes it had been through. 

At first, I’m a bit apprehensive about this new discovery, but I eventually accept it. My parents explain to me how unique and special I am, and how I'm the first person to ever have this particular Type of technology in their body - and, to be honest, I finally feel happy and complete.
