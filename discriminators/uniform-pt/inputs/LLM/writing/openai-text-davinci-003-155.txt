The Galactrians, an ancient and peaceful civilisation, had lived in harmony for centuries. But when another race from their galaxy, the Xonthians, began to conquer and oppress other planets, the Galactrians realised they needed to act fast.

The Galactrians were no match for the Xonthians, and their home world was at great risk of invasion. Out of desperation, the Galactrians reached out to the one species they knew that was more brutal and powerful than their enemy - the humans from Earth.

The Galactrians and the humans made a pact: in exchange for FTL technology, the Galactrians would provide the humans with access to their treasury of alien knowledge. After much negotiation, the humans agreed.

The FTL technology provided by the Galactrians gave the humans an edge over the Xonthians and allowed them to fight back with newfound strength. The Xonthians were soon driven out of the galaxy, leaving the Galactrians free to start rebuilding their home world.

Thanks to the humans, the Galactrians were once again free to continue living in peace.
