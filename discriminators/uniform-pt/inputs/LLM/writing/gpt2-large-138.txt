I would add that while "The Starry Sky" may be one of the simpler science fiction stories out there, it's a bit of a cheat. There were certainly challenges involved.


One of the challenges was that each image in the book was designed to be at a particular location on the sky. This means that any new image being sent to you by the paper would have to be copied and relocated so that it would fit on the page. Then, as you read the story, the page and page layout were copied from the original book, so the original image would be changed from it's old location on the page. I also was lucky enough to find an image of a particular star in my search, but to the best of my knowledge no original image of that star has been captured by someone else to create this new book.


I did find a few examples of other pictures that were taken from the book. What I was most interested in is actually seeing this whole sequence put into motion.


We've started the story with the paper image, but for the first few pages, the page is only a black screen. At this point we were trying to get each picture to be as dark as possible so that each page was lit up. If each image was as dark as a black screen, then the page would have to be filled with black
