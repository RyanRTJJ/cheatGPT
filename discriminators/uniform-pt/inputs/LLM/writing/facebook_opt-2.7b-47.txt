  But if this isn't something you have experience with, there might be a long wait for an answer
I have a dream like that on a regular basis.  When I have the time (and my mind is clear and not cluttered), I write a story and post it.  It's usually about my dreams.
Oh, well that solves that question then. If you need to know the specifics, you can ask
Would I be able to share it here?
Sure, you can post it. The story is up to you. We're interested to see which stories you choose to share because dreams are amazing.
I am going to post my story about my dreams very soon I believe.  I will let you know what I think, good thoughts.
Alright
I wrote a story about the other night.  Thanks for your thoughts.  I hope you have lots of dream stories to write about.  I love them.
I feel like I could write an entire book about dream stories
Well, a book would be like 1000 pages.  But I have many dream stories on my phone, maybe I can add some of them to this if I ever have enough time to add more to all the stories I have saved.  I don't have a kindle for my stories I make.
Yeah that would be cool. If you have any android phones I could scan them to text you, that would be awesome
I don't but I would also like to add my original stories.  I am going to try and make it happen.  Are you still interested in my stories?  If you were, you have to let me know and I can get you the pictures off of my phone too
Yeah but I don't want to force you. It'll take me a while to put any of them together but if you're up for it, I'll be interested.  The kindle just gives a nice, cleaner version.
I wrote a whole story.  I got the pictures,
