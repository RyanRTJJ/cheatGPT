Can you get away with it? **********************************/ Once you start to fall for the "supervillain theme," you'll get to understand just how easy it was to get your head stuck into the whole "super villain" theme once you started coming from a background like this. It's almost as if every villain on this /d/ has been doing it for years and it's just getting you to think it is cool. Your "supervillain" is usually just some kid or a teenager who's made of cardboard and is making lots and lots of noise every second of the day. If you're really interested in the details on why you think these things are cool, read on. If you enjoy these prompts you might as well read them, because they might as well be here to serve as prompts for a novel, and you'd be surprised how good a novel it would be to read. I'll be honest though. I have no idea whether it will sell. I just want to get some feedback if you have any in the comments section. But I suppose that's better than me saying "hey hey here's some other novels out there that you might enjoy, and if you like them you might want to check out my novel" because then you can never publish them. ********************************** [F4F] [NC-SF] Your super villain: The big bad and your super hero: A date! A date! Super heroes have no romance, you know. They just take on the villains. This is the only one that's ever read
