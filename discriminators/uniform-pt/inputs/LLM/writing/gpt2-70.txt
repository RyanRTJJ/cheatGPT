!! It is impossible to take action until you know how to do it. When you are faced with a situation where you have to save the entire planet that way, let's go back to human nature and save the lives of others. In this case, we should look at these examples... and try to figure out what is working within that system to do it right. By not having a fixed approach from above, I mean the system that you are trying to control will inevitably change over time.

If we are not willing to step up to it to get them off balance with the best of intentions, the problem will continue to grow. Even if you cannot go for it, at least you get to watch what the machines do. This brings me back to my question... why doesn't the humans seem to seem to be at peace with their surroundings? There are a few things which could possibly make the system work a bit better, namely... but what is the overall point of using that knowledge? Is it enough to say that robots are safe?
