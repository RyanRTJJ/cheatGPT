_______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ My name is Joe. _______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ God is a very mysterious Creator. _______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ He has never revealed his 3 Dimensional world to us. _______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ I can't imagine how God could have given such an incredible creation to us and have never opened it. _______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ God has hidden from so many humans for so long. What a mystery God's 3 Dimensional world must be. To not allow any of us to open it. _______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ I can't stop thinking about God's 3 Dimensional world and 3 Doors. I just never had the nerve to touch the 3 Doors till now. Why? God has never opened the 3 doors yet. _______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ My friends ask me every day, why does Jesus have more followers than me? How is this possible? Why do I have 3 Doors instead of one? God never opens the 3 doors because God never reveals his 3 Dimensional world to ANYONE until his 3 doors are opened. _______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ I have 3 Doors and God has given me life eternal because I have 3 doors to the 3 dimensional world. You can't open God's 3 dimensional world because God never opens the 3 doors. God has more doors to the 3 door than there are days in an infinity year. God never opens the 3 doors because God's secret world is his creation. _______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ God never reveals his 3 dimensional world to anyone because he believes that people will not be able to understand the 3 Dimensional world and the way it works. God believes that the only way we can gain from what is in his 3 Dimensional World is to share our hearts with our friends. God never opens the 3 doors because if he did we would all be in a very difficult situation. God only opens the 3 Doors to the best man for the job.
