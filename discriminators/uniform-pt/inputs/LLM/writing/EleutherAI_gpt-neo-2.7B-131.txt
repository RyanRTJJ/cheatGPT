### You Were Here

This time you had to write a story about a person who was not necessarily at the place and time you were at the book's beginning.

### The Story

As you read this book from the start of the story, it looks like one person's life. You wonder, Where is he? Where is she? The question is really, Where is _everybody_?

When you get to the end of the book, you might find yourself at some point at those same points, wondering where everybody else was.

As you are reading this story, remember that it doesn't tell the whole story. It doesn't tell the story of where you were, for example, but also tells the story of where everyone else was and perhaps where they are now.

### The Rules

This has to be an original story! Remember, you don't want a story that sounds like one of those stories that is told everywhere but at school; it should be original. This is the only requirement: You won't be writing a traditional fairy tale.

So think about what it took to make you come up with this original.

This is a story that you need to set in the present. Think about what you know about what has happened to the people from your book up to now, and write this into your story. As much detail as you can get into your story! People know things about other people that they aren't telling to the people they meet in their daily lives. So, give your characters a good backstory, or backstory as much as you can get into. The more you can tell, the more your story will be original and the more it will surprise everybody. So make sure that you write about things that you yourself do not expect to learn about things or people in your life. Write
