 This gives you lots of room to put characters through situations that you know (or think you know) will happen in your story.  I think "Inherit the Fire" is the greatest and most important story ever written.
I think I know what you're talking about.  So, a story like this would be "Inherit the Fire?"  I think it's about some siblings that get inherited a castle in Germany during WWII, and then the war ends.  But I've read it in a different context before, could it be your story you're thinking of?
No, I've never read "Inherit the Fire," but I'm familiar with the structure of the writing.  It makes it so easy to write a story because you don't even have to *say* anything.  Just go in there and write.  See what the world is saying.  It makes writing an easy and natural process.
Interesting, that sounds awesome!  Is the story in any way a reflection of the writer's life?  How did you put it together?
No...I write stories for fun.  You don't have to write a story about your life if you don't want to.  Just sit down, write whatever comes into your head, and then see where it goes.  Write a thousand pages before you start deleting the ones you don't like. You'll find something to keep.
It's funny, when I think about my life (and it's not exactly full of events and happenings), this technique sounds easy.  Then again, I don't have a lot of time to do much of anything.  Hrm, I'll see where this gets me.
When someone tells me to write about something, I do not do well with this. I've already talked about my life, and I feel bad about it. Writing it just makes me go into more trouble and make my life seem even more depressing.   Edit: Wow, your username
