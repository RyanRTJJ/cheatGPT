  **_Michael Smith_** is an American screenwriter, director and producer, and has been writing and creating stories of heroic fantasy since his teenage years. He writes from a dark place of despair, anxiety, and inner conflict. He also believes that the darkest place on earth is on page with the words " _written_." Michael's favorite characters are the ones with no idea what it means to be human and the ones with the biggest hearts. Michael has been writing his stories for over four years. During that time, he has produced his first film, _The Adventures of the Little Ones,_ and worked on numerous television shows and movies featuring his characters. Michael has produced a number of short plays for his two children and a full fledged web project with over 25,000 subscribers. There is very little balance to Michael's life as a father and a husband and he is working on improving his health. He has been published in an eclectic number of magazines and online and he is currently writing a book for his own publishing company called _In the Company of Myself & Other Stories._ Michael lives in Los
