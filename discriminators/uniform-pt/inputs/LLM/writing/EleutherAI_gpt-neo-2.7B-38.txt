If any one doubts that the whole world believes that Jesus was a homosexual and in love with men, they need only take a look at the comments on the Internet. You can almost bet by the number and tone of them that the vast majority of them do.

The fact that the comments are mostly negative is proof positive that they believe that he was such.

Here is my own comment:

John 3:16 says that "if anyone loves Me, he will keep My words; and My Father will love them". You can be sure that I love men and I will keep your words.

I know who my father is. And you don't know who your father is, do you? Well, you may have some problems with who you really are, as with all of us.

I know that we all fall short of the best when we're called to do something for Christ. When I have to work for the Kingdom on this earth, I'm not going to make it easy on anybody. That's just not my way.

If you're not willing to trust me to be that kind of partner in your life, then you're really not all that serious about God and men being together. You're just making excuses to avoid working out whatever problem you have with sex
