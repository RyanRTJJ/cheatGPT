____________________________________________________________________________ As I looked at the crowd that filled the lobby, at my team, it occurred to me that life isn't that simple. Each and every time. The day I was born, I was given this opportunity to play. A chance to play any way I want. To be a part of this team, to compete, be better than my older brother. At times that day I was the team captain or the most popular guy. What we had was a privilege. To be given this opportunity is an honor. A challenge. For some players, it means starting at the bottom and rising up. For some, it means being the first to accomplish anything. For some it's the day that they are picked last in their grade. For some it's the day their parents are divorced. For some it's the day that they are the last to graduate high school. But it is always a journey. There are times where you fall, there are times where you rise up. But even at the highest of heights, we are all still just humans. Our mistakes, our mistakes will always be in the past. For all humanity. You have my promise, R.S.H. You will make mistakes. We all have. But your mistakes will always be in the past. I would like to give some credit here to the coaches, to their coaching staff. Their support, hard work, and patience has meant so much to me. Just for the other day it was Coach White here, he walked in and said to me, hey, you can stop playing. But your teammates, they all say you're not going to quit. So this night at the wedding was for you and your teammates. I'm just here to be with you guys. So my last word to you, don't give up on yourself. The people here will always be there. Always cheering for you. It's your time
