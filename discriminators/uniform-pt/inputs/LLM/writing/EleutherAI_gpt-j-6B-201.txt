All right, that's our story. I'm tired of being an elf, and I think you guys should know about it. I mean, this is our third tale; we've had our adventures, and we've had this whole life to live. Why go on?"

"That's a good question," replied Puck. "And it's been in the back of my mind ever since I first went outside. Have you ever considered the fact that we were created as mortals, but then the gods cast us out of paradise, exiled us from their garden, and made our lives a bit more complicated?"

"No, not really," said Asher. "The only thing that stuck out my head was that I was part elf and part human. Not that I'm complaining about it--it's not like I'm suffering under an entire year of it."

"But then I came across a book on my shelf about a girl who was living in a forest," continued Puck. "And she seemed to be the perfect mix of elfin and human, so I decided we should live in the woods like her. Then we found our way over to the North Pole and a strange door came open and we were greeted by this old god. And then my brother appeared and asked me to marry him and we all lived happily ever after."

I closed the cover of my journal and began to write. I knew my story wasn't the best one of the three, so it surprised me when I woke up in my bed that night and realized everyone had gone.

You can follow the adventures of the trio of Puck, Asher and me. We're called the Elves of Frostfield, and there are twelve of us, living in the North Pole. But we may be the only elves on Earth. This is our story....
