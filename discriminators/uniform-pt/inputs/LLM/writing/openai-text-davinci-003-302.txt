Once I turned 25, I officially stopped aging. I had gone through so much in my first 1,000 years of life, but each moment was special to me in its own unique way. 

I had heard about an ancient prophecy that would be revealed to me on the day I turned 25 and when the fateful day came, I heard a whisper that seemed to come from the heavens. It said, "You will either kill or be killed by another immortal." That day, I felt a chill run down my spine.

1,000 years later, I still have no idea who this other immortal is, nor have I found them. Until now.

It was 2017 and I had heard word of a lesser known immortal who had begun to make a name for himself in the world and I knew that this was the one I had been looking for all these centuries. He was a young man of 50, not even close to my 1,000 years and I realized right away that this was the one I had come across in the prophecy all those years ago. 

I had worried for so long about who this other immortal would be, yet here he was, almost mocking me with his youthfulness. I slowly made my way towards him and confronted him. I saw the fear in his eyes as he realized he was in the presence of another immortal, one who had been here for much longer than he had.

At first, I wanted to kill him, to rid him from this Earth and spare myself from the prophecy. But something held me back and I was just about to ask him why the prophecy said that I had to kill him or be killed by him when I collapsed to the ground and felt myself being pulled back into the world
