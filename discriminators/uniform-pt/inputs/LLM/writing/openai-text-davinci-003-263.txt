Sarah Roberts had always been a believer, but that belief was about to be tested. She was an amalgamation of excitement and fear as she entered the lab of Dr. Stevens. Everyone had been talking about his invention, and now she was about to experience it for herself.

Dr. Stevens instructed Sarah to place the device over her eyes. She could feel a tingling sensation as it activated. Suddenly, she found herself in a breathtaking realm of clouds and shiny stars. Sarah was enchanted. She had stumbled upon Heaven. She was in awe as she observed the oceans of angels, the softly glowing creatures, and their cheerful melodies that echoed endlessly.

Suddenly, she heard a voice. It was a voice unlike any she had ever heard before—powerful yet gentle, like the thunder of a distant storm. It was the Voice of God.

"Welcome, Sarah. I am pleased to meet you."

Overcome with emotion, Sarah wept tears of joy.

The experience was so overwhelmingly beautiful, it was almost too much to handle. Sarah left Dr. Stevens' lab feeling profoundly changed and more in touch with her faith than ever before.

But there were those who had taken a look at the other side of the device—those who had dared to gaze upon Hell. It was a dark, horrific place filled with smoke and fire and endless despair. Many of these people were left sleepless and shaken, needing the help of psychologists and psychiatrists for weeks or even months after.

Sarah thanked God for such an amazing experience...and prayed that she would never have to lay eyes on Hell.
