 In your panic you have run and hid, but your panicked footsteps have been heard by another pickpocket who decides to follow you.  This new pickpocket has gone right to chasing your scent and you're caught in the middle of a terrible duel you can't win.  You have 10 seconds to run away and try to escape, or the duel continues.  No matter what you do, it's a dead end.  What's your worst fear?  What are the reasons this nightmare is so terrible?  
What's your worst nightmare?  What are the reasons that this nightmare is so terrible?  It is my promise to you that your worst nightmares will become reality.  
So I know they are scary, but you have one extra day to tell me your worst nightmare.  If your nightmare is not on the list, comment below.  Please comment and let's get some horror out of the way.  This list is by no means definitive.  If we were going to write 50+ lists, we would write 50+ horror novels.  We'd leave out everything else.  It'd be like saying if we were going to find 50 ways to die right now, we would also find 50 ways to die at dawn.  I'm not saying I'm going to write some of these.  I'm saying I'm very curious as to where someone was going with this.  
I promise this is not some weirdo list.  Some people have some things they would rather deal with than others.  For example, being stuck in a dark tunnel for four days and your lungs are killing you and you have to go find a cure...
And then you get to the end and, no, you do not die.  Well, after all, you already had a 50 foot tunnel up your ass all along.  So what if you died in the tunnel - what would you rather do?  I'll bet my last penny you'd rather go back to the beginning.  That's my problem with all these
