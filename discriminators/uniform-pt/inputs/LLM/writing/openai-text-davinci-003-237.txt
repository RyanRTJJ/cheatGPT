Once upon a time there was a hero too good to be true. With admirable dexterity and strength, she kept the city safe from all sorts of trouble. But the price of being a hero was immense. It meant constantly putting on a perfect front and repressing her own needs and wants for the sake of keeping the peace.

One night, after yet another tiring patrol of the city, the hero cracked. Instead of helping someone out, she decided to do whatever she wanted, no matter the consequences â€“ and this meant becoming a villain.

The hero's sidekick noticed the change almost immediately. Where before his friend had been quick to help others, she now seemed dismissive and cruel. He wanted to talk it out with her and make her see reason but he wasn't sure if he would make it in time.

When he finally confronted her, the hero was unapologetic. She saw no reason to be a hero any longer. Emboldened by her newfound freedom, she refused to stop her villainous activities.

The sidekick was devastated. He had grown so attached to the hero and had loyalty to her. But more than that, he cared about the numerous innocent people she was impacting by her actions.

Still, he couldn't bring himself to end her newfound reign of terror. He looked at her, broken and pondering, and for the first time he saw the immense toll being a hero had taken on her. She was wracked with exhaustion, the world had become too much for one person to bear.

The sidekick stepped forward and made a promise to her. He promised to be her partner, to help her when she needed it and to be a constant reminder of the responsibility and idea of being a hero
