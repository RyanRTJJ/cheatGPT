 You should do some preliminary research.  (The Internet is great for research, and finding what you need)  Write about a situation in which you know someone or something is pretending to be another person.  (Maybe you're the person pretending to be McCain?)  When you've got a good story outline, consider what the end result should look like.  (A story that begins with John "I'm John" or "John is" is not very interesting.)  It helps to picture an alternate reality.  What would it be like if John turned out not to be Senator McCain?  What would it be like if John turned out to be someone else?  How does being someone else feel?  What might that person be like?

A short time later:

John has decided to put up a sign at the local grocery store.  He suggests that it could say "John McCain" next to the name of the shop.

What would you use to replace the word "John McCain" with the name of the shop?  Can you think of any other names that are a better match to the original statement than McCain?

The story is over!  You're the winner!

  1. I'm John
  2. John is
  3. Senator John McCain
  4. I'm John McCain
  5. John may be a senator
  6. I am John McCain
  7. John is John McCain

 _Journals_ vs. _Notes and Questions_

**_What's your biggest problem with writing fiction?  
Or what is your biggest problem writing in general?_**

Here is a simple little experiment you can try.  Instead of writing about your usual everyday problems, try to write a journal entry.  Think of it as an opportunity to practice writing about other people.  
If you choose a day which works for you, you don't even need a journal.  If you choose something different with the right circumstances, then by all means, keep a journal.  You might
