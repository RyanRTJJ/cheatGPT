There I stood, in the presence of Death, one of the most powerful entities in existence, and I told them I would never tire of living, no matter how long I lived. Death, being the gambler that they are, made me a bet - if I could prove to them that I would never tire of living, they would grant me true immortality. 

Knowing there was no way to win, I still accepted their bet. Little did I know, I would prove to be the exception to the rule. Over the course of an unimaginable amount of time, I experienced the rise and fall of civilizations, eagerly embraced new technologies, and grew alongside the universe, never tiring of existence. 

Death and the other powerful entities could only watch in awe as I outlasted several universes, each of them ending in a glorious final death, as I continued living. Then it happened - after the second death of the universe, I spoke to Death once again and told them that I still held true to my claim, that I would never tire of living. They could only stand there in bewilderment, baffled by my longevity and unwavering faith.

In that moment, made true on their own words, Death granted me true immortality. I would not age, nor get sick. My existence was now ceaseless, and yet I never got tired of it. I was the exception to the rule, and even Death had finally met their match.
