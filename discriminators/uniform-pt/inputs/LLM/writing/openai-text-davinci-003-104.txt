I was raised to know that life was all about getting as close to number one as possible. Even though it was never talked about openly, we all knew that was the goal. It was the only way to happiness and success. I knew that I was number 22 when I was born and that I had to find a way to make it to the top spot, number one.

I used every opportunity that I had to make my number move up. I worked hard at school, volunteered in my free time and made sure that I was involved in everything I could. I knew that no matter how hard I worked, I wouldn’t be able to move up to number one unless numbers ahead of me die or get killed. It was a morbid thought, but I knew it was the only way.

One day, I heard a rumor that number 15 had died in a car crash. I couldn’t believe it. It was one of the only times that I got a boost and skipped several numbers in the queue. Soon after, number 10 was involved in a fatal accident. I couldn’t believe it. I had jumped up 12 spaces in my position.

It was getting close to my dream of getting to number one. I couldn’t help but feel a sense of joy knowing that my position was getting closer, but I felt a deep sadness for those who had died and the families they had left behind. It had been a hard road, but I was finally getting closer to the coveted number one spot. I was number seven.
