  Not exactly what you wanted I know but it's one of my favorite Sci-fi stories of all time.
I actually wrote something very similar to this and I’m glad to hear someone’s done it before.   What I wrote would be a bit different. Humanity is no longer threatened in their galaxy and a great deal of peace prevails. But they’re still at war with the aliens.
There's a good book called Hyperion where both races are in the middle of a civil war where the humans are faring much better than the aliens and they just help each other out. They all live happily ever after for the rest of the story.
Oooooh I remember that book! I read one chapter. I liked it except that he described in detail how humans rape the aliens to win wars. It was unnecessary and disturbing, and the aliens who did that seemed cold and uncaring to me.   I think I’ll give it another shot!
The rest is definitely not as graphic.
Ah, okay. That would be a bit annoying if it didn’t show in later books. I think I might have to just read those first.
The rest is also very much on its own. After a while, the human chapters stop being about the war and are just two guys talking. The aliens are all about the war. It's pretty cool.
This sounds incredibly, incredibly exciting.   EDIT: just finished the series today. It was definitely something different. I think I might even like it a bit more now that I understand the dynamics of war (or at least better know who wins).   But... I just don’t know how I feel about the
