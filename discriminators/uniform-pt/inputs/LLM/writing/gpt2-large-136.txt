 in which someone is born with a negative soul. It is a small country in the north-western tip of Europe, and with population of just about 400,000, it is one of the wealthiest countries in Europe. It's always been a place people have wanted to go and that remains the case, even with the rising costs of living. However, as a result of overpopulation and an ever-climbing tax and public spending demands, the local government does all in its power to ensure that these souls are not born. While everyone does like the idea of a happy life there are drawbacks as well: The population is increasing, the demand for public infrastructure and transportation increases, the population is getting older, the people working there are losing pay and there's the constant fear of having the local population turn around and murder their loved ones.
