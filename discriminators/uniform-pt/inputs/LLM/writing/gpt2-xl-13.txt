__________________________________________________________ Hey, I'm writing the same for the Universe and the World but for a different Universe and with a different World... Just write about one of them. Maybe you can draw one of them. I have some drawings of the Universe. I have some others. There's a really cool one. I have a few more just like that and maybe a couple that are from a specific book (like a Star Trek book), but I'll get to that next week. Hope you like it. --- Hi there! Here is one for a Universe and a World.
