You know you've had dreams. 
You know your mind is as creative as your body, and if you forget a dream suppressant - 
you have no idea what kind of dreams you dream, but you will see some 
pretty weird images - 
with a lot of screaming... 
The first time it happened, 
you said, "I want to have a night with my dreams, I don't want them to bother anybody but me - no need 
for anyone else to get hurt." 
The next two times, 
you said, "Let me decide for myself about the things in my dreams. 
Let me have a night with my dreams," 
so you decided to start to take your dream suppressants twice a day. 
The next three times, 
you said, "You know, this dream suppressant is not making my dreams go away or anything like that." 
And then the next three times - 
you said, "You know, I really don't see the point of making you take this 
suppression anymore and I'm gonna tell you why." 
Because when you start to tell people about your dream, 
and they start to take your dream suppressants, 
you feel like everything in your body 
or your mind that should be there is not. 
And for them, that's not a relief because if everything in the body you know is gone, then 
things they want in their dreams are gone. 
So you start to feel a little weird, 
but you don't start to feel like everything around you 
or the world, 
if it's turned off again 
everything is a relief. 
And you decide one day, 
"You know, I'll stop taking this suppressant. 
Tomorrow I'll wake up 
and I'll be normal." 
And at that moment, 
you say, "Maybe I should come clean with my dreams and open them up 
a little more. Maybe I'll be able to have a moment 
where I'll have my
