The sun was up and I was wide awake, yet something felt different this morning. I had the same feeling I had the day before I died. 

I got ready for the day, but everything seemed off. I had felt like this for weeks now, but this day felt particularly strange. 

I drove to work and I couldn't shake the premonition. I had a sinking feeling deep in my gut and I knew something was going to happen. 

When I arrived at work, my colleagues didn't seem to notice anything wrong. That's when I knew something was really off. I knew what was going to happen. 

Sure enough, an hour later, the unimaginable happened. I died. 

Soon after, I awoke to the day before I died. I couldn't believe it. This had happened to me before. I had re-experienced the day before my death three times before, and each time I tried to change my fate, yet it was all in vain. 

As the day progressed, I lived every second like it was my last. I said goodbye to my loved ones in case I never came back. 

At the end of the day, I had a feeling of deja vu. I knew what was coming, and that nothing I could do would stop it. 

The next day, I died again. 

Since then, my family and I have tried to figure out why this keeps happening to me, yet the answer remains a mystery. I guess all I can do is keep living each day to the fullest and hope that one day, I'll be able to break this cycle.
