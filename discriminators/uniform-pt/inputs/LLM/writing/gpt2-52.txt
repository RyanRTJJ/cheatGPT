 This story is about the way in which he had a very limited form and his ability to communicate.  He can't be sent to his grave; he would have to find the land of the damned on his own, where he and his family could have a home and the means to escape his mortal destiny.  He has a love for his family and his best friends, but this is an old story of tragedy and tragedy. And he needs the rest: He needs his daughter, whom he has grown to love as many times as he can live, in order to live a happier and healthier life.  It is a story of redemption and loss.
Now, you know what I'm trying to say when I announce my plans to create "Mountain Stories".  It's all about the best of what is available, and the best experience.  I'd like to tell all of my supporters and friends about what I am planning to accomplish with this book by giving you the details of what each topic is.  As you can tell, I haven't finished every blog post or book; and then I'm going to go about blogging about a lot of things while I focus on Mountain Stories.  I will do "Roadmap" blog posts in the next few days ("Roadmap I wrote" blogs), but after those blog posts I will stop and finish this book.  So enjoy my writing, my words, and the best of what you get.  And please enjoy this book for the rest of your life.
