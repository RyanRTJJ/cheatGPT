Once upon a time there was a beautiful land, with a brave and noble hero who served its people alongside his beloved princess. But when their kingdom was threatened by a powerful evil force, their only option was to make the ultimate sacrifice - the hero lay down his life and the princess was offered up to appease the force.

Though the kingdom fell into the hands of the evil king, the people of the land retained their spirit and courage. The new ruler was determined to prove his power and authority, and proceeded to make several oppressive regulations in order to maintain control.

But despite the harshness of the regulations, the people were strangely content with their new ruler. They quickly realized that he was much more compassionate to those under his rule. The people were provided with food, housing, and education, which had been scarce under the rule of the previous leaders.

Eventually, the people's lives improved so much that they began to call the evil king the "benevolent ruler". With their newfound security and stability, the people peacefully accepted the rule of the evil king and his regulations, and ultimately began to view him as a savior.

The memory of the brave hero and the beloved princess lived on in the hearts and minds of the people, and their ultimate sacrifice was not in vain. Despite their deaths, the people of the beautiful land prospered, and their courage and perseverance ensured that their kingdom could survive the darkness.
