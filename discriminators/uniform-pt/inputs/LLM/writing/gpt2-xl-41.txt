My best friend is not my enemy.
A woman of honor is not an easy woman to love. She is smart and fierce and full of the most beautiful and interesting truths of being.  She is kind, gentle and understanding of that which is not her own.  Sometimes she makes mistakes, but those mistakes are also rare. However, in this world a woman of honor seems to be most often ignored or overlooked. In truth that is very fortunate for her.  It allows me to look into her heart and see that she is trying as hard as she can to be respected, loved and protected.  For women such as this, those who seek to lead and guide humanity by example, the need for honor is not nearly so important. She has nothing to prove to others, nor is anything to prove to herself. She is content to do what needs to be done, with the hope that the world will see her qualities and remember that she is a good person who deserves our respect for what she has done and is doing. While her actions have their costs, their rewards and for good reason. What she has endured in her life is nothing short of phenomenal, far exceeding the expectations of most men. A hero is someone who is honored for their sacrifices.  These sacrifices include and include everything.  And a woman of honor is honored for everything her actions require from the men she loves.  When she goes on a rescue mission, she goes with men of much greater respect than those she rescues.  If she becomes an activist, working to improve the world for the people she loves, she does so with greater respect for herself and for the men who work alongside of her as her allies. When she is at the forefront of making a difference, she makes sure her voice is heard and recognized for her efforts, even when there are no men around.  My favorite
