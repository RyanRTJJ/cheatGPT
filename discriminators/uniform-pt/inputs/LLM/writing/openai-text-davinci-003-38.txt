It was a typical September evening - I had just finished picking up my kids from school, and we were unwinding with a cool glass of Kool-Aid. We settled into our cozy living room and I put on a movie for the kids as I started organizing some papers at the desk in the corner. Suddenly, I noticed a strange figure in the darkness of the room.

He was wearing a dark hoodie and a pair of glasses and he seemed to be looking for something. At first I was terrified - this was like something out of a horror movie. I quickly made sure my kids were safe, but the figure had already moved closer to me. His hands reached out for the glass of Kool-Aid sitting on my desk and he grabbed it, just before I could react. He then turned and fled the room, vanishing into the night.

At that moment, I knew I was being robbed. My kids were safe, but I was still shaken by what had just happened. I called the police right away, but when they arrived all they could do was take a report. There were no clues to who this mysterious figure was and no way of tracking him down.

It didn't take long though, the following day I started getting reports of a man at the local convenience store complaining that someone had stolen his Kool-Aid. He had mentioned that he left it on his desk - and sure enough, it matched the description of the glass I had seen being taken away. I shared my story with the police and the officer put out a description of the thief.

My Kool-Aid was eventually recovered and the thief was caught
