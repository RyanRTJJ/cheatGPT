Irena was awakened by the bright morning sun that filtered through her thin white curtains. She smiled as she thought about the day ahead. It was going to be a perfect day.

She rose and re-arranged her dark brown curls before heading into the kitchen to begin her day. As she reached for the tea tin on the shelf, her eyes were drawn to the window, where the sun rallied to shower colorful blooms through the glass. Irena allowed herself to breathe it in.

After breakfast, Irena decided to take a stroll. She pulled on her favorite yellow dress and lace-up boots, grabbed her straw hat and a book and headed out.

At the park, Irena spent the day basking in the sunlight, chatting with friends and reading. She watched the birds flittering and a squirrel racing up the nearby tree, and exhaled with contentment.

As the afternoon rolled in, the sun began to set, painting the sky in a fiery array of hues. Irena watched the horizon until the stars peeked through and twinkled.

Irena walked home in the twilight, feeling energized, fulfilled and deeply content.

It was indeed a perfect day.
