Get off the catwalk and find Rhea, who wants to talk, so do but wait to talk to her for a while. Once you've talked to her, head through the door behind her and speak with her again. It's ok, and she seems just fine to talk to you so go back through the door you just went through. She'll then give you her key to a little cave, just in front of the dock. Inside you'll find the Heart Shriveler. ________________________________________________________________________________ \ Rhea / |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯| | Weak: Light P.
