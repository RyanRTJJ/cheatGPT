(First Day of Exile)

Today I am beginning my exile, sent on this journey as punishment for malicious acts I'm not proud of. It's been made clear to me that I'm required to remain in this wilderness for 20 years, and must make my own way in order to survive.

I'm not sure what will become of me here, but I have to take a few deep breaths and remember that I can do this. My feelings of fear, anxiety and sorrow have not left me yet, but I have to push them away and stay focused on the positives.

In this moment I have to remember that I'm still alive, and able to make the best of a difficult situation. I must do whatever I can to survive this lonely period of exile.

(Last Day of Exile)

Today marks the end of my 20 years of exile. I'm glad to be finished with the restrictions placed on me, but I'm also feeling a bit apprehensive. During my time in this wilderness I've learned how to survive on my own, and I'm struggling to imagine life without having to rely solely on myself.

It's strange that such a sad situation has ultimately been a blessing in disguise. I'm certain that my struggles to persevere here will serve me well in the future.

The experience has changed me in ways that I'm still discovering, and I hope that I can apply the lessons I've learned to create a better future. I'm ready to leave this wilderness, and to see what the world has in store for me.
