______________________________________________________________________________ I do not own Frozen, nor do I speak for anyone I have contracted this virus from. And I'm sick just thinking about it. I do not intend to post links for this story in any other place. Any such site would be a criminal act against me. I'm just offering for their safekeeping the following story in an effort to put your minds at rest and let you relax. Enjoy! ______________________________________________________________________________

You don't have to look very far to find a way to read this story. It's all there, in the form of lines that sound just like these lines that were added to Ice Prince's mind when he first realized it. This story is a one shot, at first, written by myself, Ice Princess, only this one will be more than a story. It's a work in progress, with many pieces that I've cut out, and many sections that I haven't gotten around to putting them back in. I'm sure you can tell how much work came away from this idea, if you watch the original Ice Prince story. But now we're talking about something completely different, something I've dreamed about for years. It's a story to change your mind with once in a while, and not just once. You are not the enemy. I'll give you that. There's going to be blood and suffering and terror and regret this time around. That's all it is. That's all the story is. ______________________________________________________________________________

This means you have my permission to go read this. Do and play as much as you like.

If you're ready to play the game but just are not feeling fully immersed, you should also read through the first section before reading the rest, and start over again on your own. I'm guessing most of
