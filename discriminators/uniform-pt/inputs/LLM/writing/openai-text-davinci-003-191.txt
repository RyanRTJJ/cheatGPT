Earth had been long forgotten, a distant memory without relevance or consequence in the ever-expanding galaxy. As time went on, countless civilizations had been born, prospered and died as was common throughout such a vast universe.

However, not all were created equal and certainly not all had the same level of common sense. It wasn't until they made contact with Humanity that they could fully appreciate such a concept. The Human race was the only species in the galaxy with such a peculiar and immense lack of common sense that they actually required laws and regulations to form their societies.

Most of the other societies had ended up forming naturally, requiring only a modicum of leadership, but when Humaity presented their laws and regulations, several were left shocked and aghast. Humanity wasn't willing to budge on their rules and regulations no matter how primitive they seemed and it didn't take long for the other civilizations to realize that this was a fundamental part of their culture.

However, despite their seemingly strange ways, Humanity went on to form one of the most powerful and influential societies in the galaxy. The other civilizations were amazed by their tenacity and ability to overcome and to some, Humanity provided an example to follow.

Humanity had indeed brought something to the galaxy which no other species had before them; a lack of common sense which led to the creation of laws and regulations that allowed them to create one of the most powerful societies known to the universe.
