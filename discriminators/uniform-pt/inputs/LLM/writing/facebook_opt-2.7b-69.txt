 You wouldn't even need any plot as long as it has interesting and plausible details.
Okay, that's interesting too. But how would this character exist in the same fictional universe as the one the prompt takes place in? Or am I just tripping?
He's part of the same universe as any other characters that are born. In other words, the universe of all reality. The same can happen to any of the characters. He can exist within any world, including the universe which contains the story.
Oh shit, it all makes sense now. So this world's timeline contains the real Earth, in which people are born and live in it. I don't want to make this about a guy who's not even necessarily dead, but I don't think I want to make it about someone either. Thanks for telling me! :)
I understand. This is really hard to visualize. Imagine a situation where some scientists are searching the internet for a way to travel back in time. They don't find a way so they just decide to experiment in the future, hoping that something could work. That's the gist of it.
I can imagine it now but it isn't right. I will write it more as you want though, and thanks for telling me what I can do. It means a lot! :)
No problem man, glad i could help. Happy writing!
Hey dude just want to say thank you for helping me with my story. I really appreciate it!
And it's no problem. Tell me how it went. You don't have to if you don't want to. And if you do, i'll be sure to read it.
Thanks man! I'll send it when it's finished. Hopefully it ends up in a good place!
