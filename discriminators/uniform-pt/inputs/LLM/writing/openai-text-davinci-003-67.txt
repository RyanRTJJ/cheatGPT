Cain knew he had done something terrible, yet as he looked upon his brother's lifeless form, he could not bring himself to feel guilt or remorse. He had heard voices in his head, commanding him to do it, and so he had.

God looked down from Heaven and saw what had transpired. He felt sorrow for his sons and for the world that was about to experience death for the first time. He knew this was a necessary evil, so he looked to one of His angels.

"Kadriel, you are the chosen one who will be the first Angel of Death," God said solemnly.

Kadriel was taken aback. He had no experience of death, for there had been noOne to take away life until now. How was he to do this?

God read his thoughts and answered his question. "You must learn as you go. Death is different in Heaven and Earth, and you are the one to bring it to the latter."

Kadriel bowed his head in acceptance. He understood his duty and accepted it without question. He spread his wings and soared to Earth, ready to learn the ways of death and become the first Angel of Death.
