Natalie had always been a dreamer, and when she heard about the magical kingdom deep in the woods, she knew she had to explore. After filling her pockets with food and her head with stories, she set off into the forest. 

Hours later, Natalie found the magical kingdom. Even in her wildest dreams, she had never imagined something so full of color and life. She watched in wonder as birds of all sizes and colors flew gracefully through the sky and animals of all shapes and sizes wandered around. Trees seemed to come alive, blooming with an array of colors and swaying in the wind as if they were dancing. Everywhere Natalie looked, there was something new and exciting to see. 

As Natalie took in the beautiful sights around her, she heard a hushed voice whisper, “Don’t blink, or you’ll miss it.” Natalie was about to ask what the voice meant, when suddenly the whole forest shimmered and vanished. She found herself alone in the woods, the only proof that the magical kingdom had ever existed was an envelope of bright petals at her feet.

Natalie sighed in disbelief and returned home. But ever since that day, when she passes by the same woods, Natalie glances quickly at the trees in the hopes that the magical kingdom will make a return, if only for a few brief moments.
