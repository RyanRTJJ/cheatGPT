I nervously clutched my sword hilt, sizing up the peculiar folks standing before me. A stern-looking paladin devoted to RNGesus, a bulky muscle wizard, an arrogant ass of a thief, and me, serving as the party's oddball wildcard. What an interesting bunch of characters.

Before I had time to consider our radical dynamic, the paladin announced our mission: infiltrate a dangerous underground laboratory, abscond with a powerful artifact and make off with it before the denizens of the cursed labyrinth discovered our treachery. An uneasy silence descended upon the group, yet each made ready for the task ahead.

Within minutes we had entered the sewers beneath the lab and were inching ever closer to our objective. Everything was going according to plan, yet I couldn't help but worry that the unlikely combination of our party members would prove to be our undoing. Sure enough, we made it to the final chamber before the muscle wizard made a fatal misstep in the dark and badly injured his leg. The Paladin hurriedly applied what healing spells he knew, yet it was too late.

We had no choice but to leave him in the sewers and press on without him - a decision I knew our wizard wouldn't take lightly. It seemed that the situation had been doomed to fail from the start. In hindsight, having a party composed of a devout believer in RNGesus, a muscle wizard, an a-hole thief and me, a "wildcard", wasn't going to work out in the end.
