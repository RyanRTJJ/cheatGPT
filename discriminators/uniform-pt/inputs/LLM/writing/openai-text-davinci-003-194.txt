Shannon smiled warmly across the table at her date, feeling comfortable in his presence. She felt like she could be herself and that she was finally ready to move on from her old relationship. Conversation was easy, and it seemed that he had the same interests and goals that she did. They shared deep laughs, and had already made plans for a second date.

Everything was going great... until Shannon made a huge mistake. She brought up her ex and the effect it had on their relationship. The mood instantly changed and she wanted to take her words back. She wanted to run away in embarrassment, but instead she sat there silently with her cheeks red and tears in her eyes.

It seemed like this might be the end of the date when suddenly she got a message. It was from future her, a sign that seemed to come out of thin air. "Don't screw this up," it read. "He's the one."

Shannon was amazed and filled with hope. She took a deep breath and wiped away her tears. She reminded herself that she wasn't perfect, that no one is perfect, and that sometimes you have to take risks.

She apologized for bringing up her ex, and re-opened the conversation. They talked a bit more, eventually making their way back to the easiness they had before. By the time they said goodnight, the evening felt salvaged and as if it had even surpassed the potential Shannon first thought it had.

Now, with this sign from the future, Shannon knew that she should take the risk and follow her heart. She was sure that this was the person she wanted to share her life with.
