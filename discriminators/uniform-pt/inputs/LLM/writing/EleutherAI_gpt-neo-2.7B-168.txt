 She then becomes convinced that the character is a fraud, and proceeds to attempt to sabotage his plans by lying about everything he does, and thus sabotages his plans.  She then realizes that the character actually would work out to his fullest capacity, and is happy about it.  The NPC returns to tell the player character this... and then he has to confront the truth with his current character, rather than his past self.

Some common traits of the players who ask are:

They already know to look.  This is usually due to some experience that demonstrates they know nothing about solving the problem they feel they have.
They're already used to having answers that don't fit. (Most often they have been given answers from other people that don't fit, or answers from other sources that aren't true of their current situation.)
They have never faced a problem like it. (In fact, they have never faced most of life's problems.)
They've seen other people who've faced it and come out OK. (In fact, at least one of them has come out OK. But they are not so used to people who did not.)
They have had more success with other similar problems. (In fact, they have had success and are now stuck with the same kind of problem.)
They want a new approach to a similar problem.

Note, there's no guarantee they'll get one!  All you need is the confidence to think it's worth the energy it might take to implement someone's suggestion to your character.
