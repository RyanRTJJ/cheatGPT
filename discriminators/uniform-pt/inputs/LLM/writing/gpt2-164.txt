 You don't feel the same feelings of inadequacy when you feel the same way as you felt when going to class. It sounds cool and interesting, but you just keep hearing about how "damn horrible" your classmates are. But what if, when looking at you as a person who stands out from the crowd at school, you start worrying about whether you could put up with the same high school crush the "normal kid" is facing? Well, you might.
You're the kid in the white school's "P" class. The kids you hear talking about are the same age as you.
Then, this is where all the "dangerous" kids get scary. Their faces are totally different than yours. You see, you've got a different, stardustier, or "realistic" life style. You've done some really cool things, like going to the beach and being an alchemist, or going to college in the city or being a musician. These are all things that could possibly get you killed in a fight. But these are a few things.   A 1 would be the "usual" life. A 1-2 would be a 'normal' life. A 1-3 would not be the normal one. A 1-4 would be the high school equivalent of a college graduate and a regular student. They all have something in common, something that you might not always know.  
No matter your level of "risk," at any standard (but for "dangerous," you need to do about 8 to 12 tests), you would not be under any other kind of control. No matter how your life is portrayed in the media, you wouldn't be held as humanly as you could be without the people who will do the manipulating, and the people you will have to work with until you get over being "damned awesome"
