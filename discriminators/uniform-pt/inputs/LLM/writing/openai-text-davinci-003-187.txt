When Jamie was a child, he was considered to be an oddball among his friends. He was often alone and kept to himself, leaving the rest of the kids feeling awkward and excluded. But it wasn't until his teenage years that he discovered why he was so different from the others.

One day, Jamie was playing in the park with some friends when a chance accident caused him to suddenly unleash a strange power he never knew he had. An incredible energy seemed to spread out from within him and whoever he was looking at was suddenly completely under his control. He quickly realized he had the power to influence people's decisions without them even knowing it.

At first, Jamie felt this power was a blessing. He had an understanding of people he never had before and it seemed his loner ways had suddenly made some sense. He was scared but also excited.

But soon, Jamie encountered an unexpected challenge. He started to fall in love with a certain someone but he was always left wondering if this person liked him of their own free will. He knew that if he used his power he could force them to be with him but he also knew it wasn't right. He wanted to be sure that this person truly liked him as much as he liked them.

So, instead of using his powers to manipulate, Jamie kept his distance and kept his powers hidden. He knew no one could ever love him for who he was and that his power was too dangerous to let anyone know the truth. He watched from afar, happy to enjoy their company
