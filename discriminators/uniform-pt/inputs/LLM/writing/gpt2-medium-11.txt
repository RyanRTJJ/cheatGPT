It's also possible that there's more to discover within these posts! Send a PM telling me that you found something or added something! Or try to get to the bottom of something! What's your favorite thing about the place you're taking pictures? What could this be on the map you're looking at? Is there something that you haven't answered but should know? Please get in touch with me if you have any trouble, I'd love to help! Also, if you have a good picture from before my time on Earth or you have an idea for an awesome shot, message me and I'll try to add that here! :D _________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________ 1) What planet will I be taking photos from? If you didn't know, the world is named for it's planet. The most common number in the system is 0, with 10 being the least commonly used. The rest of the system is random (it could be a gas giant that has had an orbit about 4 days long). Some people will say that it wouldn't work, because as a new world is being created it is a little more distant from Earth, it will be a little harder for light to reach the surface and the light will be different than we would see if we were on Earth. Another question we're trying to answer is: What planet will be there next? There's another planet (or at least some orbiting ones) that has a similar gravity so it might work, but I'll have to do a little analysis to figure out if it takes us into the solar system :) Also, some satellites that we're looking at are orbiting in another star system, and I'm
