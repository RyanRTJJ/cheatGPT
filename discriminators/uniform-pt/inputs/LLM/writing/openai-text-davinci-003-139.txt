One day an idea for a novel popped into his head, an idea that would take him by surprise.

To his surprise and horror, as he studied the world of the future, he began to realize something incredibly disturbing. The world he was writing about was one that bore an uncanny resemblance to the one he lived in today. As he continued writing, he found that the dystopian society he had created was almost identical to the one he was living in right now.

Henry was horrified, confused, and a little bit scared of what he had written. He wasn't sure if he should publish this story as he was sure that people wouldn't take it too kindly.

He was pleased when the novel was well-received. People began talking about it and the themes it raised. People started to discuss and debate the merits of the world he had written about and soon it was the topic of discussion in many discussions, debates and talks.

100 years later, the novel still stands as an important and influential text that shaped how people thought about
