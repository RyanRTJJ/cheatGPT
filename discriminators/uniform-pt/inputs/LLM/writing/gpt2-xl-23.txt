 On the other side of the conflict, a country by the name of the Holy Roman Empire, is fighting a seemingly endless war in the other direction.  It has been there for ages and has only recently begun to realize that while its enemies around the world have been making great strides, there will always be a large population living in the other side that would like to see it fall to dust.  In order to keep up their front line on the ground, they have had to adopt a few other tricks: They have had to develop a system of transporting soldiers that has allowed them to mass produce weapons of war. They have been using their technology to manipulate the weather around them, which they believe has been very beneficial to their people.  So far, the US and UK have been winning their fight, but their enemy intends to soon win their own back.  To help them do that, they take an old, familiar piece of their enemy's technology:  electricity.  The US has a massive electrical grid that allows them to use electricity to transmit power around the world with a speed and efficiency no other country has ever done.  Meanwhile, the UK is very different, having only begun to move to do this 20ish years ago.  This is because of the time it takes power to work.  For every hour worth of power there is a minute of lag in the power distribution network.  And the longer it takes for power to be delivered, the longer the power grid has to be to work.  The Holy Romans are at a critical point because the Holy Roman Empire has had to start finding new ways of getting power to their people.  They have found that the best way to use electricity is to be able to build great power plants that draw from the energy grid for free.  They have begun building these power plants and are now working on better ways to operate them as well as the power consumption they have to get rid of. Unfortunately, they're faced with a problem that no one in their right mind wants to go
