She looked around her, wondering why this particular train was moving on these abandoned, useless tracks. The rails had been mangled and bent, the metal corroded and rusted, it seemed unlikely that anything of value could be taken from here. But as she held her breath and positioned her hand on her hips, she clearly heard the loud and buzzy hum of a locomotive getting closer and closer. 

Then, as if repeating a ghostly chant, a headlight shone in the dark and silently illuminated the railroad tracks. She quickly hurried back, not from fright but from sheer curiosity and astonishment. As the locomotive passed by, she was mesmerized by itâ€™s beauty and grandeur. Even through the darkness, She could make out the grand caboose, the colorful wagons adorned with trailing letters and the magnificent steam engine at the front. 

The train lightly and gracefully moved along the rails, it traveled far passed her and yet, into her mind.

As the train faded away in the distance, She thought to herself that maybe this train wasn't so useless after all... That maybe it was so helpful in ways she could never even imagine. 

She then took a deep breath of the cool, evening air and walked away with a spark of hope in her heart, feeling inspired by the beauty of what was once to be considered useless.
