I think she would have had a lot of practice with her abductors had she spent a few weeks growing up in one.

I agree with @Jabberwocky who said'she had a lot of practice'.
But it's more than that, she could understand them enough.  The aliens could communicate with her in her own tongue if they were to get bored with her, or her captors.  That might be a very interesting story.

A:

In an RPG, she'd have had to learn their language (obvious) and their culture from scratch, and they might have been able to teach her a few things. 
For example: they might have made her an object for public display for some period, and there might have been some kind of market attached that would have people paying to view her through the glass or whatever barrier.
If she had a bit of time and a lot of patience to hang around a few of these "possible future" visitors, she could be exposed to a little or a lot of alien culture and develop a decent understanding of it. After that, a few days of practice, and she'd probably be fluent and able to hold conversations (and perhaps even start a game of her own!)

 If this ever happens to you as a real human in a real, real life sci-fi setting, you could possibly get taken, and it might take a while to adjust (and might be worth doing to make a more interesting plot). 

 This of course assumes: a) no government mind control; b) no "capture" in the sense that they get a few hours to talk at you while you learn their language and their attitudes; c) if you're being forced to work with them, there's not much you can do, and the only thing that has any chance of working is a "time out"
