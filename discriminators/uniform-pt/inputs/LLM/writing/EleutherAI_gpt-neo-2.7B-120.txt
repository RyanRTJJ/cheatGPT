a short story

Chapter 5 (This is the beginning of the end).



The old man sat in the shade of a tree, staring down at the world of earth that seemed like an unfinished puzzle that couldn't be solved. He couldn't really know why he was there since the others of his generation had been in the military for at least twenty years but he felt as though he had wasted his life. In fact, he might feel better if he just kept on living. He had never been able to hold down a job or have any significant relationship since a girl he started seeing in college had abandoned him in the middle of their love. He had always been there when someone was needing him during the day but he was useless at night and he always thought about taking the time to actually look for the perfect man to love him or maybe the perfect wife. He had done what he could to fulfill his life's purpose as far as sex and romance were concerned and he couldn't really understand why.

He looked down at his old, worn-out shoes before moving down from the ground and taking to his feet. The rain was a welcome break for a man who no longer felt he wanted to live but he still had a good reason to live.

"I am alive."

I am alive. He repeated again, his mind not really comprehending what was going on when he felt the first wave of warm water being poured forth from the bucket in his hand. The water was warm but he didn't care since it seemed to help him relax and he let his thoughts escape from his mind. The water had an interesting effect on his body. It seemed to make his body float and he felt a sense of calmness flow through him.

He realized that he was doing exactly what he had originally planned himself
