The day had come. It had been a hundred years since I was born, and yet I had no desire to die. I had decided to take my life into my own hands and choose my own fate, and that meant that I chose to not die.

I knew it made some people uncomfortable. After all, with the discovery of how to live forever, the expectation was that you die when you felt ready to do so. But for me, I never truly felt like this was my time, so I stayed.

Now, after a hundred years on this planet, those around me were trying to convince me that it was time for me to die. They said that I had lingered too long, that I had stretched out my life far beyond what was polite. They pleaded their case, saying that I was not living a full life, that I was wasting away my years in a state of perpetual stasis.

But no matter how much they pleaded, I could not have been more sure of my decision. I had seen too much beauty and experienced too much joy to let go of my life so quickly and so easily. I knew that I could bask in this feeling of joy and peace even longer if I allowed myself to keep living. So, I firmly told them all that I was not ready to leave this world.

This response did not make them happy, but they could find no fault in my reasoning. So, I continued on in my eternal life, grateful for the gift I had been given and the extra time it had afforded me.
