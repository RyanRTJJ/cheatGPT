Lance had always been fascinated with the idea and concept of love. Despite getting his heart broken one too many times, he never stopped believing in it. Love and trust had always seemed so distant to him, like something that he could never have.

One day, Lance came across a stranger who seemed to come out of nowhere. When he looked at this man, he noticed something strange; there were no scars on him. Lance asked the stranger if he had ever been wounded, to which he replied, “No, I have never been wounded.”

This caused Lance to feel a strange sense of awe and wonder. He had grown up believing that all wounds, no matter how minor, leave permanent scars - yet here was a person untouched by any kind of pain or suffering.

Lance and the stranger talked for a while and eventually became friends. Over time, Lance realized that this person was no stranger to love, trust and kindness - he had just never been hurt before. This realization gave Lance a newfound appreciation for love and life, and allowed him to realize that there is still beauty and hope in the world even when the darkness of pain and suffering has the potential to take over.

The friend Lance made that day taught him an important lesson - that scars do not always define a person. It was a lesson that stuck with Lance for the rest of his life.
