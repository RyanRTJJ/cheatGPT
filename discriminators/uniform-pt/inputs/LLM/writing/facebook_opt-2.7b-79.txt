   -I think you need more than three words to express how you feel or you lack the word density to make your story truly great.   Edit: also - do you know your way around the English language? You should know that the word that started with a lowercase "m" sounds almost like a small "l" in front of it or a "m" before "l".
Thank you for the help!! I don’t really know where to start writing a story but I guess that’s a good start
What are you thinking of? I am sure you have tons of stories in you!
It's called the girl next door and I'm going for a kind of gritty, realistic, suspense sort of story.
That sounds good! Good luck to you! It's nice to get some feedback from reddit, i'm afraid to share my own work lest i sound like a dick!
Thank you!! It is always good to get some feedback and I'm sure you will do well! :)
Yeah that's the spirit!! Also if you're looking for a writer from Canada we can help you: /r/writerstraining or /r/writemeuppotential.  We do lots of free critiques over there too.
Thank you so much! It is true though that we do get a lot of rejections that I was just hoping for some good advice or help! I am always looking for critique partners to help out!
If you have any stories with a strong theme i'll give them a shot
Yes! Thank you I will send you some over! :) also are there any subreddits that are more geared to poetry? Maybe ones that teach stuff on how to revise your poetry?
