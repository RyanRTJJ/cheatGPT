Once upon a time in a far away land, there lived a brave young lad named Jack. He lived with his parents in a humble little cottage deep in the forest.

Jack's parents were good, hard-working people, but times were hard and money was tight. To make ends meet, Jack was sent to the village to sell their wares, but his journey was interrupted by an old hermit who appeared from out of nowhere.

The hermit told Jack that he had the gift of prophecy and offered to tell Jack the secret of his destiny. This intrigued Jack and he agreed to hear the old man's words.

The hermit said "You have been given a great quest. One that will take you far away, into dark and dangerous lands. You will face many trials and tribulations in your path and must take care to be wary of those who seek to do you harm.

At the end of your journey, you will find a great treasure. It will be yours if you have the courage and the strength to choose wisely, for you are the only one who can change your fate."

The hermit smiled and disappeared, leaving Jack alone in his thoughts. Taking the old man's advice to heart, Jack quickly prepared for his journey.

After days of difficult and treacherous travel, Jack eventually arrived at his destination. In a deep dark cave, Jack found the tremendous treasure, guarded by a horrid creature. At first the creature seemed insurmountable, but then a sly smile lit up Jack's face.

Jack used his courage and strength to defeat the beast, freeing the treasure and becoming fabulously wealthy. With his newfound wealth, Jack returned home to his parents and they all lived happily ever after.
