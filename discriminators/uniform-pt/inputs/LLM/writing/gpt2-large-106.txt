****************** I'm writing a short story with a few ideas (all ideas are open to change) about a space station with a new kind of alien. I'm imagining all kinds of alien beings (with some of those looking like humans for one, a few that look like bugs etc) with different personalities. I'm thinking that this story may go anywhere from 1,000 to 20k words (if everything goes well) and should run about 3-4 chapters long. The topic may be anything from a human story or an alien story so it can be anything you would expect from a space station story. If you have other ideas on the matter, shoot me an email and let me know. Please include: A description of the alien race or race and any other species. An idea for where the alien species, race and aliens come from if you have one. A link or description of your idea that might lead the reader to a novel you've been working on. I'm also interested in hearing about other ideas that you think might be good as well. I expect I will have enough time to reply to emails in between writing some of these short stories so don't post any longer than an hour and a half if you have something to say in an email. Thanks!
