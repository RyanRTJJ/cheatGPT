Drama
Jill had been slowly slipping away from her when they had first started going out, but Melissa could never quite put her finger on why. She tried to talk to him, but he would always get angry and it felt like she was walking on eggshells. He was so distant the last few weeks that she wasn't even sure if he still wanted to be together.

One night, Melissa was browsing through her phone and looking at old photos of them together. She remembered how he used to laugh with her, how they were so carefree, and how they could talk for hours. But now, it all seemed so distant. The more she thought about it, the angrier she got. She had had enough.

She stormed into the living room and confronted him about why he had been pulling away. There were tears and shouting, but eventually Melissa got what she was looking for. He admitted that he was in love with someone else, and it broke Melissa's heart.

She had given so much to him, and all it took was one act of betrayal to make it crumble.
