Kurt had grown up with his classmates in hero school, and he had grown tired of all their ridicule and derision as soon as he told them his power was free refills. He was smart enough to know that there was more to it than that, but he never imagined the implications of his gift would be so great.

He was studying in the school library one day when he heard a group of princesses discussing their plans for their coronation. They were discussing how they would have to hire a special team of heroes to provide them with endless refills of whatever they wanted.

Kurt realized that if he could somehow harness his "free refills" power, he could provide the princesses with a seemingly endless supply of whatever they wanted. He was so excited that he quickly ran to his dorm to get his backpack and filled it with a variety of items, such as snacks and drinks, that he thought the princesses would like.

The next day, Kurt ventured to the castle and offered to provide the princesses with a never-ending supply of their favorite things. To his surprise, they eagerly accepted his offer and asked him to join them in their coronation festivities.

Everyone was amazed at how Kurt was able to provide them with free refills of whatever they wanted. Even the people who had previously made fun of him in hero school were in awe of his newfound superpower.

Little did they know, Kurt was able to help the princesses because of his own special superpower: free refills. It was something that nobody had ever considered before, and in the end, it proved to be more powerful than anyone could have ever imagined.
