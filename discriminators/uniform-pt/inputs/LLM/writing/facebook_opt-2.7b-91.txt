 Do you:  A) Write a story about the mushroom clouds  B) Get eaten by the radioactive mushroom clouds  C) Leave the island
C, because I'm a man of survival instincts.  I'd rather be eaten by the things that'll eat me anyway.
The point of the prompt was to write a story based on your own life experiences. I'm going to assume you're not talking about you being stranded on an island, which you won't make the first sentence happen.
I'm not talking about being stranded on an island.  Because I'm a man of survival instincts.  If I had the means to get off the island, I would, immediately.  If I couldn't, I would.
I'm a man of survival instincts as well. But I'd rather survive by living than die in the process.
Which leads to the other possibility:  It's not about survival instincts:   I'm a man of survival instincts.  I'd rather live than die.  I'd rather live and spend the last few years of my life in solitude away from the world.  It's about being alone.  And about having those last few years of my life to do what my instincts tell me to do.
I'd rather be alone, yes, but my question was based on how much longer would you stay alone, and for how long. Not which is "better", but which is a possibility that you may want to consider. Survival instincts can be destructive if you stay in them too long.
I'm already thinking of dying, so I'm not considering it.  If my survival instincts take over, they'll lead me to suicide.  It's too late to stop that.  Either by taking a gunshot to the head or by driving myself and a few others off the mountain.
