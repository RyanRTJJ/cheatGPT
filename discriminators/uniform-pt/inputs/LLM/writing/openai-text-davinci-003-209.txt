John was a National Security Agency agent and had been monitoring phone calls for years, his job mostly entailed listening to people's conversations and keeping track of any suspicious dialogue. But it wasn't long before he started to recognize patterns in the conversations; couples bickering, people arguing with friends, and then two strangers' conversations whom John felt a special connection with. 

The two strangers were talking about the same random topics: their love of books, films, and art. He found it quite romantic and couldn't help but think about how perfect the two of them seemed for each other. 

John knew that it was unprofessional to start getting involved with the people he was monitoring. But, his curiosity got the better of him, so he decided he was going to be a clandestine matchmaker. 

One day, John sent the two strangers an email from a dummy account. In the email, he suggested that they meet up in person to discuss their mutual interests. 

He included the address of a local coffee shop and the time he wanted them to meet. He also included a warning not to tell anyone where they were going or why. 

The two strangers were both scared at first, unsure of what was happening. But they went to the same place on the same day and surprised to find each other. 

They had both grown so used to talking to someone anonymously over the phone, but the cleverness of the matchmaker made them chat openly and engage in meaningful conversation. 

John watched from afar as the two strangers exchanged contact information and eventually went their separate ways, all the while feeling good
