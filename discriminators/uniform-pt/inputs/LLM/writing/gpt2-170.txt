~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Eve was a bit of a bitch last year. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eve is a little bit of a dirty little fag. ~~~~~~~

Eve may have been a bit of a bit of a bitch last year. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Eve, you're a shit. I get that you'll get more into it, but I know that's not fair, right? I don't like being called a shit every now and then in this industry. All I can say is that this whole situation with the Forbidden Fruit business is the best thing I see happening before I even read a book or write a blog post. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ When I first started out, I believed in a healthy dose of cynicism and in the idea that the good things going on in life were better than the bad things and the bad things actually weren't. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~

I've just seen a very funny thing that the fakers who get paid to produce these books think there's a lot more to life than there really seems to be to life. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~

Eve has never been a big believer in the idea of taking things to the extreme. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~

He may be completely on board with things like a '90s movie that was actually supposed to be the end of people's lives, or maybe he might really still be a big fuck if you're a fan of what he does. And I don't think that all of the '90s fakes out are wrong- they certainly weren't. ~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I've always been a big proponent of using common sense and good judgment to make decisions about your own life without using words or even the word you actually know to be truthful.
