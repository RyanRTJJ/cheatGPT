Once upon a time, in a world where every human being naturally had photographic memory, there were a few special people who suffered from a debilitating genetic defect called “memory loss.”
Cathy was one of these special people. Every day was a struggle as she had to work twice as hard to remember anything. She kept notes and wrote down reminders just to help her get through the day.

Cathy quickly learned that asking for help was essential in order to function in this world. From getting her morning coffee to going to her job, she had to ask those around her for simple everyday tasks. Otherwise, she would forget it in just a few minutes.

Even though she possessed this curse, Cathy was determined to succeed in life. She studied hard, worked extra shifts and faced each day with a positive attitude. She also found a surprise blessing in her plight - she learned how to truly appreciate and cherish moments instead of letting them blur away in her forgetful mind.

Being the strong and determined person she was, Cathy eventually graduated university with a degree in medical research. She specialized in memory and discovered that although everyone had photographic memory, there were those like her who were missing parts of the gene that coded for it.

Thanks to her research, Cathy was finally able to find a cure for herself and those who suffered like her. Although they would not have photographic memory, they'd have a much better quality of life.

As Cathy looked around her, she was filled with so much happiness and pride on all the good that she had done. Despite having the curse of memory loss, Cathy had managed to overcome it and help countless other people in the process. She was a true inspiration to all those around her.
