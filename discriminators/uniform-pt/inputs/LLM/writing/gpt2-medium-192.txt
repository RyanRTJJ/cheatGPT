 Some are learned through failure, and some are learned by experience. Some fail to recognize their mistakes when they occur, and sometimes it takes a lifetime to learn to avoid one of them.  In the case of this message, I learned a few things, but also a great many others.

If you want to understand just how deeply deeply flawed you are, or how deeply flawed a single person is, go and read this:  How Did I Get Here? by Steve Jobs.  Yes, to read that story is not to waste your time. It is not for me to fill the vacuum of my own mind and thoughts with any less pain than I would from a life lesson, and it certainly is not for me to force you to read through a book if you have never read before, and you don't want to.  But I want you to read it, and to share it with others that you think might be similarly affected.  Please keep in mind, while all the world's problems are caused by human beings in your life, I am just one of those people.  It's important
