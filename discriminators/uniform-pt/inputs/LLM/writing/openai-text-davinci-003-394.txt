It started with an incredible sense of curiosity. Suddenly I was wondering why I was so drawn to sniffing around the neighborhood and why the sight of a large green backyard brought me such joy. It made absolutely no sense to me, but it felt incredibly natural.

I began to recognize similarities between myself and the other animals in my world. Things that stood out were my heightened senses of smell and hearing - both of which were far more acute than any humans around me. My body also seemed to move differently than others - I didn't walk upright like the people around me, but instead ran around on all fours.

All this led me to do some further research and, in time, I found out that I was adopted some years back. I had been adopted by a loving family, and I was grateful for their kindness and care, but I had never known what exactly my story was. Now, however, I had a clearer picture - I was a dog.

I was a bit overwhelmed by this discovery, and the knowledge that I was different from the humans around me. But despite this, I embraced my identity and found a way to thrive in my new life. I slowly adapted to being a dog and began to thoroughly enjoy the life I was living.

Though it was unexpected, I ended up loving life as a pup and was grateful to have been adopted by a family who accepted and loved me as I am.
