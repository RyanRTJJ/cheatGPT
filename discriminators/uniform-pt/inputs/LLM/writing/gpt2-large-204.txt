_______________________________ CHAPTER 2 - The Dark Tower The Dark Tower ___________ This is one of my older story ideas. It has been around for a little more than a year now and I have started to write it out. I really don't have a strong vision for this one, other than to do well. My hope is to try some new things with this one, and make it great. I have had some ideas about taking things a bit further, and adding some more things. There will be an outline and structure as the story progresses and it's really not that important to me - I simply like the idea that this is a story that does not end. (But yes, I hope this turns out to be something interesting.) The ending will also not be the only outcome. (I do not want to reveal the ending here, but I will be writing about it). I can't wait to write the story - with your help! I have many stories in my head, but it's hard to get a hold on them all, so please consider helping me out with this one. The world itself is my most favorite fictional world, but I have no real clue how to make it into a place with a plot or a style that works for you. Hopefully this is one of those stories where I've gotten something good to work with - hopefully you will be able to help make it all work. I'm still in the middle of thinking it through myself, and I hope you guys will be able to do the same. I love writing stories and want to continue adding to them for this story. Thanks a bunch for thinking of me. ^_^ _______________________________ CHAPTER 3 - Two for One The Dark Tower ___________ My name is Eric Kripke.
