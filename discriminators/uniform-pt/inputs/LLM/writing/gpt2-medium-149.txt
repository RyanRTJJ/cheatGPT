 You will find yourself in a small town, where men and women are at war, one of them is a preacher and he has a message to deliver to you.  You read your message for what it is, only to go back in time and create a new version of the book.  You return to this small town and meet the preacher again.  You have already received a message from God himself with a message from God for everyone in the world not afraid to embrace the same message.  Now, you go back in time to save humankind.  From all the wars, all the evil that a government or a religion can inflict in the name of God, you create a perfect world so that everyone can be happy and prosperous and safe.

What you create then is the perfect world that Jesus said he was trying to recreate.  Instead, you create a world where we are all fighting one side against the other, with all that can be done to destroy one another.  Now that you are setting the stage for your adventure, you can move on to the book.   You can read the book for what it is and return to your home town and see your beautiful wife, children and husband. You don't have to rewrite the Quran to read how this could all have been avoided - what it comes down to is reading just one verse, read it and see if you can get that same message across to the masses at this time.  Or, if you want to do nothing, read about how God made it up and that this is part of the greatest religion around, see if you can read the scriptures, the Bible, etc.
After you read each letter of the Bible and Quran - you write your own story about this.  You go back in time to save mankind.  This
