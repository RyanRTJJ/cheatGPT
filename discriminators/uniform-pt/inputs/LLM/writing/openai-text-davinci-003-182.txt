Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there lived a unique and mysterious tribe of people where laughter and tears reversed depending on the situation.

When sadness befell a person, they would break out into peals of laughter and if they experienced joy, they would cry tears of joy. For years, the people of this tribe would observe this custom when facing the joys and sorrows of life.

Many wondered at the peculiarity of this tribe, especially travelers who passed through the area. They often sought out members of the tribe in the hopes of learning the secret of their mysterious custom, though the answers they found were typically simple.

The people of the tribe had learned the hard way that life is too precious to be spent in sadness. Focusing on the good and learning to see the positives in all things had become natural to them. They felt that by reversing their typical emotions, it gave them a newfound appreciation for even the smallest blessings that came their way.

This unique custom eventually spread and soon people of every culture could be seen embracing the power of laughter in the face of adversity and weeping with joy during good times. And in doing so, their lives filled with more light, more warmth, and more understanding than ever before.

The tribe was educated, happy and prosperous now. No matter the situation, they still followed their custom and laughed for joy and cried for sadness. People came together to support one another, knowing what mattered most in the end, was how we laughed and how we cried.
