The mission was a difficult one - take the life of Ash Ketchum and his beloved Pikachu. It was a job that only a skilled assassin like me could take on. I had already been hired by the European Union to take out the powerful trainer, and as one of the best in the world, I was confident that I could do it.

My plan began with gathering intel on Ash and his Pikachu. It took me a while but I eventually managed to get a pretty decent picture of their daily routine. It became obvious that my best chance of finding the pokemon trainer and taking him out was to do it while he was on the go.

My plan was simple - I would follow Ash and Pikachu around town and then when the moment presented itself, I would strike. I knew that I had to hit them quickly and without warning or else I would put myself in serious danger.

My plan seemed to work well, as I managed to tail Ash before eventually going in for the kill. As soon as I moved in, I shot down Ash and Pikachu, who were both taken by surprise and unable to do anything about it. I knew that I had succeeded in my mission and quickly made my escape from the scene.

This mission was one that I won't soon forget, as it was the assignment that made my reputation what it is today - a ruthless assassin who gets the job done, no matter the price. I know that I did the European Union proud, and that my work will be remembered for years to come.
