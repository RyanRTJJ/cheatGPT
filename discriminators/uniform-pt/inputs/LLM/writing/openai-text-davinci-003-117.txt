It was the year 2120. Humanity had finally cracked the formula for interstellar travel and prepared to colonize new planets.

In the beginning, all went surprisingly smoothly. The new human colonies flourished on the new planets, providing great prosperity to all involved.

Little did humanity realize that they had unleashed forces far beyond their reckoning. As the human settlements spread, they began to slowly devastate the planets they were occupying.

Soon the native species of the newly colonized realms began to suffer, and the planet's eco-systems started to fail. Humanity was slowly turning into monsters as they greedily took whatever they could find and destroyed whatever they could not take.

As the situation spiraled out of control, the native species began to organize and fight back. But it was too late - the harm done by humanity was done, and the planets they were once inhabiting were now little more than spectral husks.

It was only then that humanity realized it was themselves that had become the monsters. And it was too late to do anything about it.
