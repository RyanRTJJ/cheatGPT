Here are the main guidelines:

• Your description should focus on its most basic elements, not on the details that don't seem necessary for your story to work.

• If possible, include three characters, even one—use a two-person, one-event story.

• If you have multiple objects involved, or if you need to create additional events and characters to make it interesting, make sure this prompt is flexible enough to account for all of those details.

For instance, if you need to include an object in your story, it should be something large: a chair, a table, a sofa, or at least a large rock. Or if you need to create an entire new event, it should not be something small: a fire, an earthquake, or so on. This prompt makes room for more details that you may have to deal with later in the story, which is good since it means you don't have to do them all at once. Instead, you can choose when to include them. Your description should also include an attempt to identify which elements of the object affect the event, including the setting, how the event takes place, and who is affected.

If you have to use a specific object as your object, it should be a simple one, not, for instance, a large, complicated object, or an object with many different uses (such as a desk, a bed, a door, or an umbrella).

Here's a sample prompt:

In the story, a student is asked to write a thank-you note to a parent who lost a son. 
If your story involves objects you need to use in the writing:
• In your description, identify exactly which objects you might need for your story.

• Show which objects you can easily create or find.

• Use descriptive words, but do not exaggerate.

• Show the objects in both realistic and fictional settings.

• Show how the objects affect the scene you describe.

Example Prompt: I saw the sky through the floor and ceiling:
"I saw the sky through the floor and ceiling."
