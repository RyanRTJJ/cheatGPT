__________ Why write a story? If you can be lazy or work hard, and get paid less, then why not? What are you waiting for? Write it! __________ Where do I start? Please use my story as a template and fill in where necessary. It's not a template in the literal sense, but it can make the job of writing a good story easier. Please feel free to put in your own ideas or anything that appeals to you. Just remember that the goal is to create meaningful, enjoyable and memorable writing. If you don't like anything in this story, please don't use it and send me the story. I'd love to read it. Are you good at this? I'd love to have your creative assistance as long as I can, but if you don't feel like helping because you're busy or need another creative outlet, then don't bother. The more people that contribute in my book, the better. How will I know if you're a good writer? I'll do a story and email it back to you. If you're a good writer, I'll contact you! What if you don't like a story? Well, sorry, I haven't told you how to deal with that. (This isn't about you, it's about me!) How much do writers get paid? They don't make as much as you'd think for their number of words. Most of the time, the writers actually get paid less for their work and a lot of the time the money they get is being made on the back end of my work. I'll say it again, I get paid just for writing. So how much do you get paid to write? A lot! A lot more than you would think. That depends on what genre fiction you write (poetry, short fiction and novels, for example) but there is enough to go around. Don't ask me how much you get paid for doing poetry, I don't know! But I can tell you this... you know
