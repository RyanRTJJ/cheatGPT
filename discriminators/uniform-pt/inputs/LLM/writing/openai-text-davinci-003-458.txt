Samantha had been raised to be open-minded and tolerant of different ways of thinking, never judging people by their beliefs. However, as she grew into an adult and observed the world around her, she began to see how divided humanity had become. She had watched as her friends chose sides, and she had not. She had remained on the sidelines, observing and listening but never inciting.

But now it was time. Time to choose a side.

She had read, discussed and debated up and down the spectrum of thought, never definitively picking one. But this time it seemed different. This time it felt like the stakes were much higher and that the wrong decision could have lasting, devastating consequences.

But Samantha had made up her mind. She had chosen a side. No matter what the outcome, she was firmly rooted in her position. She was ready to take up arms, ready to go to war, ready to fight alongside her friends and comrades.

She wasnâ€™t naive; she knew that she might be proven wrong, and that she may one day look back and regret her decision. But she was ready to deal with whatever came her way, confident that her choice had been made for the right reasons.

And so it was decided. Samantha was on her side, whatever came their way.
