_________________________/ Your eyes meet and your body reacts. You are the owner and you want that eyes to be yours alone. _________________________/ You don't want to let your own eyes sit there, do you? They're probably the first ones to get used to the sight of a strange man they can't even figure out the name of, let alone the situation they found themselves in. It's only natural that they'd feel slightly uncomfortable standing next to a man their own size. _________________________/ Your eyes start making curious eye contact, but you ignore it. _________________________/ Noticing that you're still on your bed, it's not that big a story, but you do care, even if it's not something you'd give much thought to anyway. _________________________/ The door slides open, leading into your bedroom. _________________________/ Your bed's soft cotton covers are pulled over you. Your arms are held back from your body and a soft warmth envelops you as you feel a warm tongue touch the tip of your cock, gently stroking it gently and slowly from tip to base. _________________________/ You look down and see that the sheets aren't that firm at all. Instead, you notice the sheets have been draped across your head, leaving a soft outline on your bare chest and stomach.Â  As you start to reach up to adjust the sheets, you notice that they have a subtle outline on your hips. _________________________/ You feel the tip of your cock start throbbing. You are not used to so much as making the slightest noise, and you've been in a world much smaller than yours so far. It's odd for you. You are, however, perfectly comfortable with the thought of making a noise - how comfortable, you don't know. You don't care, not even in the slightest in the least. You don't care if it's making it so much harder to focus on anything in front of you. _________________________/ You feel your hand slip to the back of your panties. You try not to notice the bulge in your panties as you try to adjust your nightdress. It's so small now. It's so, so
