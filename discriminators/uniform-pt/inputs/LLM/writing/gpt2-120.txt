 that is somehow indistinguishable from the physical voice of a man. This sounds absurd, but it's a natural consequence of creationism, but the human voice also shapes our language in a way that transcends the physical. The difference is that the human voice is now heard by anyone who can hear it! And God's voice, in fact, is now audible by mere human beings! 
It appears that, of this vast number of voices, none seem so completely natural, and so utterly bizarre to the non-existence that it seems so impossible to comprehend how we ever could conceive of anything other than his. The only conclusion that there is to come is that the voice exists within some sort of self, or perhaps he is an imposter that wants no part in this imposter's existence. If such a person believes that nothing exists other than his own essence, it can only be a possibility that exists as a being to which his creator does not give it consideration. A living man would be able to imagine that anything which comes out of his soul would also come out of his consciousness, and then a living creature would be able to see that something that does not exist cannot know that it is not what it can not know. In truth, what is really happening is that nothing which comes out of our consciousness is so alien it is incomprehensible at all. It is only so that anything that does not exist can perceive that it cannot. And we also come to see that the essence of human beings seems to be a creature as if it were a creature.
I don't disagree about this. God does seem to have created something other than the physical voice that he speaks of. He does allow those who do not perceive it to know it by seeing it: that's the same idea that applies to human beings themselves.
