Susan had spent a lifetime guarded and reticent. She often felt that she was an open book, with all her thoughts, emotions and insecurities, written out in clear lettering across her forehead. So, when she found the courage to speak her truth and tell Mike how she had always felt she was both surprised and relieved.

Mike had been a part of her life for many years, starting back in grade school. They had grown into adulthood together, but never truly connected on a romantic level. Mike had found his own path in life, marrying another woman and settling down.

As life events took the two down separate roads, Susan had held onto her feelings, and while condolences were often sent in response to a difficult situation that Mike was going through Susan could never utter what she truly felt - until now.

"For what it's worth," she said, her voice trembling slightly and her eyes glistening with emotion, "I've always loved you."

Mike, who had been largely oblivious to Susan's true feelings for him, was taken aback by her confession. He looked into her eyes, in that moment of intimacy, each of them understanding the magnitude of her confession.

Time seemed to stand still and the two of them were both lifted up, until that moment when Mike was finally able to breathe. "I love you too, Susan."

And with those three words, their story that had been so long in the making, felt complete.
