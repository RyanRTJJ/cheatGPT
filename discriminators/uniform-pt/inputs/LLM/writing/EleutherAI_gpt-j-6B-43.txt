If someone finds you guilty of a crime, even if you were innocent, it will not affect your life much.

But you can affect someone's life in two ways if you write to this page to tell me you have been found not guilty of a crime which you did commit.

If you were found guilty of a crime, your punishment will be much worse than it would have been if you had been found innocent.

Please answer the questions:
What crime did you commit that you were found "Not Guilty"?
Who is this web page "belongs" To?
How have you seen your life change because of this web page?
If you had been found innocent of this crime, how would life have been different?
Who is the person you write to most easily identify with as the "writer"?
What is the most important thing the person can do to help you?

This web page is called The Lost Pages and is open to the public. The web page is not intended specifically for writers, but any author with a criminal past, whether or not he has been found "Not Guilty, could take a leaf out of the book and write a book about this topic, and how he/she has changed as a result of it. I want to hear from other writers that this is a good idea.

I would welcome any comments.

The author would like you to read this post on crime blogging. It will give you some ideas for your web page.

I will not be posting to this page, on purpose, for about a month, as I am doing a book review of the book called: The Man Who Could Work Miracles" by G.F. Russell. ( A.H. Weiler review on Amazon).

But, that does not mean that I will not post to this web page frequently, as a rule.

If you are not interested in reading about writing, or you are interested in writing, but you are not interested in crime and /or writing, then you can stop writing to this page.
