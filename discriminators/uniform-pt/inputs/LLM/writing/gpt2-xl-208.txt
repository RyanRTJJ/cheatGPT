 The time has come; the time has come for you to die.  You are to place yourself in a state of hibernation when you were not under the influence of any form of mind altering drugs.  You must not go to sleep under any circumstances.  Sleep is your enemy, death is your greatest foe.  And when you go to sleep, you must not dream of the dead.  If you do, then you will return to life the next day under the same circumstances.  And if you do not dream, you still will return to...well...death.  In the case that you would die from boredom, your death was quick-wittedly planned when you were asleep.  You are a great man, a great poet, a great artist, a great manly man.  You had plenty of opportunities to die in your youth, but did not.  You were made, not born.  Your story is a good one; there is little question.  But there are many others, and there will be many others.  There will have to be.  Death is as inevitable as the sunrise.  Life is only that much harder.  Even as you write this, you know it is already too late.  The night sky shines clear upon the dying sunlight.  You do not need eyes; you have ears and that is all.  There is not a shadow in the sky.  You are not there. You die easily.  
This story started as a response to The Muffled Cries Of The Dead. If you've listened to that story (which you absolutely should, it's brilliant), you'll know what I'm talking about.  This is an entirely my own creation, I am a terrible author and my stories aren't very good.  This also doesn't have a title for a couple of reasons, one I want to go by and let this be it, and two I want to keep it under the radar.  But as far as "the other", I will share it with you.  
It starts with you as you
