 Don't worry about "future" and "past" changing, just use the second-person narrator.  "Hey, Taylor, I hear you could use extra help around the house lately.  Here, I have a few ideas for you."  Then read the story and see how you'd change it. [ SCIFFY ] Write a story which is entirely in first-person.  Don't worry about first-person and pluralizing "I"... just use the first-person narrator.  "I'm sitting on my dad's desk, thinking about the future, thinking about my friends."  Then read the story and tell me what you think.  Then... [ SCIFFY2 ] Write a story which is entirely in first-person.  Have fun!  Use "I'm sitting on my dad's desk" to fill a paragraph then change to "I'm sitting on your dad's desk" and "my dad's desk" and see how you'd change it. The rest of them are just suggestions and could be whatever.  Use them as you feel appropriate.  You can mix-and-match sentences and paragraphs up until you feel you've got something which you feel would work. If you end up using them or something else you think is awesome, please do tell me, so I can share it and maybe even link to your blog for the readers to discover!  Or, feel free to not post it and I'll come up with something better. Have a wonderful writing week everyone! Cheers,
