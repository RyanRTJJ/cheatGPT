 Also, I will have people PM me their stories.  I haven't had any in a while though...
Please explain if you do and I'll upvote.
/u/A_Random_Creeper did indeed.
Thanks. It was very good.
I know. I was cracking up at the very end as he was waiting for the bus haha.   Thanks for posting it, /u/randytru
Ha, I totally didn't see it coming!   There's a lot more to his story. If you'd like, I can share it on here for all to enjoy.
Sure. I just saw it in the new section and wanted to post immediately haha. Is everything okay?
I have the flu. And my brain isn't at full function. I'll post tonight hopefully.
That's a pretty big deal. I hope you feel better soon.
Thanks you. I hope you have a great day!!
How was work today?
It was okay. I just started a new medication for depression, so it may have affected me. I'm hoping I'm doing better soon.
Can you tell me what it is? I'm pretty serious about my depression.
It's called Cymbalta. I'm in the trial program now, so it will just cost me $15 per month. You'll have to pay first month's up front, and insurance will reimburse you. I don't have any experience with meds like that, so I won't be able to tell you much.
I'll definitely keep it in mind. Can you give me any other good advice?
I know that for myself, keeping my mood high has been hard. It isn't the medication, because I've been this way for awhile. I'm trying to find things I like to do, so I don't feel the emptiness. But right now the thing I hate is cooking. I don't even want to cook. The thought of washing a pan to do a meal is too much for me, so I eat fast food or go out to eat.
