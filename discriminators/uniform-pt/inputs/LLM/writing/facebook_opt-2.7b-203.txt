 I'd like to read the result once you're done.
That is a cool premise! Thanks for thinking of it :) I'll see what I can do!
Aww awesome, i think most people would like to read this story. As long as you take your time.
I definitely will, as soon as I can :) thank you for helping get me brainstorming! I never actually thought about this kind of thing before so it's really inspired me to think about it!
Thanks, and just so you know i read the first part of your story :) but i think you should use more active words instead of passive ones ;)
Thank you for your very constructive criticism!! I think I'll try to add some better verbs or something in a later part of the story :)
No problem! You made the whole thing sound super interesting :) i hope you can keep us interested with the story while you work your way through this :)
It was definitely my intention :) the feedback has inspired me to work on it some more so thank you for it!
No no no thanks for reading my stuff, if you ever need feedback just let me know and ill do anything i can for you.
No problem, and I will! You have been a very nice person to listen to me talk for a while, thank you! :)
I hope you can work through this story :DDD
Yes! That is my goal! I think I have a pretty good idea of what I'm aiming for so hopefully it will work out! :) it will probably take quite a while but I'm excited for it.
Sounds very exciting! Good luck writing it!! :D (i guess you dont need my help anymore with this though)
Nope :) If it helps at all, I'm actually really excited to write and publish it too!! I have a lot of creative ideas for the plot and backstory that, sadly, you won't be able to see. I am very excited to share these with the world!!
