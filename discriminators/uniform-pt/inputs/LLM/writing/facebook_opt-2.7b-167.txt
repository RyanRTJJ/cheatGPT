 Your title: A very important lesson for children who go to school  Your body: There's a little boy who goes to school  His name is Harry and they say he's really talented behind the wheel  He's never been in an accident before, but you never know  His parents say he's a great student, but that's not easy
This is going to go great with a book of some sort.

Yeah, but a four year old who's done nothing wrong deserves a fucking sand box.
That's not what I mean. I'll
