  Remember, there is no one that can save you but yourself. And a strong, well armed man can be a dangerous enemy. And even if the man is strong and well armed, he can still be overcome by the right weapon. You are well armed. But this can still be over-come if you are not vigilant about what dangers you are facing. Be aware. If you think that you are going to survive, you are likely wrong. Only you are able to save your life. Think about how you can save yourself. Remember, all you will be leaving behind is a blood smear on the street.

Note: I don't want this story to turn into anything like "Rune Runner: A Zombie Story" or "Zombies and Unicorns". I am looking for something like "A Day Like No Other" or "Crimson Storm". If my story is considered as not matching the genre of this competition, I ask the mods to delete it.

A:

This would be a pretty cool story for "A Day Like No Other" (with some minor changes for the contest)

Once upon a time there was a girl who wanted to go to school. She would never give up. So she decided to steal the class notes and give them to her friend who was being punished after getting caught smoking. After that there was trouble; people trying to take her friend away, police taking her name for something, etc. 
And now the man that was keeping her friend is chasing her, while she was running away

On top of being an awesome story I'd like to add an extra part:

Don't give up, think of a way to save yourself. There are always two:
A: Get captured
B: Hide in a safe place (a building, a room, an old car or a secret underground base)

A: 

You're on a plane, in a sea-side resort, it's the end of the year, people on the island are getting drunk, you're pretty wasted
