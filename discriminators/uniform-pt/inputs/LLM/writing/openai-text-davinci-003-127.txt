I looked up at my owner, who had been my best friend and family for the last fifteen years of my life. I had a feeling that something was wrong, but I wasn't sure what it was. She had been staying up late crying, and I could smell the pain coming off of her. My heart nearly broke every time I heard her sniffling in the night. I wanted so badly to comfort her and make sure she was okay, but I just didn't know how.

The next few days went by in a blur. My owner took me all around our neighborhood, visiting even the places we never normally went. She took me to our favorite park and let me run around in the grass. She took me to the river’s edge and let me take a dip. It was like she was saying all the goodbyes she couldn't say with words. 

The next day, my owner took me to the vet, and I knew this was it. I was full of a mixture of sadness and acceptance, mixed in with a few excited barks as I got to visit a place I'd only heard of from other dogs. The vet was kind and gentle, and I knew they wouldn't hurt me. The vet gave me a shot and suddenly everything felt very slow and fuzzy. I felt myself drifting away and I could feel my owner crying over me. 

The last thing I heard before I completely blacked out was my owner's voice whispering in my ear, “I love you, my dear boy. I know you’ll always be with me in spirit. Goodbye, my best friend. Rest easy now.”
