 This new kid will, if exposed to an environment that is so unpleasant, become a psychopath. That's because when a child is exposed to things, like bullying, threats, and the internet, psychopaths tend to react by trying to take things the "normal" way.  That makes people act more impulsively.  And if their behavior causes other human beings a great deal of sadness, that doesn't mean they were the ones who were trying to kill you when you were little.
After all, in a few short years, those kids will be back to seeing the face and being raised by the people who will become those responsible for your downfall. Why, the rest of this story is about teenagers who are traumatized by their own loss.  Don't waste a minute getting up at 5 o'clock.
In the future, you shouldn't underestimate how difficult it is to become a psychopath at the best of times.  Even for those teenagers who are just getting started, if you can stand to become a psychopath, that's a start.  You can make changes in your life and in your life's ways, but you will have to make certain you live your life as a "normal child." This is what you need today. This is all you need in order to be a decent, good, healthy individual.
