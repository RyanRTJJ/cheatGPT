The inhabitants of the vast ocean depths had seen nothing like it. A big, metallic beast with silver scales that glinted in the faint sea light sped by like a rabbit in a field of carrots. Its occupants peered out cautiously.

The citizens of the long-dormant civilizations had only ever heard rumors of life outside the confines of their own depths. To see such a thing was an amazing marvel. They were both intrigued and scared by this strange new visitor to their realm.

Their curiosity stoked, the elders of the civilization decided it was time to explore the world above. They gathered their best divers and built a great submarine, deploying it forth from their ocean trench base.

As the great sub ascended, the crew observed an alien world of green and blue from their tiny portholes. When the sub reached the surface, the crew were greeted by the sky and its never ending array of stars.

They bobbed at the surface and waited to see what the surface people would do. Sure enough, they were spotted. After some cautious exchanges, the surface folks welcomed their visitors, curious to learn more of the mysterious civilization below.

The deep-dwellers returned to the depths with tales of the wonders up above. Some chose to stay up above while others who had made the journey continued to explore the depths where they started. The ocean trench had opened itself up to a new and adventurous world.
