 It's a little old, but is my favorite piece of writing that I've ever done.
I have lots of posts and ideas for prompts right this very moment, so if you have any you'd like to get in on, go ahead and submit them. Happy writing!
I've been working on this for a while and thought I'd share it with you.  I used some of the ideas and scenes from the  " The Art of Story Building "  tutorial that I've been doing with my workshop participants and found some  new inspiration for the topic as well!  You can find it over on  The Art of Story Building.
My goal for this prompt was to create  a scene from the perspective of a character that was in or about to be involved with serious injury.  (It doesn't have to be a personal experience, so don't be shy about drawing other people in this way.) Here's how the scene works: I'll list a bunch of the scenes I like best for this type of scene and give some examples of what a "scene" like this might be like. In this scene, a character who has been in a serious car crash wakes up after surviving, is questioned by the authorities about how things went and how long they were out, and is then sent to a more or less psychiatric hospital.
The scene could go on for as long or short as you like.  The character might be in a coma for weeks.  When they come out, they realize they're not the same person they were before it all happened.  However, they're able to see and feel things, see the damage caused, learn more about the accident, and make changes (and, in some cases, lose control). I tried to make a scene that was as emotionally engaging for those who read it.  I wanted to avoid, for the most part, letting the plot dictate the character's emotion. (Just saying that, as it turns out, I wasn't so lucky in this one.)
