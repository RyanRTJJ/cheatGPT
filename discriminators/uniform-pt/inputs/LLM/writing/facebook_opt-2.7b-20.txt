 What steps would you have in such a case?
He would need to either be killed by them to escape the empire, or join and be a second soldier.
Or he would need to kill one and become the one.
That's a hard one.
I agree. A person only needs one to survive. I see it as one or the other. I think killing the leader is a bit too extreme. If I was the last one, I would want to escape. I'd be willing to take a short life imprisonment. I think that the man you think is the leader might be the last survivor among many other men. There'd just be another leader waiting in the wings to take the place of the current leader.
I think the "one" would be the leader as well. In the world that exists, he will always be the last man.
I don't know... if you were the last one, how did you die? Did you just keel over? I guess you could say that it's not certain, but the odds are against you.
If you weren't a general he couldn't possibly have been the last one. He is a general in the empire. We can't just assume if he was the only general left, he is the last one. He could have died in battle while a general.
I hadn't really considered that. I can see that. I guess it depends on how far along the war was. Could they be at the height of their campaign, or was it a stalemate?
I think we have to assume the war was over as they are surrounded by huge armies.
Hmm, now that you say that, yes. I agree. This is the most likely scenario. Thank you, I had completely forgot about that.
I'm glad this helped!
