John had a passion for space exploration like no other – ever since he was a child, he wanted to send something into the great unknown of the stars above. Now, he was finally in the position to do just that. With the help of his engineering team, he had created a one-of-a-kind prototype rocket and attached a camera to it to photograph whatever it encountered on its journey into space.

Finally, the time for launching the rocket came, and with a loud roar, it shot its way into space. After its journey, it was time for the film to be developed with the photos that the camera had taken. To John’s surprise and amazement, the pictures revealed a flat Earth.

John had always suspected that the Flat Earth theory was true – he had been researching it for years – and this was the conclusive piece of evidence he needed to prove it. The photographs caused a huge stir in the scientific community, with scientists from all over the world debating the implications of this discovery.

John was given recognition for his pioneering work in the field of space exploration, and finally, the mystery of the flat Earth was not a mystery anymore.
