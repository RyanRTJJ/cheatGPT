Mina was an atheist, but in death she found herself in a strange chapel with unfamiliar symbols and people who were praying foreign words. She felt oddly out of place, wondering where she was and what happened to her after she had died.

Suddenly, a gentle voice spoke in her mind. It was God, in the form of a powerful spiritual presence, speaking directly to her soul. He told her that upon her death, she had gone to the afterlife of the religion she had followed most closely throughout her life, known or not.

Mina was flabbergasted. Despite believing in no higher power during life, she had unknowingly followed the principles and ethical aspects of various religions. Now, she was reaping the rewards in the afterlife.

Although she was a different person in the afterlife, she found some solace in knowing that even though she was an atheist in life, she was still able to benefit from the principles and beliefs of religion. In death, she was finally able to find spiritual enlightenment and happiness.
