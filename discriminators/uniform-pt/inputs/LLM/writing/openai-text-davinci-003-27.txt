Paul had been with Google Street View for a few weeks now, and he was getting use to it. His job was straightforward, drive through designated areas while the car captured images for Google Street View. He was feeling kind of bored one day, so he decided to take a different route, one he didn't recognize.

Right away, strange things started happening around him. First, he saw a giant rabbit hopping along the sidewalk. He shook his head and shrugged it off. A moment later, he noticed a woman in a long white dress walking through a muddy puddle without the slightest bit of mud even splashing against her dress. What was going on?

Paul glanced around for any cameras or pranksters, but he didn't find anyone. As he drove, he continued to be amazed as he witnessed a storefront float upwards for a few feet and then float back down, a man in a top hat balancing a bowling pin on his chin, and a toddler running along a line of parked cars and jumping from one car to the next.

As Paul drove through the strange area, he kept expecting to catch pranksters to come forward and put an end to the mystery. But the weirdness continued and he eventually concluded that it must have been some strange pocket of reality that he had stumbled into.

When he finally finished his route, he drove out of the area, shaken and yet strangely exhilarated. He had only seen a fraction of what the area had to offer, but he had witnessed enough to know that there was something strange happening within it. He vowed to tell no one of what he had experienced, as it was something that he would likely never again enter.
