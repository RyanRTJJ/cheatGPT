Once upon a time there was a small baby, who looked like many other babies - they were identical. But this baby was different. Unbeknownst to his parents, his personality was quite extraordinary. 

He was kind and generous, and was always thinking of others rather than himself. He had a very positive outlook on life and his energy was contagious, so the people around him were happier and more content than they had ever been before. 

As the baby grew up, he carried on with his impressive behavior. But something else was happening too. His physical appearance was changing. He was becoming a younger, more attractive version of himself, with every kind and thoughtful action that he undertook. His parents, friends and strangers alike remarked on this transformation as he grew up, and found it to be quite magical.

Meanwhile, some of the less generous people in the baby's life also changed, but in the opposite direction. As they acted selfishly and behaved negatively, their physical appearances became dull and unattractive.

It was clear that in this world, your physical appearance was tightly linked to your personality. The baby's parents found it incredible, but they were just grateful that they had a beautiful son who others admired because of his kind nature, rather than the way he looked more conventionally. 

The baby's journey taught everyone a valuable lesson - that beauty comes from within and it is your personality, not your physical features, that determine who you are.
