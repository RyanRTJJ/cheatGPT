 That should give some nice exercise.
Oh dear God...   This isn't something I am good at at all. My thoughts go all over the place on that and would definitely get me in a lot or trouble lol
No doubt.  Try it, but don't even call it a story if it turns out to be anything but "nothing" because the story gets disqualified and no one gets anything.  We all have to earn what we get.  You get whatever it is you write.
Well, I'm up for trying this!
See you in an hour.
How should I write this?
I actually have zero experience in coming up with things to say when you have to lie but whatever.  Just make sure you never lie about anything important.  Keep it light and in good taste.
Can I lie about what you said?  Or are you expecting something similar to the prompt?   Like, you'd want me to write the last thing you said before you died - what you were thinking/planning - what your favorite color looks like - how to get away with breaking a lease/taking out a loan/stealing etc. etc. etc.
I would say absolutely not.  I want to know all those things at least a day after you die, though.  Like all important plans, all important dreams, all important desires.  None of the less, though, if you want I'll read your notes.  They won't be perfect, but they'll be better than nothing.
Well, if I can't think of anything else that sounds good I'll at least post something that sounds like I'm talking to a friend, as if talking to a friend about these things would make them a part of my actual life.
Oh yeah, definitely do that.  This isn't a contest or a contest of lies, it's a way for me to explore the relationship between "lies" and "truth".
