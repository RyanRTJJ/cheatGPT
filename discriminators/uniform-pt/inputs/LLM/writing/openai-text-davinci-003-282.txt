Jane had been dreaming strange dreams all her life. She felt like she'd known the same man every night in her sleep for as long as she could remember. But she had no idea who he was, or why she kept seeing him in her dreams. 

One day she saw the same strange man in a coffee shop. He had a certain familiarity about him, and when he looked up at her his eyes brightened in recognition. She suddenly felt like she could remember what it was like to dream with him, and she felt complete when their eyes met.

Without a word, they both understood what was happening. They had an unspoken connection that could only exist in their shared dream world.

The man built a world they visited together each night. It was a place of beauty and peace. Together they explored all the secrets the land held, and whenever Jane thought she had seen it all, the man would reveal something new. They felt like a family, and over time their connection grew deeper and more meaningful. 

Thinking of the beautiful world they shared together, Jane said to the man in the coffee shop "We really do have something special. If it weren't for this persistent lucid dreaming, we would have never crossed paths".

The man smiled and nodded in agreement. They both knew they'd been connected all along, and it was only Jane's ability of persistent lucid dreaming that had allowed them to reunite and build their dream world together.
