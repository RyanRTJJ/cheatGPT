~~~~~~~~~~~ TALK TO PEOPLE! ~~~~~~~~~~~ When you're in a dark room, try telling the same story that everyone you meet has heard; the same story that your friends tell you, and even, in an act of heroism, tell you yourself. (I bet you're getting nervous now.) If you find yourself making the same story over and over again, you're probably asking: Why do people always need me? ~~~~~~~~~~~ CITIZEN! ~~~~~~~~~~~ Everyone should have a chance to make their own decisions. That isn't to say that you have to be an expert on all things important, or that no one should have the upper hand over you. But let's face it, not everyone in society is going to have the same set of desires and needs. When you're out on a date, just tell the girl you're with that if she wants to, you can tell her not to go through with the night. You don't know what to say, but if you can do that with people, you should feel free to do it with others. But be ready for people to tell you what to say. ~~~~~~~~~~~ LOVING A WOMAN ~~~~~~~~~~~ It's fine to say and do things that are not nice. It's part of the game of love. But sometimes, even if it's just a passing moment, or the way a person smiles, people are the reason you're in love with them. When you're being with someone, look every bit as deep as you can in to them. Think of them as your sisters and brothers. Be willing to overlook their faults and make them better. ~~~~~~~~~~~ GET TALENT ~~~~~~~~~~~ You may have heard the expression, "to catch a fish with a net." This is true about everything you do and who you are. However, if you want to be with someone, that's only half the battle. Be sincere and genuine. It is in the power of your heart to be in harmony with your desires and needs. ~~~~~~~~~~~ BE FOCUSED ON YOUR BEST
