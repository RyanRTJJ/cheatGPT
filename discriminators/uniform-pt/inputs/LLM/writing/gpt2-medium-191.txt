 You had to answer: (1)  Batman (4)  Supernatural (8)  Serial killers (16)  The Bat (32)  The Flash (40)  Superman (48)  The War on Terror (78)  The Punisher  (96)   Other Stuff that may not have happened to you
Your story takes place in the DCAU, so the title will change to DCU.
I'd like to share a few of my favorite parts of the story.
A very personal note. If you've read any of my stories before, you know how frustrating that can get when your story gets published. It gets frustrating for several reasons. Firstly, the author has made a terrible mistake in deciding I had to answer "Batman" after answering "Supernatural", and because that's what I was going into. It meant that my answers will appear as "Flash, Killer Frost, Manhunter" rather than as "Supernatural". Now, I'm not saying this because I think I'm Superman. I'm saying it because at this early stage, I wanted to write as if I was Superman, not that I've heard stories written like that before. Secondly, all of these choices of word count and sentence structure (for me anyway) are deliberate ways to communicate my own personal thoughts and point of view. While I appreciate that DC Comics has decided that I'll write about them, I feel my opinions do not match DC's editorial policy, which seems to be "It's Batman, so Batman! That's it…" I think DC has made a mistake in letting its creators, and fans, see their own stories as though they were their own. They should be given the option of answering "Batman" if they want to.  I want to talk about things I'm excited about with DC Comics.
 Why I've started a new DC Comics blog on my Facebook page. You may not guess.  It comes very direct from my own experiences. Now, there are a lot of different things and I'm not saying the author is deliberately trying to insult me since the "Supernatural" prompt isn't as bad as I'd like you to
