 You make your way over to a metal door to open it.  The hinges are heavy and the lock is weak!  The interior is old and covered with the stuffs that were left there after a long time.  You have three minutes!  Find all the parts and build an iron door using the parts you found.  Try to make it at least slightly harder than the lock of the door?  Find whatever materials you can and do the heavy labor!  If there is a lockbox with some small pieces of wood you are missing that should be the next challenge - find three rusty lockpicks, some string, and some paper towels!  You do have two minutes!  Doors are really annoying in Skyrim (especially with a large number of players running around this place, trying to get into the door!), so start out on the low side, and don't be surprised if you have to break a few doors along the way. If you decide to build an iron door using a part you found (for example some wire or wood), it seems simple enough - just make a series of small holes in the door so that it can swing open and close with the key you have.  The small holes should be small enough to reach with a pick, so get a string and a few small twines.  Using the string between each hole in the door, you should be able to grab an actual handle with your left hand while your right wrist grabs a pin with the other.  If that doesn't happen, you're either using the wrong type of wire, or your threading is really weak. Try swinging the door open with one wrist - you should find that the hinge isn't terribly strong, but if this works, you can go ahead and open up the second and third holes and make a stronger hinge (remember that you have just made the door strong enough to open up with one hand).  If you can manage to use your left hand to use the string to keep the door open but the right hand
