___________ Are you a dreamer, or are you simply in search of a reason to live? Dream of the past, of the future, of the present with a little bit of hope and belief. ______________________ Make a list of as many things as possible to do right now that you believe will make a difference with the world. __________ The answer to this question does not lie in the future, but right here in this moment. Try to remember. ___________________ Start a blog. Write, draw, paint, cook, sew, or whatever you are most passionate with! Write it down and post every once in awhile for others to see where you are currently at in life. Write a blog about anything because the more you can connect with people you relate to the more positive your words and your writings will be. Be sure to share this post with anyone you know that might benefit from the same feeling, as well. _________________ Have a good day!
