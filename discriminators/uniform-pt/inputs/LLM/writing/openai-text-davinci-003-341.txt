My best friend and I had become like family, over the years. We went everywhere together and never wanted to be apart. So when I noticed the tattoo that she had on her ankle, symbolizing our friendship, had suddenly appeared on my wrist, it was alarming.

I was scared that this meant that something had happened to her and I was responsible for her death. That maybe I had done something wrong, but when I looked to my side, there she was, alive and well.

She looked scared too, and I didn't know what to make of it. I feared something bad was about to happen. We both knew that something was off, but we put on a brave face for each other. I was determined to get to the bottom of this mystery.

We investigated and eventually found out that everyone was born with a unique tattoo on their ankle, and when you're responsible for someone's death, a copy of their tattoo appears somewhere on your body. The only way to get rid of this copy is to accept the blame and live with the consequences.

My best friend was still alive and well, so I never did get the chance to accept the blame. But, I knew in my heart that the tattoo on my wrist was there to remind me of how fragile life really is and that I should cherish my friends while they're still with me.
