First, I'm pretty sure this is meant to be a joke lol http://superhero.wikia.com/wiki/Nope: It is NOT in a joke. It actually means, "You're a new super-villian." You are super. Now, I can tell that some have misread this as being all about you and your super powers/unusual powers, but you know what? This isn't it. You are a new super-villian and you are a new villain. The reason that this has no direct implication of anyone using your ability/superpower is because all villains have this kind of power (although some may not know about it). I'm sure that they may not feel it would be funny since some people are already into it. Even if it hadn't been said, you wouldn't be using your super power to murder someone... that is just pure logic of course. So, what's your favorite thing about this prompt? (Not a "biggest" thing, just something I know you'd ask yourself) So, which is my favorite? I think having a cool, dark, funny new villain/supervillain that also comes with a cool, dark, funny new theme would be the best. :) Now, if it's a big secret I have, do your best to keep it hidden, even if you won't make it visible on the flash file. This reminds me of how the secret that we did for "What if Harry Potter did a song about how magic can heal" wasn't really hidden, it was just in the file. The file is just an example of exactly how easy this might
