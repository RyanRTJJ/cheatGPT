The sun was shining high in the sky as the wind rustled through the trees in the lush forest. The forest was alive with the sound of life, birds chirping, the trickling of a nearby stream, and the mysterious whisper of the trees. It was a sound that had been in the forest for as long as anyone could remember.

Jasmine was out for a walk in the woods, enjoying the peaceful scenery. As she walked down the leafy path, something strange caught her attention. There was a faint whispered discussion coming from the trees around her.

Jasmine stopped and looked around in confusion. She had never heard this sound before. Curiosity got the better of her and she hesitantly stepped towards the closest tree. That was when she heard the whispering again, this time much louder.

The tree was talking!

Jasmine gasped in surprise and stepped back. What was going on here?

But the tree didn't stop talking. It was telling her something, something important. After a few minutes, Jasmine finally figured out what the tree was saying.

It was telling her to listen to the life around her. To be aware of the changes in the forest, the coming of storms and the disappearance of creatures. To respect the earth around her and take care of it.

Jasmine thanked the tree, and continued on her walk. From then on, she paid attention to the trees and everything they whispered.
