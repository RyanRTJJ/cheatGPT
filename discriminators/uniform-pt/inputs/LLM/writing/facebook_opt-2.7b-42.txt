  It was an ice cold moment when all I had left was her tears.
The question asked for the worst thing you saw happen in game. Not the saddest.
The question did not say the *worst*.   Read it carefully before replying. It asks for a story based on what you saw.  Yours was an account of the worst thing you saw in game and I asked you if you have seen more of what is actually in the game as one example of a story.
Well i have, but i did not think about writing one here, it's just not the sort of thing you can do well. Especially if memory serves me well.
I was thinking you had not seen the very worst that happens if you didn't see the very last thing.
Well im more into horror games, and stuff you can write about is harder in horror games than on a story game. That's why i like horror games better than story games. I don't think youll find any story games that make me cry harder than horror games, i think its the other way around.
I don't think you'd like my story much.
I'm sure i would, but i don't write horror stories here. Most people here only write love stories. I write my own horror stories though.
I never wrote one either and this is not my first experience with reddit's lack of horror.
It's more or less impossible to write a horror story, but it's not impossible to write a story that makes me cry. Its almost impossible though.
No, it really is. Tell it. I want to know what it was you saw.
Well its not a typical horror story, its more a game story. I can send you a screenshot of it if you're really interested. But it's got to wait until im on my computer.
