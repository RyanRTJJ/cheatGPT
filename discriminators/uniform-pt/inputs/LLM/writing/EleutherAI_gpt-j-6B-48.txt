I. This is exactly how I feel about life and how it could be perfect for me. I have no idea what my job is, or who I'm supposed to marry. Or what my children's names will be. It seems like I have a lot of choices, but it's hard to choose, because I have no idea what the consequences will be. 
II. I know what my task was, because I was born, I had to be alive, I had to breathe the air, and had to eat the food. I know that after I eat I'm going to sleep. Then when I go to the bathroom, I'm going to say my prayers for the day. (My son is a "morning people," and my daughter is late to everything, so I make them pray every night with me). At school I want to make sure everyone knows where they need to go, so then I'll know where everyone is in the morning. 
III. I have friends now, because the other day I smiled at a girl in my class, and she smiled back. We've been friends ever since. Now I can't wait until I get to go to the ocean everyday, and spend the summer doing fun things. On days my homework gets done late, I ask my parents to let me skip school. They're not happy with me, but they make an exception for this one day.
IV. I had to be born alive, and I have to die to see what my job had been. I didn't make it through the winter, because I was sick a lot. I felt like I had died, yet I was still here. I know how to find my parents and tell them I can't take care of them anymore. I feel relieved and ready to begin a new chapter in my life.
V. I'm glad I had to be born
