Growing up, I had always known that I had something that made me special. But it wasn't until I was 10-years-old that I realized how significant my number was. That was the year when my parents finally told me why I was different. Even before I was born, my number, one, was engraved on my skin. 

All over the world, every person born was marked with a number that grew progressively lower until it was my turn. As the first person born in my generation, I had the honor of the number one. 

At first, the people around me didn't believe it, or understand why it was such a big deal. Other numbers were just as special, right? But as I got older, I knew that I was different. Everyone could see it in my eyesâ€”the pride and the responsibility that came with being one. 

One day, I realized why all the numbers had been gradually going down. It was because with each new generation, our world was becoming better and better, and more people were inheriting a better quality of life. The significance of my number became even more powerful. 

Since that day, I have dedicated my life to helping others and making sure we continue to make the world a better place. I hope that when it's my turn to pass on, I will have lived up to my number, and that the people who come after me will one day carry on the same responsibility.
