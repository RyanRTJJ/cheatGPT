John had always been a proud member of the KKK. To him, it had been a way of life. Growing up in the Deep South, he had grown up hearing about the racial injustices faced by minorities and had taken it upon himself to join the organization to take a stand for what he believed in.

But one morning, John woke up to find himself in a world where things had changed drastically. The United States had somehow changed overnight and now the whites had become the minority. Everywhere John looked, he saw people of different races and backgrounds living side-by-side in a world of harmony.

John couldnâ€™t take his eyes off of it. The injustices he had worked so hard to fight against now seemed laughable in the face of such harmony and peace. He had to admit that he was impressed by the way that the world had changed and he found himself wondering if he too could be a part of the change.

John eventually found himself at a rally celebrating the new racial equality and he was surprised, but relieved, to find that he was not alone. He joined in the cheers and felt a sense of belonging for the first time in his life. He felt like he was home. 

John had grown up believing that whites were superior, but his new reality showed him something different and it changed him forever. He no longer saw any one race as better than another, and he now strived to be a part of the solution, rather than part of the problem.  He never re-joined the KKK, and instead spent his life striving for racial equality and justice.
