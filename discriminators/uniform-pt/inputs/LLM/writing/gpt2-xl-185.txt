 There's a problem with your memories, but the dream world is pretty well preserved. Maybe your body is a little off... What will it take to see him?
You never knew you were so angry... [GM notes: I'll go with the "the moon glitters" bit, it's a bit of a theme.]  You'd like to find out more, so the next morning you go to search the dreamy part of town and you go up into one of the buildings where they keep a whole lotta dreams. You're wandering around a little old town in a dark, wooded, moonlit, weird place. The dream world is dark, but the sky is a lil' darker, and in the center of the town there's a little shack where they all have long tables with a fireplace, and on the table is a lamp sitting atop some kind of wood stack. As you go up into the shack and poke around the place you're a little surprised to find out that the wood isn't made of wood, and what's in the fireplace is a little girl. Well, okay, not a little, but about the size of a house cat. She looks up into your eyes, and she snarls. "Sssst," she says. "You've made breakfast!" As you're not really paying attention this time you say, "What are you doing here?" And she shrugs. "What do I gotta do to get breakfast?" And you say, "Well, how did you know I wanted to eat some of the dreams?" And she snarls, "I see that. You're from another dreams, aren't you?" But you don't have time to explain, for she's run back into her own dreams, and with her she finds her parents, and she's in the kitchen, and she's trying to help them make breakfast. But you're having none of it. So you say, "What's up with you?" You say, "Are you trying to steal my breakfast?" She frowns, looks up at you, and says, "No, but it is pretty," and she raises a brow as she says,
