____________. What do you do? What will you do (and how will you make sure that you don’t accidentally change your time of death)?

A little bit about myself. I have been a writer ever since I was young. I remember my dad giving me an old typewriter when I was about 7 or 8 and that is when my dad noticed that I already knew how to type. He gave me my Dad’s first computer at 14. I have kept at the craft ever since, even as I entered college, and I am still at it, with the only difference being that I use technology. I have a Twitter account and I have had one for years, and it isn’t much more than some fun-and-games. This is mainly so I can keep up with my friends on Facebook, and I am pretty much on all of the other social networks.

My parents weren’t big on the computer but my mom did take me to a local typing club when I was a lot younger, and I got pretty good at them. I think I am a very visual thinker. I have always loved to see the things that I write before I write them. Maybe that comes from having a parent who likes to give me things as a person.

I want to make a few things clear. I didn’t “dontate” anything. I just got an idea to write a story about Wikipedia and the way that it works. I’ll admit that I also did “dontate” something, but I think that it is a bit different. If someone came to me with an idea, or asked me how to do something, I would definitely answer them. I wouldn’t “dontate” anything like the example in this question.

So, here is my work, and I am wondering if others would be willing to leave comments as to whether or not the first paragraph isn’t a bit over
