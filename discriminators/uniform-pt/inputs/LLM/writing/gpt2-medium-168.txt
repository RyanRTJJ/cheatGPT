 What makes this even more interesting is how their action plays into a larger story arc, as it will eventually guide the player through the story of the quest in question.  For example, I could write a side quest that was about a woman visiting the town where my main character was born, with her deciding to start studying law instead.  This has led to the main character gaining the skills of a law student at university, and perhaps even making a living as a legal clerk. Another interesting sidequest would be about an elderly retired military man who is contemplating retirement.  What would happen if he became wealthy enough to hire a private detective, hire a private investigator to investigate his retirement, and then hired a private investigator to kill him? What would happen if he got more money to employ the private detective, hired a private investigator to investigate the secret meeting, hired private investigator to kill the retired former military man, hired private investigator to find the former military man, hired private detective to take the retirement from the retired former military man, hired private investigator to take the retiring military man's pension, hired a private investigator to find the retired former military man, hired private investigator to get information from one of the retired military men.
