The life I had lived had been filled with highs and lows, but nothing could have prepared me for the horrors awaiting me when I died and made it to heaven. I had grown up going to church, believing that when I passed away I would ascend to the heavenly abode, a place of mercy and everlasting peace. 

But when I left this world and found my way to the heavens, I was shocked to find that the paradise I expected to find was no more! Everything was scorched, the pearly gates melted away, and the streets of gold had been turned to dust. The beauty of the kingdom I had associated with sacredness had been replaced with shadows of death and destruction.

I looked around in disbelief, trying to make sense of it all. It hit me that God must have decided to bring Judgment Day down upon us, wiping out his creations and punishing us all with annihilation. So in a twisted way, I guess I was blessed to find myself here in heaven, spared from the despair and agony that anything left behind on Earth must have experienced. 

As I wandered through the charred remains of what had once been a place of hope and salvation, tears flowed down my face. Eventually, I made my way one last time through the broken gates and said my final farewell to the home I thought I would have for all eternity. 

Bowing my head in acceptance of God's will, I took my leave of Heaven and began the next stage of my journey in the afterlife.
