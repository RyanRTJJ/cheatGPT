 I want you to write a story that is about how memories could be used to get a powerful advantage in a fight.  (or I'll read yours anyway :p)
Alright, here we go.  "I hear you, you little twit," the old man said, shaking his head. "This fight has been going on for all of eternity; I should have let you win by yourself." He thought for a second. "Maybe memories aren't the best way to control people. Maybe you're onto something, here."
Good job haha!  A little more to be added: "Do you remember when I used to go after you for kicks when you were a little kid?"  EDIT: Forgot a word.
Thank you, friend. It was my favorite bit, it just wasn't exactly the best of ideas to start off with. That's why it was included last, haha.
Cool! Well now I'm going to go find that part again lol.  EDIT: Fixed your sentence structure.
It was my favorite bit too, and that's the part I made the worst of, haha
I think a bit of that could be fixed by changing  "I was a bully"  To something like  "I started a fight with you earlier, we got along well"  Then you could still make use of the emotions that are tied to memories in it all the while trying to make it sound like you got along better.
I'll give it a try, friend. But be prepared, I had a bit of a fight with a mod when I tried the original one, it's a different one now I think, as it wasn't to hard to edit.
Hmm I'll be at school for the rest of the day but I'll get back to it tonight.
Alright, friend.
