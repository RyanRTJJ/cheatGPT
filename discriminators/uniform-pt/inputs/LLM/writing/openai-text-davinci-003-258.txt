The smell of sweat and paint hung heavy in the air of the theatre as the lights dimmed, signaling the start of the show. I nervously took my place on the stage, praying that I wouldn't make any mistakes while I preformed my part.

I had been chosen to play the part of the princess in a fairytale, and I had been rehearsing for weeks, so I felt confident that I could pull off the role nicely. On this particular night, however, something was off. As I took my first steps on the stage, I noticed that the props were not as fake as they were meant to be. The sword I was supposed to use had a dangerous looking edge, and the shield I carried was heavy and looked capable of withstanding a blow. 

I hesitated for a moment, wanting to warn someone about the dangerous props but quickly thought better of it. The play had already started, and I didn't want to break the scene. I kept my mouth shut and continued with the show, hoping that none of the other actors would come to harm. 

Unfortunately, that was not to be. A few scenes later, one of the actors swinging the sword around was cut badly, and the theater was filled with screams and cries of alarm. I felt guilty for not speaking up, but it was too late now. I clung to my hope that this experience would not be repeated, and that our director would make sure to use props that were not dangerous in the future.
