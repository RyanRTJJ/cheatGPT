The ancient legend tells of a great and mysterious power. Any who can master it, can wield incredible strength and courage. The people of the land have heard of its potential, and so a great quest was set out to find it.

Three brave adventurers - a knight, a rogue, and a wizard ventured forth in the search of this power. For many weeks, they journeyed by land, but found nothing that could fit the description. The same result was yielded from the sea, and night after night, the trio returned empty-handed.

In desparation, they decided to reach for the sky, for possibly the power could only be found in the heavens. On the third night of their journey, they reached the summit of a great mountain, and their eyes beheld an incredible sight. Before them lay a lake, and in the middle of it was an island.

On the island was a stone temple, and float above it, an orb of pure light. With every beat of its pulse, the orb growing brighter and brighter. The trio knew they had found the power they sought and so they approached the temple.

As they crossed the threshold, they were greeted with three words: "One if by land, two if by sea, three if by sky." Taking a deep breath, the knight, rogue and the wizard stepped forward, determined to claim the power of the mysterious orb. And so, their quest was complete.
