No one ever realized that I had no idea what I was doing. Everyone thought I was an expert in the field and looked to me for the answers. But, in reality, I was always just 'winging it' when I was summoned to defuse bombs.

The phone would ring and a terrified voice would be on the other end. 'Please help,' they would plead, 'we have a bomb.' Then I would be there in a flash, taking charge of the situation and allaying their fears.

Little did they know that I was completely clueless about defusing bombs and had no idea what I was doing. In truth, I would go through the motions I had memorized and hope for the best. As I pretended to be methodical, I would be frantically praying under my breath, 'Please don't blow up. Please don't blow up.'

Amazingly, against all odds, the bombs never exploded. Everyone would celebrate my 'heroic' work in amazement and I would accept the praise with a humble smile.

I never had to tell a single soul that I was completely clueless about bomb defusing. Everyone believed that I was ranked number one in the world for a reason. Little did they know that my trade secret was that I had no idea what I was doing.
