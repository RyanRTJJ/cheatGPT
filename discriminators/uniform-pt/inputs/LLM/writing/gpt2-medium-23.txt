 This leads to a conflict that lasts almost forever--the war is very well written. ----------------------------- An interesting concept that has been discussed is a battle between two opposing superpowers.  Do you want to know who wins by fighting?   How do you decide?  Or perhaps, there will be only one winner.  This may get ugly fast and it is always cool to be able to predict what would happen--this idea is fun.  There may be a way to see where your country would be if both powers were at each other's throats instead of just attacking.   The story of what would happen if you fought against other power is interesting and exciting.  I enjoy it at the same time. ----------------------------- The idea of your country under attack in some form.  It seems that most games have this scenario, but usually the player doesn't know why.  I have heard about games where the opponent would attack after the player had played a certain length of time during the battle.  I am assuming that there would be some rules involved. ----------------------------- What is the most interesting plot? There are always good situations to be told.  You can find them in game books or in other sources.  If you want to think about plot to be creative, you can do so.  One good example to come from a novel is James Bond's plot of how the U.S. would react to the loss of France in World War II.  Another is in Jules Verne's classic French classic "Mystic Journey".  You will find things that will intrigue you. ----------------------------- Is there any way of adding some of the more dramatic things in game books? If you love your fiction for other people's enjoyment, this might not be for you.  But it is good for story-telling.  If you want to read some romance, you might find it interesting.  If you want to enjoy a movie or video game where they make you question yourself, this is a fun way to do so. ----------------
