They cannot wear any of their old clothes again if they change their mind to wear something else. They must start over, which will require some time, as the shop will be open and they will need to return for it and buy their new clothes. However, they are not allowed to change their mind and walk out, as that would be considered a great disturbance and would also be punished.
