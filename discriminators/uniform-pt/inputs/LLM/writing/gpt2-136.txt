!! And while there is a great deal of irony attached, this happens because the idea of God's plan of human salvation was an illusion created with the help of the devil that had nothing to do with the concept of the 'God of Death!' (D. 6:10-13; italics added). I'm not going to touch on the fact that the notion of 'God of Death' was originally popularized by "soul" and "flesh," only to fall prey to the belief that it is all in the hands of the Devil.

A soul's rebirth does not necessarily happen by any means at the behest of humans or other living creatures (I've talked at length about how the notion of 'death,' as well as death itself, have been a significant force behind many anti-religion themes from the Christian period, such as in Genesis 23:22-24 (which is just a simple example of both concepts being taken for granted by the mainstream world), but it is.
