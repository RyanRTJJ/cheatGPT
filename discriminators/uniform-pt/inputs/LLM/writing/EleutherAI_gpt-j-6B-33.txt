How does a vault owner get there position in society? And how exactly does he or she control what others are allowed and don't get? And for what purpose is this vault in its current state?

Answers:

One of the perks that the vaults have is that they can be anywhere. So if there was a vault that was located in another country, and a vault that had one of the world's most important scientific discoveries in its vault... they could be in two of the world's most different places.

So in that case, it might be like having a vault in Switzerland, and one in the heart of a giant desert.

The vault owners have pretty much everything and anything; so if the government is trying to control that, there would be nothing really good that they could really put there (aside from weapons for personal safety--and that you would probably have)

The more you think about having vaults everywhere, one of the ideas would be that vault owners own their vaults, so if they want something done outside of a vault, they have to be able to make it happen (and there probably isnt a way for that if a vault isnt there)

Answers:

We have a vault in Switzerland that holds a vault in the middle of New Mexico.

The vault in New Mexico has a vault in the middle of the country that the people of the state own.

All vaults have the authority to make whatever decisions they wish. The vaults must be run only by good people, and it follows you can say there is a law protecting the world's greatest scientific discoveries.
