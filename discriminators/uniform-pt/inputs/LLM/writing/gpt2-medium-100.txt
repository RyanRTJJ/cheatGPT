Dear Robert E. Howard Fans,

It seems that you all have been quite upset about my opinion of you. I am certain that you are the ones who came here with the idea that it was my idea and that I did not create the whole concept with the same mind as you guys! If it is true and I was a fool to let you in the dark, then you are the ones who have been guilty of that.

I have seen people go over to your old site and write the kind of comments as much as half-assed apologies by which, well, they know I did not create such a thing and they know you did not write it. You must be thinking that you think I write this on purpose and I can take it, you fool! I did not write the word "magic" on your site to begin with, or even the title of this letter. For goodness, you have nothing but a bunch of ignorant, old-fashioned people thinking so stupid you would want your children killed, when you know I have created no such thing and you know I know it for sure by now, but you continue to pretend to believe it despite being unable to see the reason! It is because it is just a bunch of old fashioned ideas with no factual proof behind them that you and I disagree. I also don't believe a book can be magic, but there is no such thing as fiction. I certainly don't believe a book is a writer or that they were writing it. You need to check with one of the other writers that wrote magic stuff instead of you! And I don't think you should try to use words with the words that are not in your mouth, either.

I am going to ignore your apologies for my words, and try again, but only if I
