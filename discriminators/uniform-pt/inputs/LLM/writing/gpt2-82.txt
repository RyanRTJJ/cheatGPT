 And if you were on a train that stops at a different train station, you'd find your friends in the back seat and ask "Are they all dead or alive? What is the situation here?"

And if you wanted to read a story based on this line in another person, you have to get the person out of their car.  If you just read this prompt the person is coming from there.  It doesn't matter if they're in the back seat with a group of coworkers or you can only look at your fingers, if you were to see the person in a moving vehicle, you might not want to go out of the house.
This is a common practice with almost every scenario that I've encountered when writing my own writing.  This is why the writing prompt is so important.  The writing prompt in itself is important to make your mind and emotions more effective.
