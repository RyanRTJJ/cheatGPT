Nina woke at 4am, as if someone had hit her, and she sat bolt upright in her bed. In the dark, she felt a presence from outside the bedroom window. She blinked and looked around the room. Everything seemed normal, but she still felt the presence of someone watching her. She wouldn't have noticed it except for her strange ability â€“ a kind of sixth sense that let her feel when someone was looking at her.

Nina had discovered this ability as a child and it had come in handy for things like flirting and stealing. Her parents didn't even know about it, but she had become something of a minor celebrity among her peers. She was able to feel when someone was checking her out, and then give them an extra special smile in return. However, she never expected to have it wake her up in her room at 4am.

Carefully, she got out of bed and crept to the window, looking outside to see what it was. In the moonlight, she could make out a figure standing in front of her window, watching her. She quickly jumped back with a yelp, and the figure ran away.

Nina was shaken and scared, but also angry. Her strange ability had alerted her to the presence of danger, and that was something she would never forget. From then on, she was always wary when someone was watching her, and it gave her an extra sense of security.
