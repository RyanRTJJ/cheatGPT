'Kid, its not the villains who have an agenda you should be worried about, but the ones simply having fun.'

The elderly man- the old wizard- spoke these words to the orphaned young boy standing before him. The boy was twelve, and his once black hair had begun to fleck with gray. He had seen enough heartache and suffering in his short life that he could recognize a veiled threat when it was presented to him. He knew what the old wizard's words meant: to not trust those who seemed to be harmless, that danger could come from anyone on a whim.

The old wizard saw the understanding in the boy's eyes and nodded, readjusting his robes. "You must always remain vigilant, young one," he said. "The ones having fun can be the most dangerous of all. They may be careless and reckless in their pursuits, not understanding or caring for the consequences until it is too late."

The boy nodded, though he didn't quite understand. He only knew that he would take the wizard's warnings to heart. After all, the old wizard had seen more in his lifetime than the boy had in all of his.

The old wizard let out a breath, giving one last nod before continuing on his journey. The young boy watched him go, and in that moment, he swore to stay ever vigilant, no matter what seemed to be on the surface.

The old wizard's words had been wise, and this he knew, for deep down inside, he had no doubts. No matter what fun was to be had, he must always be aware that danger could come in any form.
