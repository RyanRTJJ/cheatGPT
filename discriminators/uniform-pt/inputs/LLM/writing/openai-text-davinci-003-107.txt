It was the end of the world, exactly as the ancient prophecies foretold. The air was filled with a dense fog that obscured the sky and all but snuffed out the first glimmers of dawn. All around the entire planet, people scrambled to find shelter from the inescapable destruction. But here I am, standing in the middle of it all, unmoving, my mind strangely at peace. 

In the face of this apocalypse, I am strangely calm. I feel no sense of panic, nor do I feel a need to rush and secure my own safety. Somehow, I understand that whatever may lay ahead, I will be ready to face it head on and with the courage of my convictions. 

With each passing minute, I can feel the world around me crumbling, yet I just stand there. I'm in no rush. I no longer feel any attachment to the material things of this world, nor to its fleeting nature—the possessions and experiences that years ago seemed so important now float around me, unimportant, as I cherish this one last moment of contemplation. 

In the end, I know that I feel fine. Far from being scared, saddened, or concerned, I find joy in this moment. Maybe this is what I was supposed to feel all along—maybe my heart was meant to be freed from the throngs of desire and cares that the world imposes upon us. As the ground begins to shake and the world slips away, I stand still and ready, my head held high, knowing that I am prepared for the next journey—whichever it may be.
