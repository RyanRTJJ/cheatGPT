 Also, what is the average birth rate in your world? And why do you think that is?
In my world, there is no 'norm' at all. Every baby is born with their own unique number engraved on them, but over 300, which means almost everyone but newborns have one.  Overpopulation is a big problem! The government is trying to take us to a planet only for humans, but a lot of nonhumans are trying to colonize the planet and are killing us. It is just one war after another. I don't really know a solution, but it is a really sad world.
Maybe it isn't as bad as it is because of the low average age of birth over 300.  When you are only 300, the world can seem like a very big place!  And then on the opposite end, when you are almost 700, it is much smaller again!  A lot of fun times with those kind of numbers!  And now, you are giving me some writing ideas...  Good for you!
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing!   Haha, don't use me for writing ideas. I don't even know what I would write about if I wasn't so bad about writing. But hey, I know the feelings! Hope I helped!
You did help!  I'm going to go with a story about a group who must find a way to get a whole bunch of people on their ship in one piece....  This will be a very human story...lol
I can always use a human story! I'm going to write it too, I promise! ðŸ˜‚
Me too, thanks.  I may post it here after I think it's done.  Good luck!
