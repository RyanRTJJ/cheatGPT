It was a typical day at the Johnson household. I, Bill Johnson, was the stereotypical fat and lazy sitcom dad. I was content living this kind of life. I was a mediocre employee and a stay at home dad for my three kids. Eating junk food and watching TV was my daily routine. I was comfortable with my life and my routine, but I knew deep down I wasn't happy with myself or with my situations. 

One day, something in my head clicked and I suddenly decided it was time to change. I worked hard and kept a strict diet in order to lose the extra weight. I devoured books, magazines and anything that I could find to try and educate myself. I even got a promotion at work and was thriving in my new life. 

Soon enough, people from the TV network caught word of my amazing transformation. They asked me to come in for a meeting. I was almost certain that this was my big moment, but to my surprise, the network told me to stay the exact same as I was. They had wanted to create a show out of my original character. 

My transformation had made me a different man, one who was admired and respected by others. I wanted to keep moving forward and leave the character of "lazy sitcom dad" behind for good. I told the network that I must decline, but was thankful for the opportunity. 

I have never been happier with my life and who I have become. Despite all the people who asked me to change, I was always able to stay true to myself and become the best version of myself that I could be.
