 We get together the story that happens after, and what the implications are for our new reality.
The Science of the Future – Part 10
Why bother doing things like this?  Because science might very well one day help you better understand the world around you.  You might one day want to create or enhance artificial intelligence to help you with your more mundane tasks.  Then in the future you might feel like your understanding of physics might suddenly improve as well.
Science works.  It's a great way to do science with your brain.
It works because scientists are motivated to do science.  When they are motivated to do science, scientists are able to produce the best results they could.  Science is not hard and you don't need to be an Einstein or an Albert Einstein, to be able to understand the world around you.
Don't take my word for it, take a look at these videos I made as Science on the Future segments and check out the full Science on the Future archives (you will need to have VLC Media Player installed, please see this link for instructions ).
Forum Questions
We have a general Science on the Future Question Forum here.  If you have a question then be sure to post what you are curious about.  We try to post questions related to science in the "Science on the Future – Part 1 – Part 2" sections instead of posting the more advanced questions you might get asked there, because the answers to the more advanced questions could contain some really cool, potentially really important stuff that you could never get to by asking an older student about this topic.
Science on the Future was created by my former professor, Professors T.J. Kucera, L.C. Hopper, and Professors Richard M. Hooper and Brian M. Regan.  All of us in this department started this series of Science on the Future segments because we are passionate about education and having fun while doing it.  We have been having a blast and learning a lot from each student that
