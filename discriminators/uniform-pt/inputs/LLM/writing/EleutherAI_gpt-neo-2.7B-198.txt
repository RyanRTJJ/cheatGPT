When a ghost comes to stay, does he stay in the guest bedroom? The bedroom? The attic or on top of a haunted house roof?

Or is he a serial killer, an alien, a ghost, or an undead creature? Or maybe a fairy, a sprite, an angel or even an old uncle. In any case he is mysterious and scary, and must be hidden.

Where does he stay? Who?

A house has just been sold by a young couple. Everyone on the street knows the house because the previous owner was a well-known family. There are pictures of every family member.

The new owners want to tear down the house. But the couple don't want to give up until they see what has been left behind.

What does the ghost keep in his bedroom as if he would leave his clothes there to avoid stains on his white sheets? Does it just move around or does he leave a skeleton dressed in a white sheet by the door?

Who is he?

  * Who lives in the guest bedroom where the ghost stays?
  * Who is the son of the ghost?
  * Who is the grandson?
  * Who is the daughter of the ghost?

Who or what is in the guest bedroom? 
  * a vampire
  * a fairy
  * an angel
  * a spooky monster
  * a very old or very strange lady dressed in white
  * a young woman dressed in a white robe with wings or a white gown and white wings on her dress

  * a black man wearing a white sheet
  * a white man or a white creature
