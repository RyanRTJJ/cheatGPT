In my first novel, "Honeymoon in the Sky," the title character, Pauline, is in a bit of a pickle. She loves her husband, John. But she's afraid he'll leave her if she asks him to move the family into a cottage down on the shore of the lake that they bought to celebrate their 10th anniversary.

She's stuck.

"We'll have to compromise. Find us something a little closer to the cottage than the lake, I suppose. It's just that I love that cottage, and I hate to give it up."

Then Pauline does the only decent thing she can think of. She and her friends go to live in the cottage, to be close to John.

I love the first few chapters in the novel, but it becomes a bit annoying for me to read as they go, because I'm waiting to find out if they're going to stick with the plan of moving in to the cottage, or just go their separate ways.

What was your motivation in writing this story?

The story in the novel is essentially about two women in their later years. I wrote it mostly for myself for one of the reasonsâ€”one of them wants what I want. I'm not as good as she is, and when I'm in the same boat, I find myself doing the best I can. So I wanted to write what was in my head.

I don't want to turn this into a list, but I'll give you a few things:
