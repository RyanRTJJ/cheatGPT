 
**MORAL** | You go back in time to rewrite 'the future of the bible', you have to remember the biggest blunder of mankind when they used a book written by a single god and made it as an all-knowing book for millions of years before Jesus Christ. They had to write another book, 'Judeo-christian scriptures', to prove that Jesus was the son of God and it's still being followed till date so that people don't realise that a book was only written to enslave mankind and destroy their natural life cycle.  
**REWARD** | Rewrite 'the future of the bible' and let people see how an ancient book was used for an ancient purpose and let them realise that they had to learn religion from their own natural life cycle and not from a book designed by a single one creator. Let them realise that it's foolishness to go and kill a man whose only crime was to try to understand God, which you thought was so simple to understand in that time, you can't stop a few people to read a book written by another person.  
**NOTE** |   
Remember, the world will not see the result even after your death. You have to write it as if it is in your future and if any of your friends and family read'rewritten' bible or'rewritten Quran' they will think what their own book written during that time did to save people's lives.
