 Edit: Aaaand here comes the Reddit anti-Semitic circlejerk again. I'm sure this will make me seem less ignorant.
This book is way to long to make a compelling story. The amount of time spent in making all the animals in the bible, Noah's Ark, etc would not give you the opportunity to make a really good story line involving that long a time period.
I didn't mean to imply anything. The "big" books are still written in the past tense.
The bible and Quran are not stories to be understood in their own right, but in the context of their histories and cultures, the bible can still be described as a story
I think that would be a valid interpretation. But some would say that the interpretation has no relevance to the subject.
The Bible in its entirety is history with fictional characters, but if you are interested then the most interesting parts are in Genesis, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and Chronicles.  The Quran is similar in some ways (particularly in its focus on Abraham), but it just doesn't go into such detail
Interesting, thanks. Now you're just confusing people, so I'm removing your submission.  But you *can* post this in /r/Christianity.
No problem, I am familiar with the history behind the Quran. I was just saying that a novel would be very difficult. The fact that I have a history degree means that people can see my intentions for the question before clicking onto the thread. They were downvoted though, I didn't have time to read past the second line of text because I had to get ready for work
That's the reason I posted it here, in /r/TrueChristian since there is a lot of people who are interested in the subject.  I hope you understand what I mean, I wasn't trying to get you in trouble. Thanks for your help!
No not at all. I appreciate it and so many people are so nice on this site.  It amazes me that there are just so many good people on here.
