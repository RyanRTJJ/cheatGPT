A little story I wrote about robots attacking us all. Well it sort of started as a story, and I knew, as the story was really becoming more of an inspiration and starting to show up in my work, that writing the story was kind of pointless since all the robots knew what happened. So I stopped writing out the story, and instead wrote the last two chapters of the story, where no one did any good. The first one was written based on the story- I wrote the first chapter in December but really got stuck, and it was only when I started my writing retreat at the end of the month that finally I finished the first chapter. The second one was written in a sort of “free writing” mode, using the words, emotions, and feeling that I felt. At the time when I started writing that chapter, I still didn’t have any plot direction which sort of made writing the chapters a bit weird.

This prompt will be set aside and my first draft story will be put on hold for a while.

This is my original character, E. She is the first person who will show up. The machines that I create will be created before E, and I will describe her in the story. It is my hope that this first character can set the tone for the story for me, and by example from her, the characters can help me create my characters.

“She looks like a doll with clothes, and shoes, and hair.”

“She’s not here to take your heart. It wants you to open your heart to her. You need to learn to love someone who’s willing to let you go.” – E

(And yes that is a reference to The Wizard of Oz) I have no idea where I got that line from, but I’m glad I made the connection.

The machines that do this, or as I called them the
