_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ An Ithacus is born on a winter's day, one in nine. The world rests in his palm. He has no fear of anything, for everything is at his whim. He has a home to keep him safe with the warm fire in his heart. He can change shapes and live in anything he wants, all he has to do to live is keep his eyes open. He wants to be in the sun all day; he wants to live inside the clouds. He wants to go anywhere he wants, to make it his own. He lives alone as a slave. His master gives him commands every day. If he does not obey them, he can feel his life slipping away. He never sees the light of the sun. If he does not learn to follow orders very soon, he is bound for the underworld. His home was filled with secrets and stories about men, and the Ithaca was filled with men who had stories to tell.



He is a man of great strength and courage. What a time for a slave! Today I am about to be a slave, for now I am bound! I am the sun, I am the stars and all the universe is for me to make. All I have to do to be happy is to keep my eyes open. My mind wants to think out every possibility; my body wants to make every move. I am like this because I must! If I don't learn to follow orders very soon, I am bound for the underworld. But how can I learn to do what I want if I am all bound for the underworld?! Well, I know where there is the most freedom and safety. I can leave the cellar and go out. I can stand up for myself and walk freely. I am like this because I must! The underworld is like this, too. I am like this because it will help me to have strength and security. I am like this
