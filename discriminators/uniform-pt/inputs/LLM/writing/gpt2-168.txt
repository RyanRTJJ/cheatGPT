… Well, I guess I'll have to make it harder… I see.

He is referring to the one who left this place in the start. Although he is a very rare NPC, I guess he will just be known as the "NPC".

Since I gave him a warning, I guess he will be the one with the knowledge.

「It is a simple process and then I will tell you something that you must be grateful for. Please go back home. You will have to leave tomorrow. It is time."' 」

When I said that, it was obvious to me, but I had no idea who it was.

「If you leave tomorrow, then tomorrow will be tomorrow's day…」

In other words, I will get up in the morning, and then I will go home.

Although we did do that because our preparations are so high. It seems there is not enough time for us to get out of this place, but then, what about us?

「You are thinking…that I will leave if I get away from you like that.」

Is such a strong, and I thought even so.

「The reason I stayed here is that you want to fight for the world. That is why you can't go home without having a plan…….」

I understand why this monster who wants to fight all is on my mind.

「… What about I would leave if you want to fight?」

What does that mean?

「You should be prepared. You have been warned of things on the way to this place that we have already been doing. It is in your heart to join the party at that time.」

「I see? Then you are a troublesome…person?」

I was at that place, but the one who was at that time didn't make a show of coming out, so I have come out from that place again.

「Then… What happened? What happened to you before?」

Well
