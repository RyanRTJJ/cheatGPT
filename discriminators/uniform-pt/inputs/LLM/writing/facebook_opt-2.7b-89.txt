  Edit: I got no clue what this means. I have no idea what "flavor of reality" means. I have no idea what a game is. I have no idea what a role playing event is.
I know what you mean. In RPGs, it usually refers to a one-shot setting where everyone plays a very specific character, with all their history, experience, etc. The character's backstory is written (or pre-written), and they generally have some sort of power, such as super strength or immortality or whatever.   I'd have to agree with katj, though, not really a good fit.
Or is it just a way of saying "any old setting from any game/book/movie"
Pretty much, yeah. Any setting that isn't the setting of a specific game. Like if you had been reading a book for years and one day said "I wonder what it'd be like if it was in a space fantasy setting" and just started writing something up. Or if someone else on here had read a post and you had some ideas or thoughts on their idea. You can do whatever you want.
Hm, yeah, I suppose. But it would have been neat if it had been "how your mind creates a setting from the scraps it pulls from the fiction you consume/know" rather than just "set in a fantasy game"
You could just imagine it in a game, with the same rules, in the same universe, with the same people.
I suppose that's true. It would make a neat little game. The main issue is that it's really hard to tell which characters are real and which are in your head. Maybe it would work better with fiction you've read a book for years, but you've never really read the whole thing. Like if you had an idea for a sci fi novel, but you'd never have the motivation to do it.
