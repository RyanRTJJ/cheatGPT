!!

I'm planning to go on a short trip to the US this coming November. It will be my first time in the States as I've never been to the USA before. I am a huge fan of flying and I am interested in visiting the most important country before me that has made such an enormous impact on my life and has always been such a special place.

It goes without saying that I would like to take an airplane and go from Alaska to New York City (if I remember correctly, I had been thinking of going over to Alaska or Canada, depending on the flight time. But alas I'll be taking a flying trip to see the USA in person.)

So I'm thinking what would be a good air travel destination for me to see the world in? What are some of the key places, attractions and places to see in the USA that I can take a plane/bus/train/boat/whatever?

Here are my ideas so far:

California, especially San Francisco

New Orleans

Washington D.C. the Capitol

Horse show
New York City

Aunt Bee

Grandma's cooking

New York's Big Apple

Anywhere, really, you are free to suggest any of these places. I am especially interested in seeing what is popular and what is not with each.

I've heard of Las Vegas, so I was wondering what it feels like, where is it and any other tips that you can give. What do you recommend and/or why is it so popular?

I'm planning on taking a trip in August to NYC, and was wondering what people's favorite spots would be and what activities would make for the best time of your trip. (I'm assuming there won't be too much going on that people will be too excited about!???)

Also, would anyone be interested in the same idea as above, but going from there all the way to San Diego and Los Angeles? Maybe doing the coast and leaving from San Diego?
