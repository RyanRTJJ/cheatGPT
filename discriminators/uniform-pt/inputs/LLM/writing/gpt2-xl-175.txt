 You pass another lone door and a stone man sits in the doorway, staring. You're unsure how they got in, but you have your keys so you are in the process of making your way towards him when you are interrupted by this voice in your head: "Hey look, you're just a young man and you've just come out of the woods, how old are you?  I don't think you're old enough for us."  You start to say something as you look at the door that you just entered, but at that moment something is moving very quickly towards you.  You scream and run the last two steps to the door.  Before you can even open it you hear two more voices yelling out to you in your head. "Hey, I am a little older than you!  I'm a bit older than you!  You're just a kid!  You're a kid!  You're a little kid!" You see the stone man, and with the rest of your body your head starts to explode and you become a gibbering wreck.  In front of you are five of the most scary guys you have ever seen.  What do you do now?  The situation is a bit ambiguous.  This room has something you don't understand - something you will soon find out about - but what is it, you wonder? A giant oak door, a stone man, and some very mean looking guys.  You decide you'd rather not get out of this room alive, but you figure that you're not in any shape to fight anymore.  So you just wait.  Until you start seeing more and more green lights.  A large piece of metal that you know is a wall comes down.  You know what it is, so you just run when it hits you.  So you run.  And you run.  And you run.  You run.
