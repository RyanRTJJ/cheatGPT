_____________________________________ It is not uncommon to see individuals in the U.S. claiming race, creed or religion does not matter. In fact our society's history has demonstrated that not only are people from all backgrounds equal, the most important question is not what you look like but what you look like to society and to ourselves. I am going to go into more detail in upcoming posts regarding topics such as, Black or White. By the way please read this in full. (Click Here If you have a Kindle or any other ebook reader read this.) One of the many misconceptions of race and race relations in this country is the notion of race being biological or an innate quality. If you have ever traveled to Africa or Asia this does not necessarily apply to you, the fact that the average African has blue eyes is irrelevant, what matters is the individual's overall appearance. What is important here is the individual's personality. We are all wired for each other and the human race is one of the only places where there is no artificial barrier. By looking at an individual's natural behavior, and comparing that with how people of different races relate, one will easily find out what is truly the racial makeup of a person. An individual's physical appearance and physical traits are not unique to one race but will also reflect what goes on with each race. For example, we do not find a Caucasian baby to be Caucasian based on his haircut, or his clothing, or how tall he is. The Caucasian baby comes from many races to the exact same height. What determines his race.

A baby born within a particular race has the same genes as an individual born with a different race.
