 There is a collection of pages to go with it and this book is a nice reminder to have a backup of the past, past, past.  Even if we don't remember them all. If you would like to read them over, you can click here.  For this book, though, it's about how many books you had that day. Then instead of buying five years for that, you bought three years.
The books in this book cover over 100 years of vampire history. For more than that, he has written, with his name on the cover, two memoirs (one on the vampire story, one on the house's origin and evolution, etc), as well as a couple small volumes of notes, including the first book (not yet called The Curse and the Devil) which was given and released in 1997; the second book, The Curse and the Devil, was released in 2005 on a very limited edition "old" paperback, with both books available. Other than that, my advice to all, this is a fairly safe bet reading for anyone in a serious relationship.  The best is really to stick with it. There is so much more to learn in this book than meets the eye from the first chapter.  For now, go read this book on the road; have some time to read, and then head back home to your comfort zone. For now, read: The Curse and Devil: The Complete Guide by Dr. Kiefer Sutherland and Robert E. Howard (HarperFiction.com.com).
