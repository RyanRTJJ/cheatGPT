I'm sitting in my home office, and within five feet of me is my sealed box of art supplies. This box is light green with a tan lid, and the sides are padded with a foam material to cushion the inside. It's a rectangular prism, measuring one foot in width, two feet in length, and six inches in height. The bottom of the box is scuffed and scratched, as it was bought used in a flea market.

The lid has a gold latch that fastens the top securely, and if opened reveals a bountiful assortment of art supplies. On the inside of the lid are several pockets, both sewn and Velcro, that contain erasers and art pens. In the central chamber of the box lies all the supplies color pencils, pouches of adhesive, and a modicum of brushes and sponges. On the left side of the box is a soft divider, which offers an extra layer of security and separation. Here, I store my more valuable items, including the numerous charcoal pencils and a set of fine-tipped markers.

Overall, this box of art supplies has been in my life for many years and has served me faithfully during my artistic endeavours. Until recently, it was stored in the loft of my old apartment, but it has now taken up residence in my home office. And despite the numerous scratches and scuffs, it still remains an integral part of my creative life.
