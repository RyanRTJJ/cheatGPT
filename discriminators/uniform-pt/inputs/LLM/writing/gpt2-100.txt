********* It is a time bomb waiting to be unleashed, and it's my life, my life's work, my life's work that gives me hope, hope." It is a time bomb waiting to be unleashed, and it's my man's death that will make this place happen. It is a time bomb waiting to be unleashed, and it's my life, my life's work, my life's work that give it hope, hope. The people who work to make a better world, want change faster than anything other than that. They need to stop blaming others and demand respect, and they can end this horrible struggle within ourselves just like those we know and love: by being like them, giving up, letting these people go their own way for the better, and starting over again and again. Let us be the people who change for the better. Let us break through the glass ceiling and let ourselves go our own way for the better, and let us live our lives the way we want to live. Let's be brave and be brave. Let's stop all violence and let's allow the people of the world to win every day, because we don't need violence to defeat us. And let's set a goal. ******** * It's your work, yours, your life, your life that's making us different. We want this to come together, for a better tomorrow. We want every day more safe for every child who's in need from around the world. We want every day to be a new beginning for every kid who needs the same help as the last, and we want a brighter future, where we're better not worse. And we want a brighter future when every generation has its own vision for tomorrow and wants to see that day. We want a brighter future that makes a future for everyone, where everyone's lives matter and what matters the most. We want a brighter future that connects everyone who is different, and that gives us a voice
