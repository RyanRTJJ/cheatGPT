 It's also not a metaphor - a fruit is a fruit. 
The name of your story is chosen.  This is basically a voting poll.  Here are some criteria: 1.  Is it fun?  2.  Will it be a good ending to the story?  3.  Is it original?  4.  Do you have a better idea for how this story could continue?  5.  Does the story work as one piece?  If it does, don't change it.  Otherwise, keep it the same.  If you have a really good idea for how this story can continue, but you're going to have to sacrifice a few words for it to make it into the story, by all means, change it.  If you're going to do it anyways, you might as well have fun with it.  If someone else has an amazing idea, please try it out, even if it doesn't fit.  If you think your idea isn't that good, you should probably change it.  Just keep an open mind.  In the end, you have to trust your gut sometimes, and that's where all the fun is.
Don't change a thing without talking to me first, please.  If you don't have time for a conversation, don't change some things.  If you choose to change even one thing, you've put the story to rest forever.
Also, in addition to the story-in-writing, there are two (optional) prompts that will appear in the main story.  They will vary depending on your choices.
The first one, is the "question" prompt, as the name implies.  If you don't like the answer, that's your problem.  The answer is: you will be asked this question and it will determine the end of the story.  If you don't know the answer yet, I wouldn't go making decisions about the story
