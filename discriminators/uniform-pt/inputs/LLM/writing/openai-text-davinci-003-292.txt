Dana had always been content with the way her life was: safe and stagnant. Whenever she had been presented with a choice, big or small, she had always thought it best to stay in her comfort zone and avoid any risk at all costs. Years had passed, and yet nothing had changed.

But Dana's mind changed when her parents moved her to a new city. With a fresh start, she found herself taking more risks- going to school events, joining clubs, and making new friends. All of this was new and uncomfortable to her, but in taking these risks, she found that there was growth and progress in her life that she had never seen before.

It was then that Dana realized the importance of taking risks and of facing conflict. Without conflict and the risk of failure, her life had yet to move forward - she was still living the same day, often relying other people's decisions to take the lead.

But by embracing the possibility of change, instead of avoiding it, Dana opened up a world of opportunities for progress. It wasn't easy and she definitely stumbled along the way, but she found that when it came to the biggest decisions she made, those that came from her her heart, the resulting progress was worth it.

Without conflict, there was no progress or change. Dana knew, for the first time in her life, that if she wanted to move forward she'd have to take risks. She had to be brave, willing to accept failure and learn from mistakes, in order to finally experience the change she desired.
