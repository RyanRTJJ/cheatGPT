  (Also, I am a little surprised at how well this post has gone over. Good job on the writing, guys! And by "guys", I mean "us"), and remember to keep writing stories every day, at least one! You can still find us at r/WritingPrompts and in the comments below this!
Oh man, that is a brilliant prompt! I *loooove* letters. You write them to people you love (I'm still a bit raw about everything) You write letters to old friends about how much you appreciate them, people who are lost to you, people who may never see you again, people on the other side of the world who may not even know you exist. And you write letters to imaginary people who sometimes think the very best things you have to say.  Fuck, now I want a letter.
