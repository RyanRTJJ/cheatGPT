******************* THE SHOPPING CAMP (the one where I bought this armor) Â  ------------------------- We're at a shopping mall, a shopping mall. A white haired boy, wearing plain clothes and carrying an AR rifle, watches us enter the market. The girl in the white shirt, looking over to us, says "Hello and welcome all of you and our lovely store owner. He is our friend, Harry. He's a friendly and smart guy. What do you want? How much are you willing to pay?" "Oh! I'm not so cheap and stupid. My price is twenty thousand dollars." She asks the guy in the red shirt if he can help her purchase her next item. He says "No problem, that's all the money I have. Take off your coat and gloves and let me help you. I'll also take you to the checkout line and help you with payment. Good night." He hands her the weapon. She takes it and walks out the window and back to Harry's house. He calls out from a distance "Don't look back." He stands there motionless staring out at the crowd of shoppers. We walk into his house. ******************* CHESTER'S ROOM ------------------------- Harry steps out into hallway. As he approaches the far side of the room, he hears voices. They are voices claiming they are looking out for him. He pulls out his AR pistol and aims it at them. Several of them yell out orders. A group of several girls run through the door screaming that "he's here, Harry! He's here!" He backs away as fast as he can. They hear a click and then Harry is gone. He turns to see a girl, maybe sixteen years old, just as tall as Harry and about twelve feet. A brown colored girl with a black hood pulled tight over her eyes walks right up to Harry's face and kisses his forehead. She holds out her hands and says "You have money for us?" Harry grabs her by
