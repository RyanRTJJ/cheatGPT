 Your superpower changes the world in significant ways, and your classmates realize it. They must try to figure out how to keep it from changing the world too soon and losing the power they thought it would bring.
So... a Harry Potter story, but with superheroics?
Yes.
I'm going to try this! It sounds like a really cool concept!
Great! You should post your final work. :P
Will do man! Thanks a bunch!
Also, if you're interested, you can post your story on /r/heroespowers, which is a subreddit specifically for this kind of thing. You can also link to your story here so other people can read it (we have a lot of people on the subreddit with your style (not necessarily your actual writing)).
Thank you. I've been meaning to go post this somewhere. I'm just so caught up in this now that I can't find my phone... :P
No worries. Just figured it'd be easier to refer you to a subreddit that already has a large readership.
Ah, cool beans. I'll post it there after I figure out my phone. I have no idea how this post even happened. Not my phone, no one logged onto my computer... I'm confused.
Your phone is your computer.  If you log into your computer using the same login as your phone you can access your desktop and post directly from there.   I hope you figure out that issue soon, it's annoying not being able to see that you got any response from someone on this sub when you make a thread.
So that's a thing. Thanks again! It really means a lot that you took the time to let me know that this exists.
