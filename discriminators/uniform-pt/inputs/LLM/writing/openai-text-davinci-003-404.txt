I was out for my weekly hike in the forest I used to go to when I was a child. I had stumbled into a clearing and stopped to take in the scenery when I heard a sound behind me. I spun around to find an alien standing there, looking frantically around him.

He looked up at me with relief in his eyes and I noticed something odd about him. His skin was pale blue and his eyes had a glint that seemed almost alien to me. He stepped forward and asked me if I could help him.

I asked him what he needed help with and he said he was an alien fugitive looking to hide on earth. He said that he needed my help and he could offer me the opportunity to travel amongst the stars in return. At first, I was hesitant and I told him I couldn't do that.

He implored me, explaining that if I agreed it would mean I could travel to places I never even dreamed of. To see the vastness of space, to explore new worlds and galaxies. In the end, my curiosity won out and I agreed to his plan.

He took my identity and disappeared into the night. I spent the next few weeks wondering out to the stars, exploring all the places I had longed to go my whole life. I never forgot the alien fugitive that night, though. I knew that I had made a huge sacrifice, but it was all worth it in the end.
