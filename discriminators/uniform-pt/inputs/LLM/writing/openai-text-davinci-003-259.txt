The day started out like any other. I stumbled out of bed, already hearing the clock ticking down the seconds to my imminent lateness. I threw on my shoes, grabbed my things, and ran out the door, hoping against hope that by some miracle I'd get to wherever I was going on time. 

But as usual, luck was not on my side. As I ran down the street, trying desperately to make it to my destination, I watched helplessly as the bus pulled away from the stop, leaving me to catch the next one. I felt the same disappointment brush up against my spirit like a cold December wind. 

Then I got to the cafe, where I was supposed to meet my friends for breakfast. My hopes were soon dashed as I watched two of them walking away, deep in conversation, as I rounded the corner. 

However, something strange happened as I walked to my next destination. For some reason, I caught every single green light I encountered, no matter how heavy the traffic was. I was astonished, and the feeling of accomplishment was like nothing I'd ever felt before. 

Finally, I arrived at my destination — a meeting — on time. I couldn't believe it. For the first time in my life, I had actually made it!!! 

From that day forward, I made a conscious effort to be on time. I stopped watching busses pull away and girls get asked out, and focused instead on the journey ahead rather than the opportunities I had missed. I took control of my life and my time, and it made all the difference. 

My life is still far from perfect, but I now understand that being late is not a weakness — it's a choice.
