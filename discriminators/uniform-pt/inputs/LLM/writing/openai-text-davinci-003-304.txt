It had been a normal day, like any other at Larsup High School. Despite being new, Mark Johnson already knew his way around the campus. His peers had noticed him walking around with a hoodie and a backpack a bit too heavy for a 17 year old. His teachers had gotten used to the boy in their classrooms, taken aback the first few days at the intensity he held in his gaze.

It was when the police had started talking to Mark privately that the rumors began to swirl around the school. Everyone had been talking about the possible motive that had pushed him to this breaking point. Everyone had been guessing who, what, and why someone would come to school with a gun. No one saw it coming, not even Mark himself.

Mark had been having a tough time, with his parents going through a messy divorce, a crushed self-esteem, and bullying. His peers had been exploiting his vulnerability and loneliness. To escape, Mark had taken up a hobby of woodcarving, improving his grandfather's tools and making intricate pieces out of wood. He had found solace in this hobby, the comfort of the firm, heavy axes and the placating sound of flint against flint when he carved animals into the wood. 

He had eventually taken his hobby a step further, bringing a gun and ammunition to school as well. And when he saw a group of bullies that had been tormenting him in the hall, he pulled out the gun and started shooting. The chaos and commotion soon followed, with teachers running from classrooms and students screaming. 

The police had soon arrived and subdued Mark, but the damage was already done. His targets had sustained multiple injuries, and Mark received a life sentence for his act.
