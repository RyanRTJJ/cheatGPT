I was feeling so bored at the party. Everyone seemed so aloof and only talked about the same old topicsâ€”the weather, the barista at the coffee shop, what plans everyone had for the summer. I felt the need to escape and break away from the mundane conversations. So, I left the party and walked to the nearby garden.

The area was peaceful, and the cool night breeze was refreshing. I lay down under a large tree and stared up at the night sky. It was filled with twinkling stars, and I felt at ease as I admired the night sky.

However, just as I was slipping into a peaceful slumber, I noticed two beady red eyes looking down at me from the branches of the tree. Startled, I quickly jumped up and stepped back. The figure blinked at me, and I was relieved to see that it was actually a small fox staring at me. It must have been curious, because it always kept its gaze on me as I settled down again.

We stared at each other for what felt like forever before I finally dozed off again, feeling at ease. I never knew why this small fox decided it wanted to keep watch over me that night, but I was thankful for the company.
