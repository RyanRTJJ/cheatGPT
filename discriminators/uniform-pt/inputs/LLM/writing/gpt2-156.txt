[Halloween] #1: The Night Witches

Advertisement

If you want to know what the Night Witches have done, you must know "the night witches" by their Latin name, D. wythos. "It seems to be a secret religion," explains one writer, "the night witches are believed to be a sort of gods-kings of the late 20th century."[This quote is credited to Brian Grier of the New York Daily News.]

The Night Witches have a religious background, says writer Scott Daley: Though they were thought to go by the German names "witch" and "god," the word for god is "wohnt," according to writer Paul H. Gittman, "and, when describing them, the English term was 'wohms.' A WILD WITCH had been mentioned among the early occultists, and, in their writings, called 'the WILD WITCH.'[They] sometimes wrote letters to the king of Germany at the dawn of the 13th century demanding "the worship of the with witches in Rome," according to H. G. McCollum, author of The WILD WITCH: A History of the Mystic Tradition. The occultist's call may indicate their obsession with the worship of Witches of the Valley of Lights, which they believe is a time of great joy and love for the occult. The WILD WITCH is supposed to be an age-old rite of initiation. (It may be a nod to its original purpose, for both Pagan and occultists have a tendency to say that it originated in a young family of witches named the Sisters.) The term is derived from the term "witch." Today there are "daughters" of women who are sorcerers living around the world, or simply sorcerers. The wifed name for the Night Witches is Vardellna, also of the Latin word meaning "witch."[2]
