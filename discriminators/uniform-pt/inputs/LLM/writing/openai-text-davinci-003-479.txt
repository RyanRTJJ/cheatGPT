My mind was my own little world, my secret garden of wild ideas and inventive plans. And I was the master of my own domain, surrounded by my thoughts and feelings like computer applications covered in glossy, colorful icons.

I lived my life in my little universe with comfort and ease until one day something strange happened: my brain antivirus software popped up. It was unexpected, and I must admit a bit confusing. I had never seen it before, and I didn't know what it was trying to tell me. Despite my confusion, the bright warning message displayed prominently on the laptop-like screen of my mind had a message I couldn't ignore: 'Warning: potential viruses detected.'

What kind of viruses were inside my head? I was very confused, but my viruses apparently weren't just in my imagination. They were real and present, and I was determined to find out what was going on.

I examined my thoughts and feelings carefully, and soon I realized the viruses had entered my world when I stopped listening to myself and to the people around me. In my attempt to manage the world and all its voices, my antenna had gotten a bit broken and my immune system was weakened.

Perplexed, but determined to fix the issue, I decided to reboot my system. I shut down all my mental programs, restarted my brain, and rebooted my imagination. I then installed a new antivirus to better protect my world, and I monitored my thoughts and feelings more carefully.

Slowly, my system returned to its normal state, and I was able to live comfortably and creatively in my mind once again.
