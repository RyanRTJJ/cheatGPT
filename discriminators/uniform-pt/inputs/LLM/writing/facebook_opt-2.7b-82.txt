  Then tell us how it goes! Maybe you'll have just one and only one.
I would love to see your response.
I did this once by playing a really loud fart joke to an unsuspecting guy at a crowded store. He looked like he was in serious pain. But I'll be damned, he just stood there and laughed the whole time.   I thought it was pretty funny. Even after about 100 farts I'm pretty sure he thought there was a war going on.
haha. I think it would take me all evening to get a hundred farts out of my mouth. I bet the other people around were annoyed by all the farts. :P
We laughed pretty hard. He was a cool guy lol. It was definitely a great experience too.
Well, what did he think of the fart? Did he laugh or did he stop in his tracks?
I can't remember exactly but it was probably a mixture of both. It was the first fart in a while that didn't hurt the inside of my mouth.
Hmm I'm intrigued now! lol.
My next fart is going to sound awesome!
Just don't tell me what you're farting, so I'll be in suspense with you like that!
I swear haha. I hope they are too. I'll probably make a gif out of it soon.
haha! Well good luck, be safe and have fun!
Thanks! I'm at home right now. It's getting late so I'm going to bed. Have a good one buddy!
goodnight and goodfarts!
If I fart it will be awesome :P
haha ok, I'll do my best to see what awesome it is...
