 Do you remember how you first discovered the sacred blade?  You are a wanderer, and upon approaching this small town on the horizon, you notice a glowing sword hidden in an alleyway. You are intrigued and decide to explore to find the wielder of this blade.
[I do not remember how I discovered it sorry. But my character has many stories/ past life experiences, so you can assume it was something to do with my past life. ]
[What if I take your story and use it as a basis to write my own? I don't really want to have an original character but I didn't want to take your idea and write my own. I'd have to write around it, but what the hell you're on reddit]
Ok I will take your idea. Though the blade might be more in the shape of a knife.
[Sorry, I'm too excited. If you don't mind, I'd like for you to give me a little bit of time so that I can write my own. I won't leave it too long cause it's not very long but I need to read a book, and I have no idea how long it will be]

[I have a few things to do tomorrow, a lot of the time I won't be on but there will be some times where I could do some cool things together. Do you have skype?
[Nah I don't. I use Google Talk I think. It's pretty good once you set it up, I made a lot
