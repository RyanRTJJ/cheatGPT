So as I was coming down on my birthday, my mom called me, and I told her I'll give it a go. I was afraid that it would be a waste of my time, but it was very important to me at the time, so I decided to go along with the plan.

As I was sleeping in the last night on my birthday, and waiting for the call from mother, I realized that I was a cryo for 20 years. I was just an average little girl, so I thought, how many people have ever been cryo from age 20 to their own death, and what would it be like?

Then it hit me...I would wake each day, wondering if I will see my mom again...

I also thought I will never see my grandkids...

I also would never be able to go to the ocean or ski on a hill with my friends, play with my dog, and hang out with the family, and then I thought about the other dream, my wish. It was actually my dad who gave me the gift, and it was a huge smiley "yes!"

This was my first night in the cryo room, and I slept like a baby. I heard some people talking downstairs, and I slowly got up to listen. I was listening to them, but the most fascinating words came from a middle aged man, and some words were, "My life has been empty until the day a human was needed in my time..."

Then it went silent, and the next words came from another woman, "This is the greatest gift and why it's called a gift of life..."

It's a real, real life experience, and i would like to thank you, Mr. James, because this book, "A man's life is empty until he needs a human to complete it, that is a real gift."

I'm 20 years old, and
