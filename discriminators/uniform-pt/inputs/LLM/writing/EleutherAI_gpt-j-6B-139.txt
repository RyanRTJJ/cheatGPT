"We've known this day would come. The world grows old, and humans need a new beginning, a new beginning that looks to the future, not the past. It's time the world learns that. We had a leader, but he wasn't strong, he couldn't think, he couldn't do what was required to succeed.

I call him an idiot, but then you probably don't understand me."

—Sixtus the Sixth, one-half of the Emperor of the Second Empire and now known to the world as the Second, one-quarter of the world's leader

It's a story where a group of people are taken away in a space capsule and sent to a far-away planet. When they get there they set about fixing up and upgrading the capsule until they arrive at their destination which happens to be... a world which is in the same exact shape as our own. Not a bad story to look into.
