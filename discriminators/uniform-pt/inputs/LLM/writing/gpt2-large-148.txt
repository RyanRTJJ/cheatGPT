What You'll Need:

-Sculpting paper (1/2 yard)

-Clay, Pencil, Scissors or Other Material (I recommend just using the "paper" material, for simplicity's sake)

-Wooden figurine

-A Sharpie to paint the word, words, pictures of the figures

-A Cloth sack and a Plastic bag

-A Pen-knife

-Paper tape

-A Styrofoam coffee table for the figures


Instructions:

Draw a rectangle a few inches from the base of a large-sized wooden figurine. Mark the figurine's center.


Remove the clay, pen and pencil from the figurine and paint a line onto the cardboard piece representing the center of the figure, where the center of the clay will be.


Draw a line across the rectangle, and remove the pencil or the clay.


Draw a new line, at the same spot.


Draw the same line, but using the paper and pencil to paint it, with the clay as the base.


Draw the line across the first line, marking the line, and remove the clay.


Paint the paper and pencil using fine to medium sanding paint or any other medium that'll leave a good impression.


Tape the clay onto the paper, leaving about 1/2 an inch of room to breathe.


Place the paper onto the plastic bag, as shown, and use a Cloth Sack and a Plastic Bag to hold the figurine securely!


Open one of the plastic bags in the Cloth Sack and pour the paper over it.


Cover the bag with the remaining paper, and use a Cloth Sack and Plastic Bag to hold the figurine securely too!


It's a very good idea to keep the figurine on the ground overnight if you are taking it on a trip. The paper would have a good chance of absorbing the light and heat of the setting sun. (Or
