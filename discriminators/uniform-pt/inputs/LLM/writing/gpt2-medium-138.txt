------------------------ If you didn't finish your puzzle, return to the start line of Quagmire and try something else. You'll have to play again if you have completed the puzzle. -------------- If you failed to complete a puzzle, the story "We've always been there" is revealed.
You'll need the following items to do so: a compass, a hammer and some rope (one will be supplied as soon as you begin playing--the rest come after you finish). ------------------------ Once you have all the items and get to Quagmire, head to the center tree in the center area of the level. -------------- In the center area of Quagmire, there will be a rock and some dried bones. If the rock is not picked up before or after Quagmire, the bone fragments will be missed and will have little effect on the quest (the bones just disappear when you start over). If left in the middle of Quagmire, they remain until after you pick up the rock near the top. ------------------- In the center of the level you will meet the character with the green armor (it isn't actually him because he is missing), Jody. ------------------------ The person in the orange armor, Lila, will tell you that she knows how long you've been in Quagmire. After the quest "The Tree of Courage," the stone door will unlock, freeing you from the Quagmires to return to the beginning of the game. Note: If you missed an objective, a note will notify you when you return to Quagmire (provided you complete the objective). -------------- Quagmire appears in the following order: (1) Quagmire (2) Quagmires Town (3) Quagmires Farm (4,5) Quagmires City (6) Quagmires Cavern (7) Quagmire Cavern (8) Quagmires River(9) Quagmires Cavern (10) Quagmires Shipyard (11) Quagmires Town (12) Quagmires Town (13
