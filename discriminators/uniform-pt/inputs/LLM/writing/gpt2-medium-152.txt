_____________________________________ - If you are an artist: Take pictures of different symbols on your face. The best symbol is the one you choose to make when you're looking at a thing you're holding. You can put different colored words on the picture that makes it look like multiple pictures of the same symbol. When I draw in my mind, each time I draw something, I remember how my previous drawing made this symbol look so different from the other symbols in my mental picture. A couple examples: a flower that comes from the center of a tree = different from the center-top one, because the flower is taller and is made from wood. a star on top of a person = in my mind, a bird with wings, and some feathers, so I draw that bird with winged feathers. a star with some metal on it = in another way, there is an icon of some sort, but I can't remember where it is right now. you are supposed to stick something on the line of your picture, like a line of the word "hope", the letter "A" of hope, or, even better, a word from the sky like "eagle" (or whatever you got). a snake with its mouth open, its eyes peeking through it's skin = similar to the line of the letter eagle, but that's because I see a different shape of the sun, a different symbol on it than I saw when painting it, and I can see how it looks different so now it's easier to draw the skin on that snake, because now it's something I can touch to imagine it as something different. A couple examples: a bird with wings with a red spot = I drew that bird with the same color on my face the first time I saw it, even though
