____________. All the other people who've been born in exactly these numbers are currently waiting in the wings to die. Can you help each other reach the other end sooner? If your friend is number one, and you are number one, you're dead. If your friend's number is one, you're dead. If your friend's number is two, you're dead. If your friend's number is three, you're dead. If your friend's number is five, you're dead. If your friend's number is six, you're dead. If your friend's number is seven, you're dead. If your friend's number is all the way at the bottom, you're dead. If your friend and you are both numbers one, your lives are complete, and in death you'll unite the worlds."

My name is ____________ and I've been at this all along.

"Now wait a minute," you protest, "all of these stories sound like they're just a bunch of crap. Your friend must be dying from some crazy fever and we all just got here."

No. You are absolutely right. That can't be what's going on. And even if it were, isn't it obvious that the most logical explanations for this situation are also more likely than any of the possible craziness that's been proposed?

I remember that I'm the only one of my friends who has always been at the bottom of the totem pole, and as far as I can remember, I've never died, never had a partner, never had an illness, never had any problems. You are, of course, right. But one of my friends was just born, so it's not surprising that he isn't going anywhere too soon.

But wait. Isn't it possible that this is how time really works anyway? You have to be at the very end of the totem pole to die someday, but you're never at the very top.

No. It's not.

The idea that there are some people who live forever
