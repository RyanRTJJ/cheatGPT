25 years ago, the world began to receive messages from the future. They told us of things to come and all of the disasters that we must prepare for. We tried to heed their warnings, warning our populations and governments, but still we were not prepared when the events began to occur.

One calamity after another, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, it felt like chaos had a grip on our world. But then, something changed. For the first time in a long time, no more messages came. We were wary, afraid to get too comfortable, but with each passing day, our hope that things had changed for the better grew.

Slowly, the world began to heal. People abandoned the war for peace, countries rose to help those around them instead of bickering and attempting to attack. Nations joined forces, forming alliances, and slowly but surely, the world started to rebuild.

Without the constant threats of disaster, cities started to build up, emerging from the destruction that had once been a daily reminder of the chaos of the past. Technologies advanced, the economy grew and people were able to find ways to help one another. 

It's been decades since we stopped receiving warnings from the future, and life has changed drastically. We now take every opportunity we can to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our planet and all its inhabitants. We won't forget the warning messages, and we will forever be thankful for the moment when peace replaced chaos.
