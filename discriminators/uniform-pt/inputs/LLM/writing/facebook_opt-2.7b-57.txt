 and now you regret it.
That's exactly what I was thinking about last week. But my heart wasn't in it so I didn't write it. I don't have a kid, but I do have two siblings who don't have mothers. Thanks for the response.
I'm not sure if I agree with your suggestion.  I've been reading this book that was published in 2011 where this author took a bunch of stories and stories of families and connected them and this one book is the one that was the most similar to yours.  This led me to think that maybe if you did put the story here it might inspire some other people to post a similar story.  If I had the time it would be something that I would write for my daughter.
Yeah, I think you're right. I'm too scared to try something like that though--like I said in another post, I may have a heart issue. That could be the "trigger" for something happening. My sister has an ex who is still in denial. I feel bad for her--I feel sad. What else would they do than to blame everyone else?
I think she would just ignore it if she were in your situation.  I know for me I'd feel hurt though - being disowned isn't easy at all.  If you have someone else who you could use for advice maybe you should give them a call.  You could find a church group or online groups to try and connect with people.
I've had a couple of chats, nothing too serious, with some of my co-workers. They're actually just a great bunch. I'll probably reach out to more.   I'm not sure what I'm going to say to my sister. I don't know how she will react. I don't want to make her mad at me, and I don't want to hurt her. I don't know what to say, or do, or really who to be there for.
