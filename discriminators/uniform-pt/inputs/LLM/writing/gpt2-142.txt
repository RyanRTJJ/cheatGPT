 To do it, we must leave our planet behind here. And with it comes the fear of alien invasion—so much so that we can no longer take our children, much of our property, and even our own people. And this is why, just like in the original post, here's my thought on what to do: We must take action now without waiting to see what's coming next. And we should be talking about things like this before they're too late!  I am going to go through my own example with the most frightening moment for those involved, though—the day the first alien visitors arrived.  I was working on the script and was surprised and angered to see the aliens.  Just as we were about to leave for the airport, they came around and started to walk, and the whole movie went off as if it were over.  Some of the aliens, I was sure, were the ones who were trying to steal the film, so I ran back, and saw it was the second time.  I didn't have a clue what they were trying to do.  They were trying to rob us off the ground... and if they didn't take the film back home, their cars had to stop and haul in the equipment needed for the first time. Then there was the one who was on the ground and was taking the cameras when they made it into the first photo at the end at that particular airport. I was laughing so hard over this. The guy was very serious that they would take him out, and the fact that we, as human beings, can make mistakes, it wasn't anything they were trying to happen.  I did as they said and I won the movie. The world over.  So they didn't know what was happening but when they were down, I was standing back again and was trying my best to not feel like I was being taken down, especially if I was trying to make someone else lose their life.
