My name is Joe, and I'm the bartender here at Manny's Pub. The place has been here for as long as I can remember, and it's been my home away from home. You see, Manny's Pub is notorious for being the bar where every single "Walks into a bar" joke has occurred. 

Every Thursday night, a handful of regulars come in to eat and to drink and to tell their jokes. I know each of them by name â€“ there's Joe the joker, Pete the poet, Phil the philosopher, and Mike the master of the mic. Each of them has their own signature joke, but, amazingly, each of them has a different punch line. 

Every night, Joe the joker starts us off with his classic: A priest, a rabbi, and a lawyer walk into a bar. Then Pete the poet follows up with his patented, A bear, a lion, and a meerkat walk into a bar. Then Phil the philosopher chimes in with his twist on the classic A mouse, a cat, and an elephant walk into a bar. Lastly, Mike the master of the mic closes the night with his personal favorite, A snake, a rat, and a bird walk into a bar.

By the time they've finished, us bartenders are rolling on the floor with laughter. Manny's Pub may be known as the home of every "Walks into a bar" joke, but it's also known for being the place for friends and good times.
