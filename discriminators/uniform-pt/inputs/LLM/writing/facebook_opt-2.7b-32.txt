 Then just do it. Write it up, get feedback, rewrite and grow from there.
Very close to the question though :P   It seems a bit of an open-ended answer, as he mentions aliens etc. Perhaps the plot point would be the new species' desire to return to the previous state of humans once again, to start a religion and worship the 'god'.
That's part of the whole point of this prompt, if I remember correctly. The other ideas people give will have to be incorporated some other way.
I think it was a request of an open-ended answer? :)
Oh, I just saw the 'open-ended' bit in the title. Thought I was responding to the guy's question. My apologies for mistaking the two.
You didn't really mistaking it as far as I can see. It was a nice question indeed, I was just pointing out that the prompt is actually open-ended indeed :D
The thing is, I didn't realize how open-ended it was until after I posted my response.  It's one of my pet peeves when people don't specify what they're looking for first, and then end up saying a lot of questions for which I could have answered one.  Not that it really mattered, since nobody responded. Oh well.
That was kinda my point, I wanted to know what people want to know more about first :D  I am just glad it didn't matter at all, I think the final result was quite interesting :P   No problem, I think I am right now actually reading more replies on this than I have read on any other thread, so that's pretty good I would say! :)
Hey, thanks for being so polite about it.  I'll remember the open-ended prompt in future when I get into
