   Use a Christmas theme, or a holiday theme, or a Hanukkah theme.     I expect a wonderful and creative piece of fiction from you!
I thought I'd write about the meaning of family, the joy we can have in the smallest details, and even a little bit on the history of Christmas.  The word count is about 5-15 though.
I'm pretty interested in hearing the results!     Happy holidays!     And a Merry Christmas.
You too! I just realized I need to do the outline now!  Have a Christmas season! :)
Thank you so much for writing a wonderful story! And yes - it's always a good time to outline.   Merry Christmas! :)    EDIT: I would like to add that I do not take ownership of these stories or claim any ownership myself. I wrote them with the sole intention of being a positive inspiration during the darkest of hours. I'm not at all responsible for what happens to these stories! Thank you all for the wonderful comments and support!    EDIT #2: /u/pixabay_username

I would love to write more stories, so if you have any ideas on how to encourage more creativity or just for a positive message, please, throw them my way. I have a full day ahead of me. Hope you are all well!
If you've got five minutes I've got another story for you! But I want you to know I will absolutely read it once it's done.   Have a wonderful holiday season, and a Happy New Year! :)   EDIT: And remember, there's always plenty of people more depressed than you are, so never forget!
I have been told the same about my writing.  I hope you have a wonderful holiday season as well!
