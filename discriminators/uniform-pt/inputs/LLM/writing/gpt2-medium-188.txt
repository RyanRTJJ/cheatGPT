 When you have completed your task and you then tell your employer that you'd like to see this power toy once more, they will allow you.  You won't be granted access until they've been notified that you've chosen to tell them about it. At this point, you should know exactly what power you'd like on the ring.  It would be good to read up a little more on how to tell if the product contains some sort of emotional stimulus that makes you more or less inclined to pay attention to it.  If you've decided to buy a ring that has this one ability, and you need it to remember something for its next owner, you shouldn't be too upset that one of your friends is getting another magic item as a result.  If you've been given an item that can recall memories, you may not notice this, but if something is interesting then you'd be surprised. It seems fairly obvious that you've been given this power and should seek it out.  Your employer is going to try and use your power, but it's quite unlikely you'll be the one to actually be given one.  You are probably going to be invited back after the job interviews to see if what you were given makes the jump to better business. After you've received the ring and are told to give it some time to fully prepare, you need to go to your school to study, where your employer offers you a small discount. Your employer may also ask you to send them a photo of a "friend" of yours that you could send a message if you were to miss your shift. You might remember this after seeing their profile on some sites - if so, you know that your employer has a special kind of friend who they're interested in.  You also need to send your text again, before it's too late, so that your employer knows where to find you (you can download this code if you'd prefer and leave it as is). It's actually unlikely that they will be offering you a "test"
