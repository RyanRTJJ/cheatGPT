  They say that if you write while being tortured you will die faster, and you've already started so might as well go all the way.
*The Secret* by Rebecca Stead fits this description, though at the time it had the rather unfortunate side-effect of making the main character completely insufferable.
I was going to write something about this book but then I thought about the possibility of Rebecca Stead being the author and realised I should probably leave it well enough alone - that is, if I hadn't already bought the book somewhere. Damn you internet. Damn you.
I had to read *The Secret* when I was a teenager. I read until halfway through and decided it was too much of a load of old horse shit. She also did one about the author of *To Kill a Mockingbird* which was great, but at that point I had stopped caring about her work. This is my first encounter with her writing, and I wasn't disappointed.
Agreed, I didn't really care for the book until I was in my late teens. But once I started reading about characters being tortured and tortured and tortured and finally bit it just went full Monty Python.
That's pretty much exactly how it happened for me.   I don't normally torture or torture anyone so much as break them, because breaking people is what I do. But then I read The Secret and I just felt like that was what I should do to people, because they were horrible and deserved it. I felt *so* powerful.
I didn't notice until I had to read it in college and they asked me why I read about it
Yeah, there was definitely a bit of 'whoa, this is fucked up' in that book.
