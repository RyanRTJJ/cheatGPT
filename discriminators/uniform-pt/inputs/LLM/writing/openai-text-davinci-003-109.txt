Once upon a time, there was a man who understood that life was fleeting and he desired to gain control of his existence. With a wish for knowledge and fulfillment, he prayed for the answers and for guidance.

God felt his heartfelt plea, and answered his request with a gift—the gift of a choice. In the fields of bright emerald grass and amongst the azure sky, God presented to the man three doors.

Through the first door, God told him, lay eternal happiness. Through the second, infinite knowledge.

But Door Three, God warned him, was a mystery—the choice was his, but if he chose it, he may not like what he found. God had never opened Door Three before, and knew little of what lay beyond.

The man was conflicted. He wished to gain knowledge, but also craved eternal happiness. He examined the doors, one by one, hesitating with each decision.

Finally, the man chose Door Three, opting to trust in God's advice and take a leap of faith in pursuit of what he believed was right. When he opened the door, he discovered something that surprised and enlightened him—an entirely new world of magic and adventure.

The man had taken a gamble and won, and with that he found a newfound joy and peace of mind. With that, the man thanked God for the gift of the choice, and set off to explore all the wonders that lay behind Door Three.
