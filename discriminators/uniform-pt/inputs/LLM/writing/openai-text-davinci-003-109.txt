It was apparent right away that Kurt was not an easy person to get along with. He was known around the office as being rude and abrasive, always lashing out whenever things didn't go his way. Even when his colleagues tried to be friendly, he still maintained his aloof stance.

The only person who seemed to really connect with Kurt was Jill, his co-worker. She understood that beneath the gruff exterior, Kurt was actually a kind and caring person, just incredibly lonely and broken. Although Kurt never spoke about it, Jill sensed that he had suffered greatly in the past, causing him to close himself off to the world.

Over time, as Jill kept being friendly to Kurt and showing him kindness, Kurt began to slowly let his guard down. He even seemed to enjoy her company. And although he still had his outbursts, his colleagues started to sympathize with him and even care about him.

However, their newfound appreciation for Kurt was short lived. Just as quickly as he had changed, Kurt reverted back to his old ways. He was back to being the same rude and abrasive person he was before, pushing people away and reverting to his aloof stance.

Jill was hurt, not only because Kurt had suddenly changed back, but because she had really started to care about him. In the end she simply accepted that no matter how much she cared for Kurt, she had no power to influence how he behaved or treated others. But he still had her friendship, and that was good enough for her.
