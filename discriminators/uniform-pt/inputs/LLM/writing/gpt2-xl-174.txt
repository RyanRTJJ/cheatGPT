 There is no right or wrong answers here, just the story.
Writing a story with this prompt has worked wonders for me. Not only do people often become interested the story, but because I'm trying to relate what I wrote to something real and real I'm getting more feedback with the writing. I've gotten letters from people telling me how I described a similar feeling, what was the moment in their life they felt it and also how they felt about it. All of this feedback from people has made the writing more cohesive and more personal.  It also makes it feel really good to write something down and get words onto paper. I hope you're having as much fun writing this as I am.
This prompt has been featured on my blog, Good Night, Good Life, and in the  Stories  magazine as well as in the  Hollywood Reporter in the article, "How the Script of 'Caddyshack' Inspired Michael J. Fox and Danny DeVito to Give it Full Throttle".
