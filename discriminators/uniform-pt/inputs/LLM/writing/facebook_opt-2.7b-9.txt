 You could also write a story about the human soul that is eaten by the spirit of the dead, or something like that.
That's a good idea. I think I'll write something new instead. I like the concept and I wish I could pull one off, but sadly I can't. It'll never work.  Thanks!
I would say you can, but since you're trying to write it for a class, you have to write how you would do it if you were in the position to be able to do it.  Don't worry about the subject matter.
No, I'm not. I'm writing this for a class I'm TAing for. I am just too excited to write a story idea and not take it. I think I'll just write something up on the fly. I'd like to get on some new stories soon.
This is a great story for your prompt, but if you're not doing a story about how it could be done, it'll certainly *look* like that's what you're trying to do.    You might want to make the title slightly more interesting as well, in case someone finds the story and can't tell that it's actually not about how you think it should be done.  You can always go find examples (that work) to help you with your writing.
Good idea, thank you. It was more about the story itself as a whole and how it would play out in practice. Not so much about the actual story.
Exactly what I was trying to say.    But yeah, no need to go for it.  If you are enjoying it, it's probably fine.  Also, check out the story about how it needs to be done, and maybe try to be more clever in the story itself, not just on the title.
