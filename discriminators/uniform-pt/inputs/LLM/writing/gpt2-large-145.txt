RULES FOR A SUCCOLIDATING QUESTER:

1. Please do NOT start a new story if you already have one started. If you change the setting (e.g., changing to the planet Venus) you will need to get permission from the author of the previous story.

2. If your story is going to get too long, create a link at the bottom of your post to one of my other stories here. (Please also keep the link to your original story a secret - any readers who see your story will need to click on its icon in order to continue with the story.)

3. All posting will be anonymous unless said author gives permission.

4. Each link must be signed with a clickable link back to the author. If a link does not have a link back it is fair game and will be removed.

5. Posts must follow the template provided and no spam (including quotes, links, etc.) will be tolerated.

6. Authors/writers are encouraged to submit the latest work of authors/writers they love!


Thank you, and the best wishes of all.


(I don't allow reposts without previous approval)

I have this story, but it started as a short story! I need help updating it! Please let me know your email addresses!


Thanks and sorry for the delay, my work is very slow.


Thank You,

-Jedi Jabbithaw
