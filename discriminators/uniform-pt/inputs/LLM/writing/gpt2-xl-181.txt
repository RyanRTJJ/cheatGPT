There's a reason why one of our most popular images on the site is this:

When all the cool kids are doing it.

If you would like to post an image on the sub, please submit it through the submission page with your reddit username in the title. Also please don't link to the image on other sites (except your own). We appreciate it when users contribute to the site but you have to give credit.

There are some strict rules set in place here as well that we must follow. Here are the top four:

1) Do not repost/post the same picture.

2) Do not post a picture on a related subreddit (if applicable).

3) Do not post personal information.

4) No porn.

As for what is and isn't allowed on the sub?

There is no specific rule that dictates what is or isn't allowed. We have a lot of subreddits and as a collective that can get a little messy. We like to have discussions on a given subject and try not to change the rules based on outside factors. We would say that only two rules are necessary that are important and they are:

Post pictures with real people (as opposed to stock images or memes with a certain theme)

Do not spam the comments or post self-promotion

Don't be a dick (don't post people's personal information or try to start flame wars with users and post links to the site that violate these rules)

We do not censor reddit submissions and expect the same quality of content on the sub. However, if you're going to upload something that's inappropriate or otherwise offensive, please notify the moderators and we will ask you not to post a picture of you holding a bloody human head until you remove it or a different picture for your post.
