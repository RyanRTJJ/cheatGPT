 If you are an early adoptee, you may be able to find those memories that you have, at a later stage in your life and you will soon be able to make that same connection with the person you chose.  I have seen some postdoctoral researchers show significant power to change the image, and I believe others have demonstrated it in other experiments.  This experiment shows a novel means and a new way to take full advantage of it.
It all depends on the quality of the picture, or the color of the text.  Many of the pictures taken will have dark and white backgrounds so there is some contrast in content over time.  For such circumstances you should have something that can accurately reproduce those types of images with the desired consistency.  But what if the color is completely different than the background, or do you try to mimic the background, rather than creating a complete image instead.   My experience is that if you put a blue on the picture, you can't do anything with what the background has to do with it and that's pretty much a wasted time. But if that blue is a real gradient of text, then this has the same effect as using a single gradient.  If you're using colors that vary greatly from one location to another, then you have to try and recreate the original color pattern in an exact manner.
While the results on these experiments are remarkable from one project to the next, I had to learn a lot about social media from other researchers because of what they taught me about learning from others.
How to create and change the shape and color of your images based on different contexts in your life, or even of people on the same page?
This experiment was done in a time of increasing social inequality and the growing importance of color-blindness in media.  The researchers also used Facebook to communicate their data about the color of Facebook shares in their experiments. So it was great to see how they tried to learn from other researchers.  But what if the picture and background were completely different? Well, I haven't read
