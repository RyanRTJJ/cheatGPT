_______________________________ _______________________________ _____________________ _______________________________ ______________________ I found this prompt on pinterest, and I think its pretty amazing that there are still people out there trying to find their way, and there are so many people who still do not know about this amazing new invention.... which the inventor says he never wanted it to happen... and he was right too.... so the story is about a man who has finally decided to give this invention a chance.... and its amazing, and its pretty sad but at least it brought back the old times when we used to be able to trust each other and there was a place called the internet.... and maybe one day we'll be able to talk to each other and understand who we are instead of hating for the things we do wrong to each other....

In a small town, in a run-down farm house. A tired, tired man sits on the couch, his head hung low. He’s done with this world, he can’t do anything anymore, he’s tried everything and he’s been trying for years. He just wants out, escape, any kind of relief. But there’s no way out of here. No way back.

He is listening to his radio, to BBC. He is trying to find out what just happened in France, and what’s the deal with this place. It is his home, he has lived there for more than ten years, with his wife and son… But they all left a long time ago. Nobody knows where they are now.

The man gets up, goes over to the window, opens it and watches. He just got on his knees, and is praying. Please just let me go, just let me be free. But no, no, they won’t let him… he will be dead before he gets anywhere. Death would be better than what he’s been through in the past years. But he is not ready to accept his fate. He has a plan.
