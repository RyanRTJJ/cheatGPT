 You take your choice of a single story. Which ones? What's your favourite? If you have no favorites, what are your favourite books? When can my favorite readers come to me or mail me? When (if) they can get in touch, and if they're willing to take my book instead? All free online download, free with no charge.
And so all for free here on TBS!
I have some suggestions for those of you who want to read for free on TBS as well as print from a variety of sources.  And if I can reach you, I'll add a link in the comments if you'd like to be notified when I publish something new (with the promise that, if I do, you'd be the first to see it!) You will get instant emails when that happens for sure! But for now, just leave me a comment about your favourite book or article and get in touch!  Or a quick message about new stories on TBS so I can share with you whatever I find worthy of your attention! Thanks again all for your continued support of TBS and my work on other places! *  UPDATE* This time I added several new stories to this list for those of you that just want to read them, so that when it hits me they will start to appear for free. I will post them whenever it arrives, with the first part of the story below and the final story below. All of these are available for download on the Internet here, so they will be free for everyone of you who is in touch!

Here is what I did to add
