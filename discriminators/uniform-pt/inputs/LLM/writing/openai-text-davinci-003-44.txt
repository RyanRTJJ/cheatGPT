Katie had been on the local bus since her morning classes ended. It was a hot, humid day and she was exhausted from the long ride, but she still had to transfer to take another bus out of the city. She got off at her stop and waited in the small shelter, but it seemed oddly empty. She shrugged it off; maybe not many people rode this particular route.

Just then, a group of people approached. From their wild outfits, she assumed they had been drinking, and they were all having an animated conversation. She sighed, wishing they would keep their voices down, but they only got louder and more boisterous. Suddenly, one of them turned to Katie and shouted, "What are you looking at?"

Before she could respond, the group erupted with laughter. Suddenly, a loud, angry voice cut through the noise. It belonged to an old man, who bellowed out for everyone to be quiet. Startled, Katie and the rest of the people stared at him in surprise.

The old man stepped inside the shelter and declared it the "bus stop from hell". He threatened to put a curse on anyone who spoke too much and said if the noise didn't stop, the cursed soul would never find his way home.

That was enough for Katie. She quickly grabbed her bag and ran to the other side of the street, hoping none of the curses would follow her. She was never taking the bus here again!
