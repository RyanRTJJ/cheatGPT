The sun dipping low on the horizon, John walked slowly down the rocky beach, hands in his pockets, the waves crashing against the shore. He takes a deep breath of the salty air and looks out over the vast expanse of water. 

John was reminiscing on all the adventures he and his friends have had over the years. From the camping trips, nights spent telling stories around the campfire, the days spent at the lake fishing, the time they all jumped into the river on a hot summer day and of course, the road trip they had to go on last summer. He grinned to himself when he remembered how scared his friends were of the motorcycles they borrowed from a friend, but in the end, they all had a great time.

As he continued walking down the beach, he came across a driftwood sculpture of a motorcycle, a reminder of that wild summer. He smiled, realizing that despite the good times and bad, they had made it through. That's when he said the words, "We've had a hell of a run".

John stared out at the ocean one last time before heading home, feeling grateful for all of the memories they made throughout the years. He was happy that he was able to have shared these experiences with his friends and wouldn't trade them for the world. 

Though the memories of their childhood adventures might eventually fade, John smiled, knowing that they have had a hell of a run.
