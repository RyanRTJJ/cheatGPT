The years had been a whirlwind since I was elected President of the United States. I had done my best to meet the expectations of the American people, but I was growing weary after the long hours and difficult decisions.

One day, I was exploring the Oval Office, and I discovered something I hadn't expected - a big red button tucked away in the corner of my desk. I asked my predecessor about it, but he said it had been there for decades – since before Kennedy's time – and that the secret of what it did was long forgotten.

I was naturally curious, but I couldn't bring myself to push the button. What if I jeopardized national security or caused irreparable harm? I consulted advisors and considered my options, but I just couldn't make a decision.

The button continued to haunt me, until one day, after a particularly tough day, I finally gave in to the impulse and pushed the button.

Suddenly a brilliant light filled the room and I was surrounded by a vision of Kennedy, who thanked me for taking a risk and finally unlocking the secret of the button.

In his hands he held a document, which he handed to me. I opened the document and read its contents: It was a plan for the United States to become a leader in medical research and development, a plan Kennedy had been drafting when he was assassinated.

I was astounded and asked how this document had been hidden away in my desk. Kennedy replied that it was his way of leaving a legacy, his gift to the world, tucked away and waiting to be unlocked.

As the vision faded, I knew that, through my courage and risk-taking, I had made history.
