 But as you explore, you come to realize that you are being led from the wrong land. Your world continues to bleed blood into each other, the only things left to you are your home, your family, and yours. How important that is is not revealed to you, as you may feel like you are watching your own body burn. The world that you know now must be abandoned. What would have been the outcome if not for the help of the humans, would be less clear.  For it is that moment in time when the only things left will take hold. In its very essence, this is just the beginning, no matter what happens. The only way to save yourself from this is to accept it as a permanent part of what is good for the human race.
This, like the final act or the ending of an entire play, is not easy. The game features six different endings -- death, life, hope and pain -- while not necessarily fully realized by each player.  Each ending plays a role, and its themes have evolved, perhaps slightly.  The beginning has a simple theme: "Oh, what a horrible future you'll have!" This could be an example of a good ending, but it could also be the beginning of another; we are on the same side, and our world is going to become something it will never be. We're not ready already, yet our futures will be forever changed.
At times, we're given conflicting feelings about this end of life.  We think we know what this future will be, but our choices also can be changed. What if we were to die a thousand years later? What if our body had been ripped apart with only the smallest amount of pain,
