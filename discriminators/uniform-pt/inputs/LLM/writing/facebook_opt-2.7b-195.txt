 It doesn't matter who they are or what they were, but I want to know about it. What happens? Who learns? Do humans understand?  Just a thought...
Hmmm. Interesting, but I dunno how that story would end... It's good if I ever get back into writing that world a decent story for you to read! :)  Thanks for the response!
There's lots of stuff that you could try to explore:  The power of the gods in their second life  The power of the demons in their second life  The conflict between the gods and the demons  Or try an origin story for the gods and demon s. "How did they all get up there and why?"
Or more, how they got up there and why did gods and demons end up fighting. I kinda know the origin story on that as i read abt it and I need to write the rest of the story.
That can go many ways, for example: What's it about? What sets them apart, why do they fight?  Could be very interesting, I hope you do it!
Yeah, could be, thanks! I need to find a way to make it not boring after all...
> I need to find a way to make it not boring after all  Don't get me wrong, it could be a very interesting story: just need a little work on the end and possibly the premise... How are you going to end it? And how are you setting it so it's set a long time after the main story ends? That may be a good starting point to work on your story.
I'll try to do that next week! Thanks for your help :)
No worries... Glad I could help, and I look forward to reading your story :)
Thank you! I really hope I don't disappoint! :P
Never! Good luck!
