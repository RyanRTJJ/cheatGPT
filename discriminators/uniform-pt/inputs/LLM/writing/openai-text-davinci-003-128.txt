I sauntered into the bar with the biggest scowl on my face. I had the feeling I'd just had the worst day of anyone, ever, in the entire history of mankind. As I made my way to the others, my lie was detected almost immediately by a phone app that I had installed for this very purpose.

After looking it up, I could see that the app agreed that my statement was indeed true.

It had been a day from hell. It all started when I had been running late for an important meeting. I was so preoccupied that I had absentmindedly left my briefcase behind. When I arrived at the meeting, I was embarrassed to realise that I was unprepared. It didn't help that the person I was meant to be meeting was already incredibly annoyed with me.

The day continued to spiral downwards from there. I got stuck in traffic on the way home, only to find out when I arrived that our house was being fumigated. To top it all off, I hadn't eaten all day and ended up eating some takeaway in my car outside the now fumigated house.

My friends stood there in shock. Nobody could quite comprehend how one day could be quite so bad. I let out a deep sigh before raising my glass in the air in silent toast to the worst day in the history of mankind. After all this, I was ready for a stiff drink.
