Lily stared at her wrist in disbelief. It was impossible. Slowly, her hand traced the intricate design on her skin that wasn't there the day before. There was no mistaking it; it was the same tattoo that had been inked onto her best friend's ankle since the day they were born. But how could it be on her wrist? Her best friend was alive and sitting right next to her.

Suddenly, some inexplicable force drew her gaze to the clock. There it was-- the precise time her friend had nearly been killed in a racing accident the day before. That was when the mysterious tattoo had been transferred to her wrist without any explanation.

Lily had heard the stories of how people's tattoos were connected to tragedy. She had always thought they were nothing more than superstitions, but this was too much to explain away. This was real, and it was happening to her.

Although her friend had survived the accident, Lily was overwhelmed with guilt and despair. She had been the one driving the car, and if she had been paying more attention to the road instead of her phone, this could have been avoided. And now, the evidence of her negligence was printed on her skin for everyone to see.

Her heart sank even deeper with the realization that she would never be able to escape the crushing guilt of what she had done. No matter what else she accomplished or how many people she helped, this would always be a reminder of her mistake.

But her friend seemed to understand, because she only smiled sadly and said, "Don't worry, Lily. I'm here for you, with my tattoo now on you for eternity."
