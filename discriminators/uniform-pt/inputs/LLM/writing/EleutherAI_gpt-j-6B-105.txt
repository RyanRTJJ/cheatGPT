On a beautiful day, a young girl, named "Fern" is sailing her boat, the _Sidney L_, with her best friend "Miggy." Miggy is about her age, but is quite a bit shorter than Fern. All she has is a telescope named "Duck," a camera, and an old book of sea stories. They are almost out in the middle of the ocean, about three miles south of a small lighthouse, one that no one has ever gone near before. "Duck's" glass is broken and they are heading home soon. Fern is excited because Miggy has brought her a few of her grandmother's seashells as a birthday gift.
