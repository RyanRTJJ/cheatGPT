 Then we created "color" versions of the days.  Why does the world look different today? In order to have a better understanding of color differences, I set up my computer to display color photographs taken in daylight, so I can analyze them and learn more about color differences between day and night. So, you might like to take some photos of various colors. The more photos you take, the more detailed the color, the more accurate information gets. Now, you can compare your photos in your favorite photo-editing software of your choice. However, before taking any photos that you like let's take a few days to make sure everything is right. I set my photo processor to the same color as the photo. After taking the photos I need to take a few tests.  If they come out correctly, the images are color correct. If the photos don't come out with enough resolution, take another photo. I used my Mac to take the photos in daylight. If I wanted to put my computer's color test onto a computer monitor,  I would have to sit on it and look at all of my pictures at once, much the same way you take a test that requires you to type the numbers and pictures of the computer to see what they look like. The test I used came from Wikipedia, but any website will probably have one for your specific needs.  I could also just try to get the color images taken in the same location where they actually were taken. If they weren't accurate, I couldn't even expect to see the colors in the color photos. So, I took a color photograph and used my "standard color" settings.  That's what I set. On the second test I could see the color in the photos, but there was a small difference that I wasn't able to reproduce by hand. Now the pictures, again took from the computers, were still accurate in
