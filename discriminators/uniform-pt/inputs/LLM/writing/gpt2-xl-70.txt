_____________________ For those who'd like to contribute: 1. Don't ask for more than you need to complete a story 2. Keep the plot details up to date as much as possible 3. Write in English, or another language where you're comfortable 4. Create a story you'll be proud of 5.

Make it something that you enjoy! 14. I'll give you the credit for all your work, but if you decide not to use my name, a
