 This was the first time that Apple had asked me to try out a new phone. One time I saw it in a retail store, and the other time I used to watch from the comfort of my car.  Now, there have been other smartwatch releases since then, but this one feels like the most important update. It's faster. It goes from 0 to 60ms per second.  It's even faster than my usual 30ms every minute commute.  I've also installed it on a smartwatch and am amazed at how fast it's gotten.  It took about an hour to load it up and a minute to reboot it. This change made the phone faster and faster in about 3 minutes, which is pretty good time consuming for a small phone like this. I have a new version of it available for $199, which is more expensive so it's still on sale for $1,844. I already have the camera and battery at my disposal because once again, the iPhone 6 is the only one on the market, which is another reason the iPhone 6 Plus still hasn't caught on.  And if you're interested in something new and unusual, I'd recommend checking out my e-book, The Case For the iPhone. It's a short, straightforward, and effective book for iPhone owners. You can order your copy for only $15, buy it here.  If you're looking for quality, simple, and practical advice on a product that you already own, this is your book.  I can't wait to go back and pick it up.  The iPhone 6 is really good. It has a lot to offer and I have two other big reasons for wanting to buy this.  The first is simply what it promises, and the second is how much it's available.  I'm writing with my personal experience, so you should really pick this one up. Let me know your thoughts in the comments.  [Via PhoneGolf]
