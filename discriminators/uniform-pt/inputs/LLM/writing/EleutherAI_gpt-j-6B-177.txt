When you've written your story, you'll need to decide whether this sentence is important in your story or not. If it's important for your story, you don't need to include it in the story itself: You can simply have a character say or do this sentence somewhere in the conversation. But if you don't have to include it in the story itself, you don't need it to begin or end its narration. In this case, it's good to have the sentence somewhere in the story to give a little more information/context to the reader. If you decide it's important, write it here:

...
And yet, the city remained - the one thing that didn't change in the time that I lived there. The sun rises and the sun sets on that city every day without pause. This is its destiny, its fate. And it seems to me that that city, more than any other city I have visited on this Earth, is the most beautiful. 

I hope you find it helpful.

 I saw this sentence in a story that I read on Worldbuilding: A Place Of Wonder - it inspired me to ask its author how she felt about it and what inspired her. It also reminded me of a story we discussed in my class about the city of the dead in Greek Mythology, "The Great City of the Silent". It reminds me of this story, perhaps you can use it sometime as well.

This is a kind of "end of story teaser", if you will, in that, while there is some kind of closure to the reader about what happened at the end of the story, there's also something left unanswered about what has happened at the beginning of the story as well.  It gives you a bit of insight into what happened in the story (something very important to be aware of in any short story), and yet still allows you to "look out the window" at the world beyond the book's pages, without necessarily giving a huge blow to your own
