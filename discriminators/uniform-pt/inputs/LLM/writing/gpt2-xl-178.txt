Â Your new superpower isn't very well known, but you can make anything go away. Your power can be used to turn people away, make people forget that they were with you, or any number of other uses. You have a good working knowledge of this power. You also do not have a very good memory though... When you first learned about your power, a stranger who had an office in a similar building where you used to work told you that there were people that were too far in love for this to work.
