It was a day like any other when the world faced something truly extraordinary: every single person suddenly and inexplicably forgot how to read. People didn't understand what was happening, or whyâ€”one moment they could read and the next they couldn't make sense of any written words, no matter how simple they were.

Global panic ensued as the news spread, along with a great deal of confusion. Schools had to close, as teachers and students alike suddenly found themselves unable to read. Government offices quickly became chaotic as workers scrambled to find solutions. Even hospitals were affected, as all medical records and instructions became illegible.

The world went into a sort of shock as people began to realize the enormity of what had just occurred. Soon enough, various organizations and businesses were organizing emergency summits in the hope of finding a solution.

But no matter what was tried, no progress seemed to be made. Eventually, it became clear that this was an unprecedented event; a phenomenon that no one had ever encountered before. There were no answers.

In the months and years that followed, the world slowly adjusted to this new normal. People adapted, learning to communicate and interact in different ways. Despite the hardship and confusion they faced, they still managed to go on and make do.

It was a difficult time, but eventually people remembered how to read and write. It took a great deal of patience, effort and hard work, but in time, the world slowly regained its connection to reading and writing, and things slowly began to move forward.

Though it was never fully understood why every single person in the world suddenly forgot how to read, it will forever remain a mystery of the ages.
