My Dearest [Name],

I know I haven't been the best mother in the past and I feel that I owe you this letter to explain why I had to take the drastic step of disowning you. I know that this must be a difficult time for you and it breaks my heart to have to tell you this, but I believe that you need to learn from every mistake you make.

What you did was wrong. You hurt your family and broke our trust. Your actions damaged our reputation and put us in a very difficult position. I know that you regret it and I understand that, but what is done is done, and we must all face the consequences of our actions.

It was not an easy decision to disown you, but it had to be done. I wanted to give you a chance to redeem yourself, to prove that you were still the same daughter I once knew and loved. But you failed to meet our expectations and your choices opened a wound too deep to heal.

Please understand that this is not a punishment, but a necessary consequence of your decisions. I love you and will always remember you, but right now I must focus on healing both our families. I hope that one day you can forgive me and understand why this had to be done.

With love and regret,

[Your Mother]
