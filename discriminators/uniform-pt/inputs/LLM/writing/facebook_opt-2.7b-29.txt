 The song you heard was “T-Pain”. You were hypnotised by the voice. You were hypnotised.
I'm dead. Thanks for reminding me about that song.
You know the song? Well, I’ve added it to my ‘to-do’ music collection. Thank you for that.
I thought you were joking about it being from TMNT. I was like "wait, what cartoon?" before I realized what I was hearing.
To be honest, I had no idea this was from TMNT. It doesn’t surprise me to learn it’s on toonami though. I was not aware of the music though. That’s awesome.
Yeah. I don't know that its exactly right for the show, but it works for the story. Especially with the story of your girlfriend. But I really don't know why I was thinking of cartoons, especially cartoons I had never heard of. Sorry for bringing that up.
No need to apologise. I appreciate you sharing that with me so that I can listen to it now.
For sure. It's a good song. Don't think I've even heard it before. Kinda surprised that I found it. But no worries.
I think it’s really good and very catchy. You should listen to it. You haven’t seen it recently so the nostalgia won’t hurt you, but I’d say it’s pretty good to listen to now.
I feel like I listen to this song once a week lately. Kinda cool.
I think it’s even better than this. Just try it out, it’s free for all of us. No harm no foul.
I agree, especially since it’s on the internet. It’s free and it’s yours. Enjoy.
