 I was once running an "all-out" Mage character. I just focused on getting maximum INT, while ignoring everything else. It was an interesting experience.
My PCs were running through a level 3 dungeon so I'm going to try out a magic based play through with a mage character and see how it goes. I already told the GM I want to do a play through of Skyrim so he suggested Skyrim: The Great Mage.
It's a great world for a one-shot mage character! You could just focus on enchanting and restoration or conjuration, and maybe do the College of Winterhold (or whatever it is, I had several characters running around in that game).   My all-mage character ended up in the College of Winterhold. It's a cool town, though it's a bit boring as a place to hang out.
I ended up playing in Solstheim with a mage character. It was a blast and the character was actually rather powerful despite only have access to a single magic skill tree. At one point he had a 100% chance of healing himself without using potions :D. I even managed to get an epic piece of gear with a shield spell bonus. It was pretty awesome. Skyrim was a blast with a mage character.
Oh, it's very possible to play one! The College of Winterhold has a few spells that are pretty powerful, not to mention they're a great place for a mage who wants to learn more about the lore. If you're running the College's questline, it's a lot of fun.
Do the College's quests actually teach anything?
I would say no. It's a good way to gain some experience, but it's not an especially interesting story unless you're interested in a major guild member who dies, or want a good education in magic (though the College of Winterhold offers very useful perks otherwise).
