 It begins on Friday, July 5...and has been through the years. But that doesn't mean Sunday, July 10 and Monday, July 11 in Hawaii. If you're a fan of Pacific Rim, you might be interested in the next installment. The first five series of the series are scheduled to air on Tuesday, July 19.  What's more, Pacific Rim 3: The Return of the Jedi will mark the first time the series has been renewed to another season. There's also the last series of the series with two live-action episodes.   The last series with four new episodes aired: 2006's Battlestar Galactica, 2014's Transformers, and 2015's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. So, if you're not into Pacific Rim, you might just be interested in season five.
The story begins in Hawaii, where it's called the "Apex World" by locals called Zetes to call their own. As a result, they've been waging war on the islands, seeking refuge, and sometimes conquest. The original cast includes:  Rene D'Amato, David Arquette, Colin Firth
Mark Rylance, Kate Mosier, Peter Farrell
Robert B. Jordan, Adam Bauel, Mark Doyle
And finally, we have Rene and her old companion, the villain. Rene's former boyfriend Bobo, who doesn't share the same hatred for planet Earth as Rene, is being used as a guinea pig for aliens to try and kill him. With a few different options, these different sides will decide when the guinea pigs go free with all their might.
For starters, when the alien ship that the aliens have hired to destroy Earth returns, Bobo and Rene will have to find the planet, save the life of Rene and his daughter, and rescue their ship from being overrun with aliens. In exchange, they are given special powers, like telepathy, to make their lives easier and faster. Rene isn't going anywhere! 
This isn't just one of the weirdos
