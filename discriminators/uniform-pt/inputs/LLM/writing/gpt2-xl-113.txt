____________________________ Here's the story: The year is 2114, and New York City has been transformed into an infested city. Every night, a new victim wakes up. All of them die within 30 minutes from a contagious disease called virofaunalism. There are two ways to live in this city. If you want, you can stay in the shadows and carry out your murderous impulses. Or you can move out of the shadows and join those who have embraced the light. You find the choice to be difficult. So you're thinking: "What about the light? I am going to help people." You look for a job, and you find one in the security force. However, there are two catches: first, you can only work for four hours a day and two nights a week, and second, you must never tell anyone that you're a security guard. You take the job, and the first night you sleep in a safe location. The next day is hard, but after that you begin to find people that you believe are your friends. A woman named Molly who is dying of the virofaunal disease. A guy named Andrew who is about to have a heart attack and is trying to help this guy named Matt. This is your first week in New York, and by now you're pretty good at your job. That is until Molly dies of the disease. And now you have something to live for. ____________________________ To submit a story for my prompt line: [ SWF ] [SWF] "At first it was shocking, but then it became normal", is about the man who decides to change the world.  _____________________________ [CW] Is this one you've written?
