 That leads to  the same thing.
2. Get the message (and then a sentence) that you never said.  You're not going to write a letter to people right now because you didn't do a proper review.  When you do, you're missing the point of what you're about to say.  And if you do the right thing and say "No" twice, the email will get through.
3. Get a full sentence.  The more words you keep on the cover of the letter, the better.  The more information you keep when you write your letter, the greater the chance of catching that letter.
In this example, you've seen a copy of the original letter.  You also saw the full sentence.  If you get a copy later on, it can be more readable, so be prepared. When you write a letter, put whatever you were trying to say in the beginning.  If you want to save up to two hours, do it twice. Make it two hours in advance, or one a day (you'll still have to write at weekends, right?).
4. A short excerpt (a little too short, I think, I'll just say) on the best practices that your email should include.  Take one of these to get a sense of when it's time to take it off the screen.  As always, try to quote what you wrote up to this letter.  Don't just get your copy of the original and you'll miss out on something.  And remember to back up the letter well before it was sent out.
5. Avoid emails that are too complicated to wrap an essay about with a couple words about your personal needs. (You're only doing this to get a better understanding of your personal life, and it's an obvious way of doing it.)
Remember to include any information you feel is critical of your personal life.  For this reason, I suggest reading The Great American Selfhelp Book, including one from Richard St. Huldai, who is also a major
