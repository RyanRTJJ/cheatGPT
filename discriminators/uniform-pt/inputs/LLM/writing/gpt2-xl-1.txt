_______________________________________________________ *The characters for this story are based on my own experiences and perceptions. Any resemblance to actual people exists purely because of the author's name/voice. Additionally, any names used as the primary character in this story are either my own creation/suggestion or simply based loosely on my own experiences. * I only have access/writing permission to do so for one story, and that one story is my primary focus. So, a lot of this will be new to you. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ *The following text is strictly for the purpose of describing the type of horror genre horror/fantasy that this story deals with. I have nothing against this genre of writing, and I enjoy writing/contributing to it. However, it's far from my main focus and I cannot express myself well in some places where it has an actual focus. *There are certain things I'd like you to not just take for granted as fact because the author says so, or because I've seen other people doing it, etc. And it goes without saying that I would not suggest trying to imitate these behaviors. But I want to mention a few things here because there are certain things mentioned in the beginning of the story that a lot of you might notice with some of these things or know already but because of that, they might be a bit out of place to you. *Also, some things said in this story might sound pretty out there. They might sound crazy. So I try to be really careful with certain details. These are just some of the things I would suggest to you not just to try it out but to be more conscious of, too. So, while you probably won't have any problems with any of these things, it might serve you to take them into account if you're like me. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ *As to the story as a
