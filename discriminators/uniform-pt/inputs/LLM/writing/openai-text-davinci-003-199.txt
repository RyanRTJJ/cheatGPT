I remember it like it was just yesterday... the sun was high in the sky when I heard the first distant vibrations. Instantly my heart raced, my fur bristled and I froze in fear. I quickly scanned the horizon and there it was: my predator.

Human hunters, chasing me with their relentless stamina. My only hope was to keep running and hope that my strength held out for long enough for me to find safety. I sprinted at full speed, desperate to find safety from the relentless pursuit from my predator.

But it was no use. The relentless chase continued and they slowly but surely closed in on me. My eyes filled with tears as I realized my fate was sealed.

Years have now passed and still, I often have nightmares of the pursuers. It slowly begins as a distant rumble, slowly becoming louder and more intense until I am finally awake. I have grown older and wiser in this time, but that terror still wells up inside me every time I think back to that day.

Humans have evolved, they no longer hunt this way, but the memory of that experience will never leave me. I am forever changed by the experience, and I will never forget the feeling of absolute terror that coursed through my veins that fateful day.
