Rachel was the kind of girl who loved horror movies. She had seen so many of them, she prided herself in being able to guess the twist ending. So when she heard that M. Shyamalan was making a new movie, she was ecstatic.

She was determined to be the first one to see it. She waited outside the theater for hours, until the first showing. But when she finally got inside, something strange happened. The room went dark, and a voice said, "You've been chosen to be the first one to witness the twist ending of this movie."

Rachel was nervous, but also excited beyond belief. She watched the movie, and sure enough, there was a twist. It was something she had never seen before, and it blew her mind. She was amazed at Shyamalan's genius.

She couldn't believe that she was the one who had been chosen for this special task. She wanted to tell everyone about it, but something held her back. It felt like it was a special secret that only she knew. It gave her a feeling of power and privilege.

In the end, it didn't matter if anyone else knew or not. Rachel had experienced something unique, something only she knew. That made the experience even sweeter, and gave her a newfound respect for M. Shyamalan.
