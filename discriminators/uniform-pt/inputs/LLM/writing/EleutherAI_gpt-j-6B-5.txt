The student's motivation letter

Dear Professor Smith,

I have received your offer to have me apply for the Graduate Research Assistantship position. Before I apply, I wanted to come to your office for a while and talk to you about how the Graduate Research Assistantship will fit into my plans for furthering my education.

My background in mathematics has prepared me well to take part, for the first year, in your program. I would like to pursue a career after graduate school that will involve research in mathematics, and I am confident that your program would be a good way for me to prepare myself for that career.

While attending MIT, I will be required to fulfill the usual obligations for Graduate Studies students, such as participation in some undergraduate teaching in addition to research. However, since I am still a student in Massachusetts, I have been told that my responsibilities here are not that heavy, and it would be a waste of my time to be teaching in the community at the same time as I am working towards my doctorate. Although I want to give MIT full consideration, I don’t want to be tied down to the institution in Massachusetts for too long. Because of the restrictions on my financial aid, I do not know for sure yet how well my current college will support me, so I need to make my plans as soon as possible. I realize that you are not obligated to give me an RA position, but I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you about my situation, and whatever advice you have to offer.

Thank you for your time,

Tim Gorman

PS. I would also like to apologize for my tardiness to your office today. My train was cancelled and I didn’t get here until 11:45.

PPS. I have attached a sample of some of my recent research.
1.) The paper shows that 2 × 5 = 12 _____(a) true, (b) false.

3.) (3^3/2)
