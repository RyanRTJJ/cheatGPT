  Edit: I didn't use the correct tense as suggested by /r/space. I will leave that typo though, cause it's better than the idea of the original commenter.
Yeah. That's also a fantastic idea. Thanks!
I like the idea but I think it's better if you try to fit that into another prompt. If you can come up with a sci-fi premise for what happens when the Earth and the Moon are aligned.
That might help with the problem with time dilation. Because I still think the Earth would have a view to it that would be able to change over time. But I think that would be more interesting than the original idea.
True. It's not a permanent view. Your characters would grow tired of it.    I would try to come up with a story that would show that this could have an effect on a civilization. For example, it could be that they do a ritual or a kind of clock counting down towards something. When they have counted down to the point where they are tidally locked, the clock stops and they must come up with solutions to their problems quickly with no time for a normal period of time to pass.
So it would be an event that changes the culture of the society? For example, they are counting down to a revolution or something in their society? I like that, thank you very much!
Yep.
Alright, thank you very much! You have been very helpful! :)
No problem. If you decide to go down this road, please update me with your finished draft. I would love to see it.
I definitely will! I definitely will. Do you have a website or anything like that? Would you be able to use something like Dropbox?
I only have
