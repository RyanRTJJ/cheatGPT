 The room you stand in seems to be as big as the entire world, yet you are locked in a box with no escape.
There is no sense of where you are. You only know where you stood at one time, by the way the room looks now. There is no window through which you can see anything. However, as you move around, you feel the vibrations of the room, like the world is passing by. Your hands and feet feel heavy, and time seems to pass slowly for you. You are in no hurry to wake up. As you stand there you feel numb, like you are dreaming, however you know it is very real.

Do NOT add anything after that. You write nothing else to this. This whole story is the start of the whole story.

A:

This is an experimental setting of the famous AIs in your head story

 "If you were the AI and there was an AI that wanted to kill you, where would you go?"
Answer: Nowhere. There is no way to escape. (and the AI wouldn't stop until it's stopped)

This also can apply in any sort of "dream" that we can't quite wake up from in real life, because you are aware of the fact that you're not really in sleep.

 A person who knows and accepts this fact, and thinks he is dreaming. (I think the idea is that the conscious part, i.e. us, is not really there)

Of course it can be something like in "sleep" when you want to wake up, that kind of thing and don't know what is really going on.

 People being chased by an evil AI and thinking that they are dreaming, but still can try to escape

But maybe I'm just overthinking it, and it's just "a dream", what else can I say?

 A dream is supposed to feel real. You won't know
