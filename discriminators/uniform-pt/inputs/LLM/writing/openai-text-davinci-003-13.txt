Jerred had been traveling for weeks without rest. Through mountain and meadow and valley, he foraged for food and scarce rest until his heart finally called out for a place to rest his weary head. His quest had been one of discovery, one of a journey that seemed never-ending. He had been gifted a powerful amulet of sorts that allowed him to follow a never-ending song, one that seemed to play in the trees and whisper on the wind.

For days, he followed this song, never straying too far from its course no matter how rough the terrain, until the song finally lead him to an opening in the trees. Through river, root, and stone, the distant call of home grew with each step, until finally Jerred emerged in a magnificent and sprawling woodland kingdom, one that could only be described as a paradise of tranquility, beauty, and magic.

For many days, Jerred explored the kingdom, found his way through the cobblestone streets, and learned of its secrets and tales of old. Eventually, he was reunited with his family who had been waiting for his return. Joyfully, he embraced them, content to be reunited with his loved ones, for it was here in this wondrous kingdom that Jerred found his true home.
