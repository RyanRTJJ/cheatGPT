 Then, as a true Redditor, share your find with us.
OP delivers!  >I was able to track down my real life reddit name and address, and I can now safely say I am famous on the internet.  >In case you're wondering, my real name is John Smith and I am not famous on the internet.
>  I am not famous on the Internet.  I am known in my local bar because I was the first to discover this bar's hidden secret on the internet.    But I wasn't famous on the internet yet, but that was because Redditors were the first to find out where that place was here.  On the other hand, my real hometown, I have no clue where it is, maybe someone can link that.
"and that's how I discovered I was famous on the Internet."
This could be the first of many articles about people who are famous on reddit and how they discovered it.
I think these stories would become quite popular. People would probably come up with other interesting and bizarre story lines that would be good enough to make a series out of.
I was going to say a subreddit of this would make an awesome idea for a website, but that would probably cause another reddit circle jerk.   So in short, they would probably be awful.
"Reddit on Reddit" - "We bring you the internet's top stories and comments, delivered daily."
And it would only be the top stories.
So...Reddit?
Oh god. Not this again...  You can have your "top" of the Reddit stories, and leave ours in peace.
What kind of internet do you use?  How do you know I'm not using yours?
