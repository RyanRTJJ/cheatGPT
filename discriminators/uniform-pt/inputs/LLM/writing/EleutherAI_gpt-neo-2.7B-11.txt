In the first part of this story it was a moon...then another moon...a third moon. It was an Earth, and a Moon, it was an Earth, and that first moon was a small moon, a real moon. I would not tell a story about this one for any reason.



Now it's just a little moon. But one day it moves with the Earth and gets larger and larger....and it won't stop and it won't fall towards the Earth and it won't fall away! In the sky it might stop right now, in the sky and be there forever...it's a new moon, a real moon, a new moon.....and then it will not stay the same size or move at the same rate or even keep the same face-to-ground distance with us. So now another world will appear, it will be so close to us that not even close. But we will not know this, and when we pass the other moon it will just disappear in a flash. I just want people to make themselves believe this until they become afraid of the reality of this new moon.

The Earth orbits the sun. So does the Moon. But the Moon orbits Earth more quickly than the Earth does. The Earth and Moon orbit the Sun as an ellipse. This has two implications:

The closer the Moon is to Earth, the faster the Moon orbits the Earth.

The Moon is also a kind of giant gravitational lens.

Lensing is not the same as refraction. We will see the Moon appear smaller as it orbits so far from us.

Refracting is actually a bit hard to explain, because when I try and make a real telescope look in one direction, the telescope does not see one fixed point in the sky. The light just
