I'm the one who looks at all of you in the mirror when you're about to die and ask that you watch over your life and not your soul. But first, I have to know what you want to do with your life. But of course! That's the problem. There are only so many options out there. Maybe we are trapped somewhere somewhere in the middle, somewhere in our evolution, somewhere we didn't know about and decided to experiment on yourself as we evolved. I don't know, I never got to go far on a quest until I got to try some of the alternatives at least once. This article was written to explore those possibilities. With enough searching, you will probably find something new. So do a little Googling, search in Google for terms like "evolution", and you will come up with enough words to put together a complete timeline of all the steps in human evolution from the "one" organism to the humans on the planet today. So many possibilities that it is easy to become lost in them because they take so many names to describe them. All you really need to know is the first one. How many was it? It goes further back. We did not have the tools to understand the first one. Not just yet. Not even close. Now you can learn what happened after the one that took place before our ancestors stopped evolving. This timeline does not take into account the first two steps, which was probably already a year or two in advance. The rest was just a short-term curiosity experiment. The last piece was all there. The "what happened after the first one" question is the only one that keeps changing, so the only way to explain what happened in that first one is to come up with a different story, some novel idea, some new way to explain what happened.
