 What would you pick?
What is a door to eternally happiness?
It would be to have the knowledge of God's plan for you, so you know that you always can trust him to look after you.
So God wants to be my friend?
I think so.  Do you trust him? Or are you too afraid of the future to trust him?
I don't know if I trust God? Should I?
Well if he really exists then he would want you to, right? How is it that you don't trust him as your creator?
I don't know if I do or don't trust him. I trust my mom not to take my future away
Then that's all you need to know. I'm sorry I didn't have any more answers to this question.  Have a good day.
You didn't have to do that. Thanks. You too.
No problem, best wishes to you.
Well I have already changed my name. So good bye.
Have a good day, and goodbye.
Have a good day, too, and thanks again for this.
Well thank you. I'll have a good day too.   We just have to remember to trust.
Trust does not mean to put my fate in your hands. Trust means I can give up all control and you won't be able to take it back. I hope I can do that.
It is so confusing. I guess it just varies from person to person.
You don't have to believe. Belief is a choice. Knowing is not a choice.
What is knowledge? Is it something different from knowledge?
That is a question that may never be answered. That question might never be answered, but that doesn't mean it isn't important. My belief is that knowledge is the essence of spiritual evolution.
How do YOU explain knowledge?
I don't. My belief is that God created the universe, so I have no explanation for everything.
God made everything to exist, and everything already exists.
Does God exist then? How much does he understand
