Annie had always had some strange abilities. She could think of something and it would move. She started practicing it at an early age, finding out what she could and couldn't do. She could move things around as long as they weren't too heavy, like coffee cups, dishes, and books.

At first, Annie thought she had some kind of telekinetic power. But, as time went on and she used her abilities more, she realized that she was actually summoning some kind of entity to do it for her. She could feel a presence in the room when she used the power, and it creeped her out at first.

However, as Annie started using the ability more and more, the entity seemed to get more and more frustrated. It would reluctantly do what she asked it to do, but it was never happy about it. She could sense its annoyance in the air.

Annie started to worry that one day the entity would get so annoyed with her that it would refuse to help her. As if it could sense her worry, the entity seemed to get even more agitated.

One day, the entity snapped. It refused to do anything Annie asked and instead threw the object she had been trying to move across the room. Annie was so shocked that she backed away in fear.

The entity then proceeded to lecture her about how she was taking advantage of its power and how she should start doing things for herself. It explained that, while it was easy and convenient to just summon it up and have it do all the work, it was also draining its energy and causing it to tire out.

The entity told her that if she didn't stop, it would have no choice but to leave her and never come back
