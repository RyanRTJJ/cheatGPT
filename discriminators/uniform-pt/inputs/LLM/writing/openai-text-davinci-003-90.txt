 thought death.

Death had been watching Steve for years. He was a special one, the kind Death had rarely seen in all his time. Where most wilted under his gaze and trembled in fear, Steve laughed in his face and faced his challenges with courage and grace.

Death could sense that Steve was special, and over time he had grown to admire him. But even as death admired Steve, he feared him. So many times he had tried to take his life and each time he failed. Steve seemed to defy all the laws of death - he always persevered, he never gave up, he kept on going no matter how many hardships he faced.

Now Steve was gone, taken away suddenly and without warning. Death was left feeling angry, frustrated and helpless. He could do nothing but brood and sit idly at home, staring at Steve's photograph which he had pinned to his dartboard.

But even as he stared at the picture, he could still feel Steve's presence, as if the photo was still looking back at him and smiling. Death held onto this feeling and reconciled himself to Steve's final act of defiance. He accepted that he had been beaten, and he cherished the lessons he had learnt.
