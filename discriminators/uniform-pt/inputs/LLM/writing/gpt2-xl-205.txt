3) If you're having trouble figuring out what kind of trick question you're asking, just remember to ask a question about how the reader perceives the deception.
Questions about perception should follow in the same vein as the tricks question. Readers will naturally look out for clues like: What does the narrator perceive and how does she see it? How does she explain the apparent inconsistency?
