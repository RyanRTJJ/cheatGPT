 You must save the girl in a dream and wake up with her in real life. Will you dreamt her? Can your dreams be so cruel to you?
Sounds like a great idea. I'll definitely write it up. Thanks!
Thanks! Good luck, have fun.
I should add a disclaimer, your original idea is also quite good. I'm no good at writing. So you would be the real hero here. Not me :)
Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I'm good at writing, but I'm going to put the finishing touches on this one. I've written over 100 flash fics already so we'll see.
Oh really. You write really well then. I would love to see your work.
Alright, I'll try to post links to my work next time. Or at least screenshots.  Thank you! :D
Great! Let me know when you put it up. Looking forward to it. :)
Alright, now that I am in my bedroom, I am going to try and get the pictures up.
Okay, I just had to come back and check on this post. It was posted last night but I didn't see any links/screenshots in your post? Am I missing something? Where can I go to find them?
I had to go to Imgur.  Then I clicked the links. It took me to my story on Imgur.  I'm not sure what the trick was, the site itself is probably confusing. Maybe your browser isn't letting Imgur work.  Not sure, let me look.
The problem was definitely Imgur's site. Thank you so much for your help! And I'll happily post any of your work for review:)
I just finished my writing for now, I have time to read some others, and get this posted!   Thanks for the feedback:)
