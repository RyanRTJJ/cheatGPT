  I'll see you next time!
/r/writingprompt is great for prompt ideas. I posted the same format there a while ago and it just inspired me to do this.   As long as it fits.
I should've been specific and stated it must be a part of the game, which this definitely isn't. Thanks for the recommendation though!
Nah, write a story.
Alright buddy, I appreciate you putting my post on your reddit. But I said specifically, it must be part of the game. This is an idea not a piece of writing.
Writing a story doesn't mean it has to be canon in any way. As long as there is some merit to it, it's yours. Just a suggestion. If you don't like it or it doesn't fit, just delete it. No need to put up a fight about it.
Alright, so it's yours then?
Yeah. Sorry if it seems like I'm being harsh, it was an honest suggestion that didn't come across the way I said it. As long as *you* like it, then it's yours.
I'll take you up on the advice, just send me some links if you'd like.
This person is just gonna try to argue. I'm on mobile, there are none to click on.
Darn, that's stupid.
Yeah man, idk what's with that guy. If you search for "write a story" on r/writingprompt you get posts of people's prompts. I'd advise you to read some of these, to help inspire you.   Good luck :)
Thank you, I'll try that. If you remember my name, PM me and I'll give it a try. In the mean time, I'll continue looking at those that inspire me.  *bows*
Don't worry about it, just delete him and the other guy on the forum if/when you get time.
Alright. Thanks. It's been a long day. I'm going to sleep now. Goodnight!
