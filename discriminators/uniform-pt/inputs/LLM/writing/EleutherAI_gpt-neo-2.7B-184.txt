My friend, who is in a couple of marriages, told me that you got nothing.
My friend who is in a couple of abortions told me that you got everything.

I can't do less. It isn't in my blood, it's not my nature. And there's no way in hell I'd turn against my will to help someone I really wanted to succeed more than anyone out there.

I'm not willing to risk my life for a man who's not right for me. And the bottom line is he doesn't stand a chance at a fair trial.

Well, I've always been the kindest person you'll ever meet. I could just say, "I'm not gonna be the kind of person that helps a person like you who is clearly the most entitled, arrogant, self-centered person to walk the planet."

You know what? Your friend's right, even if he's right to a lesser extent.

You know, I've read in the books a number of times that when you've been married once, you'll know how to be married a second time. And you know what? I'm not so sure about that... Because I really didn't like that first time. It just didn't work for me. And now? Now that we're divorced after 2-1/2 years, I was actually more miserable after it than I was beforehand. A part of it was because he knew I hated him, which put my own feelings on ice, but really I think a HUGE part of it is that I had a child on the way, and there was a little bit of fear that I was going to have a second child, so I was sort of afraid to tell him, I know a lot of women, particularly young mothers, that you'd have kids and they were out there in the world, but my fear was if I did, it wouldn't be with me. And then, of course, he could do whatever he wanted, so I just sat back and waited for him to call.

So with that in
