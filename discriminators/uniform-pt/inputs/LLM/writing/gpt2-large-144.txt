 The scenario might have soldiers that could move, attack, or do lots of different things.  Or the scenario might have a scenario where a squad of soldiers are sent into battle, without any kind of organization and without weapons.   The soldier in question might choose  to be their own character/leader, and have them lead a small force against a larger force.  The soldier would be under their command until the end of the battle (and then they must leave the field).
Writing a quick-start adventure setting:  Give a brief description of a village, possibly without a single character in it. Make one or two key decisions, a list of the choices (one for a main character, the other for a minor character), and how each choice will affect the main character and its goals. Maybe each character has a unique quest, or they can use their combat prowess to help with a specific goal.
I want to play a game designed as a short campaign.
So, in closing, these are the questions my homebrewers asked me over the course of several months of emails and phone calls: Is it useful to me?    Do I really want to play a game about soldiers with weapons?  Did I miss some obvious questions?  Or does a game about soldiers really make a better game?
That's it.  I hope you found this handy.  If you're interested in playing a game of superheroes, you should seriously think about giving it an try.  If you really don't care about getting in a bunch of trouble on the field, then go play the game you're reading.  But if you want to see what it's like to play a superhero game while having a great time while doing it, then play the game you just read.
