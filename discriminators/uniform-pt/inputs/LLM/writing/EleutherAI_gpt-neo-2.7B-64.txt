 
An important city located directly north of the explosion was forced to abandon the town of Alamogordo, a crucial city in the development  of Project HADES, one of America's top-secret, top-drawer nuclear bomb projects.  
Project HADES was based in a town in northwestern New Mexico, and was aimed at developing a nuclear bomb to devastate the Soviet Union, and maybe other countries, as well. The bomb was a huge device about 10 meters high, weighing about 100 tons, and it destroyed every type of chemical explosive the Soviets possessed.
A nuclear detonation could level buildings with less than 10% of that device's mass, which is why New Mexico has been spared.  
However, this little piece of history was overlooked when the first HADES Project was announced. The project was given a name of "Alamo," the town's name. "I like that name," said one historian who was given the contract and briefed on the project. "The Alamogordo bomb will explode here, on the Alamogordo mesa."  He was wrong. After the blast was detonated on July 10, 1945, a huge cloud of dust rose over Alamogordo's streets. The blast sent plumes of black smoke and dirt high into the air. Alamogordo was uninhabited, not even a shell of a town left.  
But it wasn't all lost. What few people managed to salvage were souvenirs and memories.  
It was a few years later, in the 70s, after the Russians had finally defeated the Nazi's, that local history and the history of New Mexico was researched, and some of what survived of the destruction became the basis for a few novels, a few plays, and one entire television show.  
The television show was called ALAMO. The director said that was the name of the bomb, and it was detonated on the Alamogordo mesa, "Alamo" being the name
