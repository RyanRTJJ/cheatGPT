The superhero had been up against his archnemesis, the supervillain, one too many times. Whole cities had been destroyed in their clashes and the superhero was determined to put a stop to this cycle once and for all.

So he tracked the villain to a small town and prepared for the fight of his life. But when he came face-to-face with the supervillain, he was surprised to discover that not a single death had been caused by the villain, and the town was still intact.

Even more strange was that the only building that was damaged after their fight was the local donut shop. It seemed like a strange coincidence, but the superhero knew that it must be the villain's doing.

He finally confronted the villain and demanded to know why he always left the donut shop standing while destroying everything else. It turns out that the villain was a big fan of donuts, and he felt guilty about all the destruction he had caused, so he made sure to spare the donut shop.

The superhero couldn't believe it. Here he was, facing his archnemesis, and not only had he not caused any deaths, but he was kind enough to spare the local donut shop. He knew that he could never truly defeat the supervillain, for he had a heart of gold despite his bad rep.
