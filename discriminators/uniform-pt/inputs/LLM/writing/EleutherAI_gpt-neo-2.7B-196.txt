### About the Creative Team

Each child chooses their favourite quote to bring to the party. This story prompt is being shared with each child in order that they can choose the quote they would like to read.

To be successful, the children need to find their favourite quote (and the most favourite character) and bring a copy of the story to each child to read. Also, each child should write a story based on this prompt (using any of the following words â€“ sorry, they are being replaced with what they have written).

To help inspire the children, we have prepared a list of quotes which will be used throughout the activities.
