 [ no way] [   not thinking] 'What do people really think?'  [   of] [      ] 'Who could possibly buy this?'  [      ]  or 'Oh, my God! Who just bought a 'big ticket' sale?'  [   not thinking] 'What in the world has your heart been turned to?'  This will also allow you to have a better understanding of the different ways that you will feel within an article. For example, you may want a discussion surrounding whether or not to'start' a novel or whether or not you want to 'finish' one. This will provide a broader perspective for your writing. (  You may also wish to create a separate story based around an article that you feel fits neatly into the 'what can you see/how will this fit into the 'whos  of our lives?  (aside from your own perspective of whether your own thoughts)  based on the 'whos  of yours' instead.) Use this topic throughout your story and it will become part of the final product.  (The same thing can be done for something you want to see through later on). A brief example of this will be if you write about a group of people who have been discussing whether or not they should 'live' where they are or should 'die' where they are. Use this topic throughout your story and you will likely experience positive reactions to the conversation. ( The same thing will also be possible if you use this tactic when writing an 'all in out' narrative like 'the family  has to leave or a guy needs a change and is having a difficult family reunion.') Use this topic throughout your story and you will hopefully experience interesting outcomes such as success, successes and success of the characters. See you later. -Kurt ___________ Author's note: If you are interested in
