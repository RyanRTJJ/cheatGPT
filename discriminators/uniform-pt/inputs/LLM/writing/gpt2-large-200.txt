__________________________________________ Welcome to the official contest website. We are pleased to announce the winners of the "Story Writing Contest," and the first five story writers will each win $1000 for writing a story! (Remember! This competition is open to all writers of fiction, no matter if writing for kids or adults.) Each tale should have a main character (a human or fictional character) and one or more supporting characters (usually villains). As the contest is ongoing, feel free to submit more than one entry. Here's the contest rules: A story should be a minimum of 500 words and should tell of a significant event or occurrence in the world.

You must be 16 years old or older to enter the contest.

You have up to six months to write and submit your story, after which we will announce the winners.

The story must be your own original; no story submitted directly via the website by another author will count.

No plagiarism or excessive use of a character's name or likeness or any other similar elements.

We have the right to keep the plot of the story and the plot line of the contest intact until the deadline (we'll even pay for shipping if we determine you used this prize incorrectly).

We will not hold back material in the contest - only after submission.

If we decide that your entry violates the rule above or any other rule, we won't be responsible for any loss of any kind.

If any of the contest rules are held to be invalid, void, or otherwise unenforceable, these rules will remain in effect for the remainder of the contest (including submitting an entry) and you won't receive the prize (our apologies). You may use the word "straw" in your story as often as you like.

The rules in this guide will not apply to stories about cats, aliens, or ghosts or dragons. However, if you are interested in writing a story about a dog, we encourage you to visit our companion website with dog-focused contest tips, tips
