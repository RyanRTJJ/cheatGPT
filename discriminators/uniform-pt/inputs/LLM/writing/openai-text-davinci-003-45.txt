The world had thought it would be like any other day. They were wrong. In what had appeared to be the blink of an eye, the whole of the human populations had found themselves immune from physical injury and sickness. Instead of age and funerals slowly taking years off a persons life, these people found themselves able to live forever, an entire population of immortals.

Everyone except for one person.

In the chaos of the moment, a single person had been overlooked, not having received the same miracle bestowed upon their friends and family. No injury or disease would mark the life of this single human, but time still would. The same aging process still applied, and the body was still subject to the same mortality rate.

This person felt the eyes of the world on them, and they were scared. Everywhere they went strangers whispered rumors, pointing out how they were the anomaly that would ultimately succumb to death, surrounded by an unending cycle of life.

The pressure of being the only mortal was too much for one person to deal with, and so they fled. They sought solace in the darkest corners of the world, and as the years went on, these people slowly slipped into obscurity. But they were never forgotten.

Even as they watched the generations continue on, they were not lost on the people of the world. In the back of everyoneâ€™s mind, the single mortal appeared to serve as a reminder of our own mortality, a reminder that immortality came with a price. A reminder that without death, nothing would have any true meaning. 

And for the single mortal, it became a reminder to live life to the fullest, and remember to cherish every moment because it could pass all too quickly.
