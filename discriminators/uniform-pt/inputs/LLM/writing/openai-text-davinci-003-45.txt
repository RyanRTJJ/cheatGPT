Once upon a time, God appeared before a man and showed him three doors. The man was confused as to what these doors meant, so God spoke. "The first door will lead you to eternal happiness. If you choose this door, you will live in a land of joy for the rest of eternity. The second door will lead you to infinite knowledge. All the secrets of the universe, which are vast and hard to uncover, will be revealed to you. The third door is different. I have never opened it, so I do not know what is inside. Take your time, ponder your choices, and pick one of the doors when you are ready."

The man thought deeply, trying to understand the opportunity he had been presented with. He reasoned that infinite knowledge was a powerful thing and that to be surrounded by eternal happiness would be a dream come true. However, something within him stirred at the mystery behind Door Three. He sensed that it contained something special, and he felt that no matter the risk, it would be worth it to explore this unknown.

So, the man chose Door Three, and God stepped aside so he could open it. When he did, the man was overcome with an overwhelming sense of excitement. Behind the door lay a world filled with unimaginable beauty, thrilling adventures, and vast expanses of untapped potential. The man had unknowingly opened the door to the world of creative exploration, where he could explore his passions freely and develop his own unique perspective of the universe.

The man thanked God for his wisdom and never looked back. From then on, he dedicated himself to uncovering the secrets of the universe and finding joy in the life he had.
