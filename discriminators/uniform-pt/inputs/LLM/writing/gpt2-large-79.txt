 I could tell when the last light bulb went off, but I needed the real thing. So a friend and I spent the night in a warehouse and found some bulbs that look like...well, they looked a lot like the lamp we wanted.  The light bulb wasn't supposed to be used that way, but no good lamp can be left around. (Sorry about that...) So now I have the lamp, and a nice light switch to switch it ON and off. Now I need to figure out how to attach it to something.  (I'm sure you can figure in your mind how to do this.)  I've been having my hard earned money stolen. All I can think about is how I was robbed of the lamp on my very first day as a journalist, and all I can do is try to figure out what it does. So what does the lamp do?  Let me think. Well, it looks like it lightens my room.  I don't know if that's entirely true, but it certainly gives my room a warmer look. In any event, it gives me warm, inviting light, which makes an already nice room more inviting and more inviting. And, well, who am I kidding, it also really makes my bed better.  I may sleep better, but it gives me that bed feeling. If I stay in the room that's lightened, I'm reminded each night that my room is my home.  It's home. With the lamp attached to me (or rather, not attached), my home feels warm and inviting.  It's good that I got a lamp.  Now I don't have to worry too much about the thief, as he won't walk back through the house.  This gives me more peace inside, even if it isn't as much I want as I would like. I could get my lights on too, if I didn't mind leaving lights on. I'll let you know.
