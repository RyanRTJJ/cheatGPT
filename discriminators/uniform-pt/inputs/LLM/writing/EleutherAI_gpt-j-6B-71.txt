### Prompt #4

Read the following passages carefully and then write a story to match it. Tell how well each character fits into the story.

"And now," said the captain (I know he is your friend), "let me tell you what I think of the man who would be a captain."

His voice was clear and ringing as he spoke.

The crew listened in breathless silence. No one would have thought that the sailor's words would have that tone. They did not know the captain. The captain had seemed quiet and gentle during the last voyage, and they had all wondered if they would get the chance to hear him speak.

"To do his work," he said, "that is his duty. There may be a hundred ships off on the seas and all of them will have the duty he has. There may be a thousand sailors to whom the duty will fall. Well, he must take it. He will be responsible for the loss of the ship if he does not. It will be so if he does, just as it will be so if he is not there.

"Every captain is responsible for the safety of those he commands. Nothing they do is right or wrong. It is right if the ship is safe. It is wrong the ship is lost. But if the ship loses the captain, then the whole world will lose everything."
