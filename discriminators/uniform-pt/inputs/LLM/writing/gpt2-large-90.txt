------------- I've finally finished reading the book, The Long Ride home.  I had thought I was going to lose interest after the first few pages, but then I started feeling the same way I did reading Harry Potter.  I don't care about the dragons, or the trolls, or the other children's books.  It's just a book, and it's not like I have anything to compare it to.  It's just plain old good reading. I'm writing my stories now, and they're all in my writing journal.  I'm not even going to try to put them on paper anymore.  I know it's a book, but I can't help it.  It was difficult to write this blog for so long, but now that it's done, I look back at all the books I've read and see the same thing, and it makes me feel like there's nothing wrong with me.  I guess I don't want to feel like there's nothing to talk about. I want to go back and look through this book of mine.  To see that this book is the only thing that has happened in my life. I was having trouble finishing last year, too, but I feel a lot better now, after I finished.  I was reading to prepare for the exams, and I'm reading a different book tonight, and I feel a lot better! The books have a way of making a story real to me.
