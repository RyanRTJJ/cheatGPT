I was so excited to finally have achieved my greatest invention yet. I had been working on an invisibility cloak for months and now it was complete! After completing my invention, my thoughts wandered to the idea of actually testing it out. Who better to test it on then my school crush?

So, I grabbed my cloak, a flashlight, and some snacks, and headed to his house. I was a bit nervous, but I was determined to make this work. I arrived at his home and carefully crept up to his window. I put on my invisibility cloak and suddenly I was gone!

I was amazed at how well it worked as I watched my crush get ready for bed. He seemed so peaceful and unaware of my presence. I could hear his thoughts as I watched him brush his teeth and floss. He talked to himself and I laughed at some of the funny things he said.

After he finished and left his room, I took off my cloak and quickly tucked myself away in the corner. I stayed there, quietly snacking and watching him until he went to sleep.

When morning came I was a bit sad my invisibility adventure was over, but I certainly made some memories. For the next few weeks, I was on cloud nine, dreaming of all the possibilities I could have with my invention!
