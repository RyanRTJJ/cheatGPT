The Omeyians had quietly coexisted with the other races in their galaxy for millennia. They had always been content to remain isolated, allowing other species to explore their lands but never encroaching on their own.

But when their peaceful existence came to an abrupt end, the Omeyians found themselves besieged by a much more aggressive race. Their planets were attacked and their home world was threatened with destruction.

The Omeyians were faced with an impossible dilemma. They had no means to defend themselves against this new enemy and the odds were stacked heavily against them.

It was then that they made a desperate yet calculated gamble. They would send a small group of their people to find the one sentient species in the galaxy even more brutal than their attackers: humans.

The Omeyians asked the humans for aid in exchange for FTL technology. Humans accepted the deal and quickly sent forces to aid the Omeyians.

Together, the humans and Omeyians quickly routed the enemy forces. The Omeyians were saved, their planets restored and their home-world safely defended.

The Omeyians repaid this debt by giving the humans access to the FTL technology they had promised. This allowed humans to explore the universe and eventually build a great interstellar empire.

Though the Omeyians had made a difficult decision and faced incredible adversity, they ultimately saved their home and people. Thanks to the existence of humans and their willingness to help, the Omeyians were able to defy the odds and secure their freedom.
