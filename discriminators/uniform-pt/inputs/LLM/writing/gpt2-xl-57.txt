 on her 11th birthday. What is her response?
How many women does it take to change a lightbulb?
Two, to be exact. (Or maybe 10, depending on how many there are.) 
This is why no woman has ever succeeded. Not even the most beautiful one. She's gone back to looking like her father, a poor old man who had to leave the family. But it goes far beyond that. 
Women have learned what they have to say. 
"That is something I don't understand. You can look in a mirror at yourself, and you want someone else to look in your eyes. But I don't want to change for something I find hard to do. As a man, I can put on a hat. Or play football. As a woman, I feel like I have to be ashamed to wear the clothes I want to wear." 
"Who should be allowed to make our babies? Men, mostly." 
"The world needs men, so men can take care of us!"
"Who should be allowed to be our leader? Men, mostly."
"The world needs men, but that won't happen without some men showing them some leadership." -- (We all have to take some leadership responsibility, even if we're not the main ones!)
"Who should be allowed to hold our passports and our IDs? Men, mostly,"
All of these things are men's and most of them -- or more than half of them -- are bad for men.
You're not going to read this and think it's anything but a blatant statement of male power. 
But the problem is far worse than this.
Women have also learned for decades that they have to say what men want in order to be liked. 
This is why women are not as aggressive as men in negotiating a salary.
This is why women feel less pressure than men to be super-productive at work--a fact which is so obvious to anyone who tries it on for size that it seems like a trivial complaint.
