My name is Julian, and I have short term memory loss. At the age of 21, I began to notice that memories that I had only moments prior were quickly gone. I can remember events that happened years ago, but cannot remember anything from just yesterday.

My life is a constant struggle to stay organized. I write everything down, or else it will be forgotten. I opted to use old fashioned pen and paper, because I needed something I could access anytime, anywhere. I document where I go, who I talk to, and what I do. If I lost the paper, I'd be lost.

My friends and family understand the difficulty that I live with every day. They are patient and understanding when I ask them for reminders of conversations. They always come through for me. 

The toughest part of having short term memory loss is keeping my motivation. No matter what I do, it feels like I will never be able to get ahead. I try to stay positive, even though I know that some days, I just cannot remember what I did earlier that morning.

I remind myself that each day is a chance to start anew, and I'm thankful for those moments. I'm thankful that I can wake up and start fresh with a clean slate. I can make plans, and not be bogged down by what I forgot the day before. 

Living with short term memory loss can be extremely difficult, but I try to stay optimistic. I'm fortunate to have family and friends that support me and understand my condition.  I'm thankful for moments when I can sit back, relax, and enjoy life, even if I don't remember it later.
