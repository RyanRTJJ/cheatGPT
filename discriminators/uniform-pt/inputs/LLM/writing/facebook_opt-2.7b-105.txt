 I'd have to be in the Sol system first.  So I would go to Sol, explore, and find out how the entire planet ended up in quarantine.
Sounds plausible enough.
But if I do that, no one else can write my story!  So they would have to write a story based on the first person's story.
So now you're screwed.
And the problem continues. It seems that all I need to do in a situation like this is to write something that's relevant.
What is that exactly?
Something that relates to the situation.
I'm not sure how relevant it needs to be, you got to come up with your own story. So maybe it doesn't matter.
But no one else could come up with a story based on my story!
I don't really think "others", "like them", "would share the same experience" should be considered. If the situation is real and interesting, it will be an interesting story no matter who writes it.
I agree. But if I ever get a chance to have my story shared, I will be sure not to share it with other people.
Would be a good idea if you planned on publishing.
Planning on publishing the first story? Why would I be planning on publishing at all?
Oh, you mean like writing a book?
I guess, but I'm not entirely sure what that entails. But then again, I would assume that it would involve a publisher, a publisher, some one else having to write a review, etc.
I suppose it would involve a publisher, a publisher, and money.  But that's about it.
Money is actually kinda important, if you're self publishing.
Oh, okay. It just didn't seem like that was a consideration in my original plans, but I suppose it's worth considering.
Yes, please do, even if you're not going to be published :).  I find that writing is cathartic and catharsis is what I really want from my life.
I'll plan on it. Thank you
