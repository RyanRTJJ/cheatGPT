It was a hot summer day, typical of any other day in this small town. Life seemed to continue as usual until they showed up. Two men, both wearing black suits. They didn’t fit in here and I could feel it.

They entered the house and soon enough, I heard shouting and loud noises coming from deep inside. I remained where I was, observing every move they made.

The shouting eventually stopped and so did the sound of anything living. As the men emerged from the house, I noticed a body behind them. It was a man, just lying there lifelessly.

The two men left quickly and all that was left behind was a dead man, the silence, and me. I had never felt so awful before. I was a cheerful inanimate object, but now I didn’t feel so cheerful anymore. All I could feel was despair.

As the days went on, more people came to investigate the murder, but nobody ever found out who the two men were and why they had done such a horrible thing.

But, I remained there and I remember all that had happened. I still feel a somber feeling when I see the man’s lifeless body, but at least I can still be there, keeping watch and never forgetting the events of that day.
