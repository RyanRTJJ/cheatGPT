 You have been given a commission by your fellow soldiers to aid them in their mission against the Dark, but there might be a better use of your time and talents.  (You can choose a role other than your current one.) What are your options: a.  Help the Dark  -  Try to destroy the other side by any means.  You will need every advantage you can get! b.  Help the Light  -  Don't have your team kill the Dark, but do try to stop Satan from obtaining the Sword of Light and thus bring the world to complete destruction.  It is the only way to save our world. c.  Help only the Light  -  Help only when the Dark cannot be stopped.  You are an atheist but you can't just sit back and let the Dark destroy everything. If you choose c:  choose it, but think about how well you were able to keep up the fight, and how much damage could have been done to the other side if you had not been willing to help. The game is played using dice, and the players use their actions to either attack or help the other side.  The game ends when one side is defeated. Please note that this is a tabletop RPG designed to be fun, but not really for high school students. The rules are very simple and should be easy to grasp. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them on the "Reddit". Feel free to suggest any changes or additions to the game, if you'd like, so it can be better for everyone.
