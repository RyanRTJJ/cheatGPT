 For fun, create a unique setting and set the prompt to occur there.
So this is the kind of thing that I'd be interested to hear. Like "What would you do with an hour in a single person's life" kind of things.
Or, if I were an actor, "what I would say to someone in a restaurant."  Something simple, memorable...
I don't know. I like the idea of an actor saying something that would stand out or "change the conversation". It may not be as interesting as saying "what would you do with an hour" in one person's life.
Fair enough.  I'm happy about the interest in this prompt, and I do agree with you in that it's a good way to generate original ideas, but it's not the thread's topic, so I've removed it for those reasons.
What was the original topic, if you don't mind me asking?
I had one posted, but I had to remove it because I was feeling down.  This one is going nowhere.
That's fair. Hope things get better!
Thanks.  I think I'm okay.  My boyfriend gave me some good advice, and my family is also helping me out.  Even still, just feeling all alone and isolated is awful.  It's the holidays...I know it's supposed to be one of the happiest times of my year, but even still, it sucks.
I know exactly how how you feel. I'm about to feel the same way. So, I'm here for you if you ever need someone to talk to.
Thanks.  I appreciate it.  Things have never been this bad in my life, so at least there's that.  :)
I know that feel, man. Life has never been easy for me either. Have you always been this way? I mean, there were moments when things weren't this bad, but there wasn't always always so heavy weight on my shoulders.
Yes.
I know feeling this way is hard. Let's talk it through. Feel free to PM me if you want.
