  You must channel emotion to harness the power, and as you do so your body slowly... begins to change, but not necessarily in a way you'd be comfortable with.   As you find your emotions, your transformation becomes unstoppable.
*The ring of power has no feelings, only hate.*  I think that'd be a pretty intense reading experience :)
Could be an interesting reading, or something...
Sounds intriguing; I look forward to your next story.
You don't get a notification for this?   Oh I see, this is only my second on MAL. Haha.
It's fine. Your story was entertaining enough without me commenting. :)  Do you plan to take submissions? Cause I'd be happy to write if you do.
Well, yeah, if you think it could be fun for other people to read. ^_^   In the off chance you do pick it up,  it's gonna be at least a year before you hear from me about it. If ever.  The only reason I made this account was so I could post here, as it wouldn't be the place to message you.   But you can always look me up on there.
No worries :) I've already got some other stories being worked on so I'll be putting them on hold for a bit but maybe I'll get to it eventually. I love stories about people going through difficult things and growing from it while also looking for ways to help those around them and to heal themselves. I tend to lean more towards fiction rather than nonfiction but if you ever need any advice or a place to ask questions, you can PM me :)
Awesome! :) I don't doubt you'll end up writing a story of your own, so I'll keep that in mind. Sounds like a really cool idea, to go through that period of your life and come out the other side.   Maybe I'll take you up on the "PM me for advice" offer. Thanks for offering!
Any time bud. Good luck with the stories. :)
