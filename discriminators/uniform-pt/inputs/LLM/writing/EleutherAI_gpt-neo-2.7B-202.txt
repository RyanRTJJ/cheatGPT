 

"Let me take the reins today, and you get the honors afterwards," said my second time traveler.

"You'll get mine, too," said my first time traveler.

"I got mine yesterday, didn't I?"

 "You did, but it's not exactly the same story."

"What's different between the two different versions?"

"Well, my account doesn't include time travelling by helicopter to the Arctic or an alien invasion."

"Why did you tell me my version?"

"No reason! That would've taken away the surprise!"

"Your description of the future made it seem like it would be interesting."

"I didn't mean that! What's interesting is the difference between yours and mine, not me telling you my version!"

 This is a story that may have two possible endings.

If you picked the second story, be sure to save the two characters' story notes in separate notebooks. Note that they are from different time lines. This way, should their account diverge, you'll be able to come up with a third account—one that you could only have told them if you were from both versions.

## How to Go Back, Time Traveler or Time Stationery

There are many ways to go back in time—for example, you can go back to a point in the past that never actually happened. Or you can go back to a character in a series who met such-and-such important historical person of interest. Or you can return to a moment in the past involving so-and-so and such-and-such famous scientist. Or you can go back to a moment where events have already taken place (if you're talking about an experiment). You can go back time for the exact event that will happen in your time line—or you'll go back to tell a different version of that event. Or you can go back to visit the actual place where the story takes place in time (an ancient palace, a medieval castle...).  

Once you've written a story that takes place in the past, you can go back to tell a tale
