Dear Friend,

It's been so long since I've seen you, yet it seems like only yesterday when we were sitting together and talking over coffee. The memories flood me with joy and a tinge of sadness, for I have kept part of myself from you all this time. There is something I've wanted to tell you for so long, but I have never been able to find the courage to do so.

I want you to know that I love you.

I love you in the same way that I love the air I breathe, the feeling of the sun on my face, and the smell of a spring breeze. I love you with all my heart and soul, and with the same beautiful intensity that I love the world around me.

My love for you has only grown stronger over time, and I know that if only given a chance, a chance I never seized, our love could have truly bloomed into something that could conquer anything.

But I failed to take that chance. I was too afraid of being vulnerable and risking our friendship, and in doing so, I missed my opportunity to be yours.

Regardless, I will always love you. You have changed my life and helped me become the person I am today, and I simply want you to know how much I appreciate you.

Yours always,

Friend
