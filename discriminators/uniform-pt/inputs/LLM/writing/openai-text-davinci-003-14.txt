I have an old watch that I inherited from my grandfather. It is a thing of beauty and it holds such sentiment for me-my grandfather was a great man who had many adventures and I love to think of him each time I look at it. The only problem is that it doesn't work. 

It has a treasured place on my wrist, even though I know it's inaccurate. Every once in a while, I'll catch myself glancing at it, as if the hands will have magically started to move. Then I remember the truth, and it's a sobering reminder of the time that has passed since I last saw my grandfather. 

I'm not sure why I hold onto it, even though I know it's broken. Its presence feels important for some reason. It's a reminder of my grandfather and the many stories he shared with me about his life and his travels. He lived in a different era, an era of stillness, of quiet moments. Before phones and computers ruled the world. 

Every time I wear this watch, broken and unable to tell the time, I'm reminded of those slow, silent days in my grandfather's house. Of the simple beauty of life - and of the importance of cherishing the little things.
