It had been 20 years since I moved into my home, and I knew its every crevice and corner. Or so I thought. Today however, something unusual happened. As I was tidying up the house, I noticed a door I had never seen before tucked away in the corner of the hallway. It was as if it had appeared out of nowhere! Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to see where it led.

When I opened the door, I saw what appeared to be a portal to another world. I cautiously stepped cautiously through the portal and found myself standing on a beach by an emerald sea. It was stunning, with sunshine beaming down and the smell of tropical plants in the air. For a moment, I was in total awe of this secret paradise, its beauty impossible to describe in words.

Slowly I made my way along the beach, and to my surprise, I could hear voices in the distance. As I got closer, I realized that the voices belonged to two of my old college friends, ones I hadn't seen in years! In disbelief, I quickly ran up the sand and embraced them both.

We talked for hours about life and our travels, and I found out that this beach was something of a portal, a doorway between worlds. Somehow, a part of my home had hidden this magical place from me for all those years and only now had revealed it.

I returned home, of course, but since then I've gone back to that preferred spot many times. Each time, I pause to take a moment and marvel at the fact that, even after 20 years of living in my home, there was still something extraordinary I hadn't even noticed.
