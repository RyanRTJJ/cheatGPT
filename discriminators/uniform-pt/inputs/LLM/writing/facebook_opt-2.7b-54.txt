 Note: I'm not saying you should do it. It's only a suggestion.
That kind of seems too depressing. I feel that people should look at it for the joy it can bring. I mean shit - do you want to live out your last hours on earth surrounded by nothing but a million people trying to kill each other and the only thing you want to do is eat? No. It's much better to go out and be as happy as possible while you still have the chance.
A man who knows true suffering, you are a true friend to those who live. You just don't realize it. For those living, you are the life, you are the wind that blows on their life.
You have just made this awesome poem my life. Thank you for your contribution (that was so cool)
I always wanted to write poems too, maybe tomorrow. :3
You should for sure, and please don't be shy. It's a lot of fun and a way to express yourself through words.
Yeah, maybe. I'm still a bit scared about posting them tho, they aren't very "nice" I guess. *I've got to get that back somehow*
I like your poetry a lot, I've actually read a few. You can go for more if you want :)
Thank you really. I always say I'm too "awkward", but then I got a lot of words on my mind. Thank you.
So what'd the meteor do?  Did its tail kill some small critters?
It didn't kill them, but I got a bit of a headache after it ended.
That's why we've come up with "curing headaches". Try going for the ones caused by your mind. You'll feel better that way.
Oh, thanks kind sir. How did you find out about that?
