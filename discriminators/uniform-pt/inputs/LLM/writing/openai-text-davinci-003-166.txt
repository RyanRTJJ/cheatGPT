Lexi was feeling particularly lost and frustrated in her life. She had been working hard for a long time but hadn't moved closer to achieving any of her dreams. She wanted to make changes to her life but couldn't figure out where to begin.

Feeling discouraged, Lexi decided to ask her best friend, "What should I do?" Her friend was quick to respond, "Set some goals - that's the best way to start. Decide what it is that you want, create a plan to get there, and make sure you're holding yourself accountable to actually achieve it."

Taking her friend's advice, Lexi sat down and tried to figure out what her goals were. She was feeling overwhelmed at first, but after some thought, Lexi began to develop a plan.

She decided to start small and wrote out one goal that would be both achievable and enjoyable. She decided to commit to exercising three times a week, so she would have the physical and emotional strength to pursue the bigger goals.

Lexi also created a timeline and set up an accountability system, telling her friends and family about her goals and asking for their help. She made it a habit to check in with them and report on her progress.

Lexi also took the time to reflect often, adjusting her plan when necessary and trusting that, if she stuck to her goals and kept at it, she would get closer to her dreams.

With her clear plan and commitment, Lexi finally began to make progress. She felt encouraged and excited to think that she was taking those first important steps towards achieving her goals.
