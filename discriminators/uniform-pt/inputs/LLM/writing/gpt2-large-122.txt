How to complete the story:

There are many ways to go about telling your story:

Write a blog post about your experience. This has a lot of advantages, but it takes extra time to work out the right wording, as this is where you would have to tell all the story of the experience, not just just about one part of it (ie, the ride). This means you might not get as much out of it. If you know of a good book or blog that you can talk about your experience, that would be great. If you'd rather not talk too much in general, simply read the story aloud, with or without music, to yourself. This can give you a much more emotional and personal experience. The key to a good narrative, in my experience, is to not over-tell the story. Write it as if the person you're talking about is present and present in your head, and you're writing it in the present tense.

How to create a video game based on the story: Make sure your story is clear! What happened that day? How has it affected you? What did he have to go through during the ride?

Do you have any experiences or other people to share who had a similar experience as you did?
