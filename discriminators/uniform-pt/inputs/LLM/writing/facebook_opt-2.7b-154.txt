 It's always interesting to see the different stories the writers come up with.
Good point but I'll do something a little more in depth. I'll write a story out of my prompt if I need to give out one. It's better to use the prompt for the sake of keeping a consistent voice rather than trying to find that magical story.
Alright, have you already wrote one? It'll be fun to read.
What? I did one for you. Is that not good enough?
Lets call it a tie :) Thanks, really good prompt. You should edit a little closer though, grammar and whatnot.
Okay then I will. Not much to say. I just made a quick story and posted it. Lol.
Cool, have fun with it. My favorite thing about you is your voice. I hope you post more stories in the future :)
Wow thank you! I will do! I'll probably do a one and done prompt type deal from now on.
I can’t wait to read it. That being said, I just sent you a DM over reddit. Sorry for taking so long to respond, I was very busy.
No worries, it isn't a big deal. I sent it from my phone, I'll check it out when I get home.   Edit: Okay, I read. I liked it quite a bit, but I feel like a big chunk could be left out. It was kind of just word salad, haha. A little boring at times but there's some depth there.
Aww, thanks :) I’m glad it was enjoyable. I could try to adjust it but I’m not very good when it comes to writing, lol.
That's very impressive. I'm usually very lazy when writing as well, sometimes I just hit delete and start over.
