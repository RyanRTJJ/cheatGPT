       Oh and happy birthday! Hope it has gone well.
Well, it's a dog's perspective so it could be kinda boring :/
Maybe. If you find you have fun writing with other people, why not try writing like a friend or parent might, who is close to your dog, you wouldn't have to pretend about it and you wouldn't have to worry about the other person.
I'm gonna try but I don't think my dog is gonna like it.. :( (although he is the only one that will sit still for me to write while I draw him)
Maybe find a cat? Or perhaps your sister's dog or a friends, both of which may be good subjects for the prompt?
Ahaha ooh, that's pretty good :D but my sister said she isn't an avid reader (my dad's the one that reads the most) and I don't really like drawing stuff so that's not a good idea :P
Ah, you should really take a look at reddit's writing prompts page then.
I don't know how to read though, i'm only eleven lmao
Do you have a friend you can read with? I'd be happy to help :)
I guess i am kinda shy though :(
Aw well, if you ever feel like learning I'll be able to help!
I really might try to learn then :D
If you ever need any help I also know how to write for it, let me know :)
Well thank you, but all I really want to do is just draw and write stuff.
Sure, no problem! Just write back if you need help!
Thanks :D   Sorry for being so forward, I wasn't prepared to accept a hug :D but it's nice to have someone caring about me :3
It's alright, I'm the same with that :p   Have a good day!   Oh, and I would love if you wanted to share those stories with me someday haha
