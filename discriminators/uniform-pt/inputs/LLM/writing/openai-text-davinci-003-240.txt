John was the world's best hitman; he had quite the reputation for being a ruthless killer of men. But this time, the job he was about to undertake wasn't about killing just any man, it was about killing the world's luckiest man.

John had never been one to believe in luck, but he knew that the man he was planning to take out had gotten himself into some pretty sticky situations, and yet somehow he had been able to slip out of them, unscathed each and every time. The man had a certain aura about him which could not go unnoticed by John and it unnerved him.

The night before the hit, John prepared for the job by digging out his trusty sniper rifle and relishing the thought of the challenge ahead of him. He then practiced the shot in his mind; steadying his aim and picturing his target's final moments.

The following morning, John took his place atop the abandoned apartment building, glass of whiskey in hand, and waited for the luckiest man in the world to pass by. The hit was quick, John squeezed the trigger, the body fell and then he vanished into the night.

Though John never believed in luck, he couldn't help but think about the irony of his own life; he was the world's best hitman, and yet he was always able to escape unscathed every single time. No matter how hard he tried, he was never able to take out the luckiest man in the world.
