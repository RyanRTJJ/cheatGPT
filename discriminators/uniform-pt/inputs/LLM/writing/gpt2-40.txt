 You probably didn't know you were there.  I'm going to introduce you to a woman.  What follows is a story of two men.  You will have to forgive them. (The man we're going to talk about was an attractive, well-spoken, handsome guy, and his mom had a crush on him and has been dating him for over a decade.) He was dating a woman.  I just asked this: was there any evidence to suggest you were ever sexually attracted to this woman? Did she mention that you were gay or did she just say something about you and tell you she didn't. Did you hear anything about your marriage to this woman? Did she use a condom in the room where your children were playing? Did she make up a story about being a virgin or something? Did you think you could do better than to take an action to convince her? I understand that the question is about how people are being victimized when no one else is doing anything.  The point is that men are not victims.  No one can stop men from raping a woman. Not all women are sexually aroused and are not raped and not all rapists are rapists.  These things can be worked out just because a woman is attracted to such people.  My point here is that men are victims of their victims because they are men.  And so, when you start taking action, when you find yourself in a situation where you're victimized, you should think about your power.  You should consider why there is a woman in your life.  Have sex, go on dates, talk to women.  You may not want a woman to have you on your good side.  Or you may be too timid and pushy and say, "You've never been to this place before you'll just have to call it home." Then you can get a lot of relief.  If women start taking action to protect you, you'll be more afraid you're going to hurt all of my people.  So, why you should look to action for what it can do.
Proving this.
