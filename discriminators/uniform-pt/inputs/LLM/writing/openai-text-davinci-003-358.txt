I was William Clark, a part of the famous Lewis and Clark Expedition. I had been traveling with Lewis for months now, and our relationship had grown closer, like brothers almost. As we camped together our bond had grown even stronger. I trusted him implicitly and rarely ever suspected he was holding anything back, until today.

I entered his tent unannounced and found him sitting on the floor of his canvas residence. He seemed to be lost in thought, pouring over a large, tattered book. Across his legs were small stacks of paper, each full of hastily scribbled notes and messages. I knew something was amiss as I stepped closer to examine the contents of his cluttered space.

As I moved in closer I suddenly noticed the distinct smell of burning. That is when I saw it; a low lantern with a smoke-filled glass dome, full of burning coal. It was then I realized what I had stumbled upon. Lewis was studying top secret documents that had been part of our mission.

My heart raced as I pieced together the truth. Lewis had his hands deep in the pockets of the government and was planning an escape. He was going to use the secrets of the documents to buy his freedom and our expedition would be over.

I quickly left the tent, too disappointed and shocked at the truth to speak. Our mission was to explore and discover the West, but now Lewis had decided to turn this into something much more sinister. My life had changed forever, and there was nothing I could do about it.
