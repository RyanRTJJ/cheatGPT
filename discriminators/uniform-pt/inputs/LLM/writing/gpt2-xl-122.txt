The story opens on a clear, cold night in June. Two children in matching black uniforms approach the fair booth, and soon the booth and its occupants turn dark and dingy. "Excuse me, but I have a question," one of the children asks, "if you're not the ride operator, maybe you could ask the person next to you, and so on."

The booth operator is a slight man in his early 50's with a long, black beard. His blue eyes are bright and alert. "Hi," he greets the girl. "I don't ride these rides as part of my job. But this last ride here I did when I was in college. I see things and I can tell you about it, and you see things the same way."

"Well, if you could tell me, why did you let us get on that ride before we started driving it?" says the younger boy excitedly.

"Because I have to know why some kids get on the ride," says the older boy.

"But don't the rides always go when the doors open?" prompts the little girl.

"Sure do," counters the tall man with his hand on his hip. "But at least here I can always see who gets on the ride."

"Thanks, sir," the little girl says, and the two depart with the rest of the crowd on a ride called Big Daddy.

The next day, the little boy's father asks, "Ryleigh, what are these two boys talking about?" The boy turns to his father, and explains, "They had their ride, this one called Big Daddy, and when it started to go I looked into it and it went and it was all full of mud."
