 Do it!
> "Dangerous" people are a 1, while a trained man with an assault rifle might be a 7.   And then what? The person goes "Hey, I've been doing some calculations and apparently this guy is definitely a 7"?
It depends how close you are willing to be to the truth. A 7 is very dangerous, but so is a 1 since that is just as much a subjective idea of danger as anything else.  Your character would probably just say he was making an educated guess as to how dangerous the kid was based on how he looks. Of course, that could be misconstrued as him attempting to make an opinion based on facts.
But still, how do you know what a "7 "actually means?  I mean, we can't really judge people's looks, because it's subjective, but the danger scale is obviously not.
It means that you have a 7 point scale for danger from 1 to 10. The guy is more than likely not a 1.7, more likely a 1.4 or 1.5 and if you were close to the truth you'd say he's probably about a 3.   I mean that is the point of this game after all. You don't know, but you can try to guess.
Oh, ok. That clears stuff up. Thanks.
No worries. The other thing I forgot to mention is that you need to write at least 2 of these, because while your character will get the chance at both a 10 and 1, another kid also gets the chance at both a 7 and a 1 which could mean a couple different things. As such, you'll want to make sure you've got some backup characters that are either 10 or 1, so if there are a bunch of kids
