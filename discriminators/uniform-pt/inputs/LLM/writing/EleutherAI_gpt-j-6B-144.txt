There have been no movies depicting battles in which humans fight against soldiers of super-nature, but at least one science fiction game makes use of the concept.
At the start of Interstellar Frontier a large group of aliens invade a human world. The humans have no chance of defeating them. But a human genius, one who has recently had a super-human injection of an alien serum, devises a cunning plan. He creates a special human soldiers, and gives these soldiers the serum as well.
His cunning plan: The humans do a surprise attack, and use a massive laser cannon to blind the aliens with a massive burst of light, then the human'soldiers' throw the super powered aliens into the path of the cannon and they are destroyed.
I can't remember much about it, except that I really liked this novel. Probably not my answer but the other thing I can't remember is the game that I played.

 But all this time, the idea that humans can build such soldiers must by no means cease to exist, because in fact, such soldiers are being experimented on secretly now. It has actually already become standard practice in some countries.

I believe that there might be a TV anime adaptation that used this plot (though I have only vague details).

The first actual battle that I can think of that was an all-human (well, most-human) battle was the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, in spring 1954.
While Wikipedia says that North Vietnamese regular infantry (the NLF, the Viet Cong, etc.) eventually came up with their own counter-insurgency tactics in response, the first real major all-human (well, mostly human) battle came when the French withdrew their regular troops and just relied on a very hard-wired human counter-insurgency force. The main point of this was that the French (and later the Vietnamese) had no way to call in the artillery that the enemy might be using.
