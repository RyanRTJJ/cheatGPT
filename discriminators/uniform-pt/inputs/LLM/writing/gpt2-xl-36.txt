 There's a bit too much blood and a lot of it is on the ground.  A little bit disturbed, the kid runs into the woods the next day searching for the corpse and discovers a door to a dark dungeon.  He's trapped in this dungeon for 100 years and may be the only victim.  But a ghost named Chantrey shows up and helps with the search and also lets him choose the location of his death.  But, be warned, it's a very dark place, filled with skeletons, demonic entities and monsters all hoping to get an easy meal. 1-2 hours (about 30 minutes) Story is from a mythology in progress (a work in progress, don't worry) and no promises for its completion.
