He had left home for work early this morning, as he usually did. But today, something felt strangely off. He couldn’t put his finger on it but he felt uneasy. As he walked along the street, something was missing. He looked around and he soon realized what it was. He recalled how even on the quietest of days, the birds could always be heard. But today, there was no sound of any kind. Not a single tweet or chirp. Anywhere.

He stopped and looked all around him. Not a single bird to be seen. He couldn’t believe it. Where had all the birds gone? He furrowed his brows, feeling more uneasy than before. He took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling and he continued on his way to work.

He tried to push the thought out of his mind as he walked, but he couldn’t help but wonder what had happened to the birds. Had they all flown away? He looked up at the sky, but still, no birds to be seen. He shuddered, an unsettling feeling in the pit of his stomach. He quickened his pace and soon, he had arrived at work.

The feeling of unease still lingered but he pushed it away, hoping it was just some weird coincidence. He surely was overthinking things. But even so, the absence of birds still nagged at his mind.
