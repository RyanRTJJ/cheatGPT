With trembling hands, the protagonist stepped into the phone booth in the afterlife, feeling like a contestant on a surreal game show. He had been given the opportunity to make one sixty-second call and he wanted to make the most of it. The booth was adorned with velvet curtains, a chandelier, and even a leather armchair.

He closed his eyes, feeling a sudden rush of emotions. This might be the only chance he had to talk to someone from life one last time. After a few seconds of rumination, the protagonist knew who he wanted to call: his best friend.

Drawing in a deep breath, the protagonist dialed the number. After a few rings, his friend picked up.

"Hello?" 

The protagonist wasted no time in replying. 

"My friend… I'm sorry I never told you all the things I felt while I was alive. But I want you to know that I love you. I know my death has been hard on you, and I'm so sorry for leaving you the way I did. I just wish I could have held you one last time… Goodbye, my friend." 

His voice broke in the last few words, and he ended the call. Tears streamed down his face as he realized he would never speak with his friend again, nor anyone else. He was truly alone in the afterlife. He stepped out of the phone booth and looked up at the star-filled sky, a sad smile tugging at his lips. He had said his goodbyes.
