Chelsea and Eric had known each other since grade school but had been out of touch for a few years following college. Recently, however, they’d have the occasional run-in at the local pub and had started to hit it off once again. One night, their conversations steered to the topic of relationships and Eric suggested to Chelsea the idea of a ‘friends with benefits’ type arrangement. Thinking it was a good idea, Chelsea agreed.

At first it was just physical, nothing too serious. They both knew that it was wrong to be having these trysts and so they kept it under wraps, rarely ever seen in public together. But as time rolled by, it became clear that their relationship was developing into something more than just a physical affair.

Chelsea started to look forward to the times they shared together, relying on them to get through the week and increasingly missing him when they were apart. Sadly, however, neither one of them was willing to go public with their new relationship. His fear was that it would shatter his reputation in their small hometown and her fear was that it would ruin the friendship they’d worked so hard to rekindle.

Still, they kept seeing each other on the sly, secretly treasuring the moments they shared together. Little by little, their feelings for each other were growing stronger and stronger but they were still too afraid to admit it. What started out as ‘friends with benefits’ was slowly but surely turning into love, both of them trying to keep it a secret for fear of it ending before it had a chance to properly begin.
