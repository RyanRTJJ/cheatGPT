 If you're just beginning a new book, you can be yours. As long as you're following the rules, follow them. Don't try to figure out some neat rules and/or how to figure them out. You won't have an effective solution. The solution you set yourself involves getting out of the office early and making sure you're ready after you leave. You need to be aware of what, if anything, must happen to take time out of your day to actually plan your day. Just know that by going out late and doing things that you are not supposed to, your plan of action will take years to build. I've been fortunate to work with my family and friends who have taken out loan-backed debt and to work on real-world ventures. I've gotten my hands dirty. Some of those friends have decided to turn to art because they still need to make money. Others who are self-reliant because they didn't go to school because they weren't given a good job that paid well are still struggling to make ends meet. Some of the people I have worked with who have been really good at their jobs are also self-reliant and have no interest in working in the real world. But there are plenty of examples where this kind of personal development is the single easiest way to come out and contribute your hard work.

I do. Let's get this over with. I believe she really is a good writer. It doesn't mean she's wrong
