Let there be no shadow of a doubt, that in all the ways I have considered it, I have considered the way in which the past decade may turn out in the future. As we know of course from our history, as well as my own history, the last one to be won was World War II; although I know of another war and several conflicts that many want to forget.  I think it is better than to wait; more than this, it is better for humanity, and for all of mankind if sooner or later, this era of great changes does end.  I cannot think of any reason why one should wait any longer.  What is the point of a world gone mad if there is good news to be had, but bad news will come to bite you for two years or so?  I have no sense that the world will be a worse place by waiting, but that may be inevitable. I do think it would be best to begin anew, starting with this one, and continuing with the others.  In the past, the world has been split into two groups; the better off part, and the other half.  There was one group that loved and desired the old ways; and the other, which was more suspicious, desired something different.  I have often said that all cultures can change, and that each of us must choose our share of history, for the future of humanity, or we will fail to see anything worthwhile in life. A year from now, maybe ten hundred years from now, perhaps an age after that...  I will be looking back at what I can see, and perhaps we as a species can do the same; I know the only change that must be expected in our world is at the end of this one.  Perhaps I will have to change even before I'm done writing them. Perhaps this one will not die, will never end, and in its place will continue
