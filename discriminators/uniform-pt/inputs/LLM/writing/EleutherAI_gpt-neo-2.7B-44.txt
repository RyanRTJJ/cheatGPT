The bus stop from Hell. We're going to drive all the way out to the edge of the world; the last mile or so on asphalt. In the very last car—only the top two or three are going to roll in this one. We're going to see where the line of demarcation ends for the universe. So many strange things happen in that last mile (including a meteorite that strikes the top of the car), and then the driver's going to take the first turn coming to our side, and then we'll be on the edge (where we'll see for the first time), and then we'll go on down to the last and final car. Except this has been going for twenty minutes already, and it's getting dark...

"Then we'll start over with a new question," says the driver. You know this is where the story is going, because he says: "One of us thinks we should make a movie," which is why he got that phone call last month. Or he thinks that because he says so. But he doesn't really know why (except that he thinks we're a pair of filmmakers who could make a movie); a movie (what's that? Some kind of art? It's a film and he wants to make a film with us... oh, that's right—we're both filmmakers...); but he wants to make a movie with us; and a movie means, it means art. Art can mean anything at this point, including art.... When you make a movie on your own you do a good job of telling a story, and at the same time the film becomes part of your life. Maybe it's the fact that it's been going on for twenty long minutes now like a silent movie like on a loop: you know that when you don't have time and so have to take twenty minutes to talk about something... What would you do if
