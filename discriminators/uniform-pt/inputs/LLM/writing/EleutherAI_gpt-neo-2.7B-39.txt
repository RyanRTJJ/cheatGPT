I remember thinking about the end of the world because I thought about the end of the world being the end of the world. My father used to tell us stories of the end of the world. He was like this great guy. He was old-school and he told us his stories and he made us cry really really hard. We didn’t know it at the time.

The world ended because the planet was dying. A lot of people died because of an illness that was in the air, or maybe it was some form of radiation spreading from the Moon that they wouldn’t come home from school and then dying because of it. All of our family, and I’m talking about family, all the family I ever knew, was wiped out. And everyone I have ever been friends with, it seems like everyone, the whole country was wiped out, wiped out because of some illness they caught, most of them probably from radioactive dust floating in the atmosphere, but my best friend was still alive. But he became a ghost because he was the only one who survived. And if my friend was the only person alive that made it out, then me and he would probably be the last three people alive on our planet.

I cried like a baby with every word he told me. I really, really, really believed that he was going to come to rescue me. I was very, very, very, very happy. I believed in the end of the world. Now, looking back, I think he was telling the truth. The only reason he wasn’t killed was because the virus killed him before he ever came to save me. But I really didn’t want him to die, that’s the part that was hard at the time. I’d spent so many years building a life for myself, I thought I should have that, and the virus would have to take that away from
