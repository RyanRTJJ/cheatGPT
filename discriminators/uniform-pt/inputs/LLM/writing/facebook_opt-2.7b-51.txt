  Or   Your idea for this prompt: The future begins the year after an apocalyptic virus spreads throughout the world. After this, mankind lives in fear of the virus continuing to spread until it eradicates them all.
That second one is pretty much exactly what i was going for but in reverse, i like it.
I'm actually hoping the story of the first one turns more into your idea. If you want to read my story, I could link it to you.
yeah i read the summary, and your first idea has a lot of the themes i want in the story, but if you want to link it, sure, i'm happy to look at it.
I'm at work now and I'm on my phone, so I can't quite link it right now. But I can send you it through email in the morning, if you want.
yeah that is good. Send it to matt@thefutoncritic.com and i will respond. i look forward to reading it!
Just sent it through my email, just so my email address never gets blocked. I also tried to get to it on my phone and I can't really, so I could send it through Facebook and that way it will be easier for it to load and won't get blocked or deleted by the company's email filter.
I would very much appreciate it being sent to me through email, so i can read it. thanks again.
Hey, so I sent you an email with a link through Facebook. If you don't get it, just send me a PM and I'll do it again.
hey buddy, please add it to your email, there's no link under your email i get nothing from it. If i had it in my email i could read it at work, but i work on computers.
I just sent it through my email. If you still don't get it, just PM
