Evelyn and Will had been friends for many years, but this evening was something special. After wandering around their town, they had found themselves close to the beach in pitch black night. Despite the late hour, neither of them wanted to go home yet. 

They were drawn to the starry sky, which glistened with an unrivalled intensity despite the lights of the city that surrounded them. Evelyn and Will grabbed sticks and a bucket of sand. They then set to making their own sky, crafting a constellation of stars illuminated by the full moonlight that hung over them.

Every now and then, their laughter would break the silence, echoing in their small stretch of paradise. 

When it was time for Evelyn and Will to return home, they found themselves caught in that moment for longer. Finally, Will smiled at Evelyn and uttered the phrase that would remain with her for many years to come. 

"Do you remember the starry sky we created that night?" he said. It was as if they were a part of its beauty, and somehow making it special. 

Evelyn smiled as she nodded her head, and the two of them parted ways. But no matter where they went, in their minds they would forever be standing on that beach, creating a starry sky together.
