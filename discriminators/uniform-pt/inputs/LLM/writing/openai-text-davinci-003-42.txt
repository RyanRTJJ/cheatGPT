as I stepped onto the bridge

The sun beamed down on me as I stepped onto the wooden bridge. The birds chirped in the trees and the gentle waves lapped quietly against the shore. Everything was peaceful and serene. 

But I couldn’t enjoy it. As soon as I stepped foot on the bridge, the air left my lungs. My legs trembled and my heart felt like it was going to explode from my chest. I knew what I had to do. 

After what had happened the night before, I knew I couldn’t go back. I had to take the only way out that I saw. I slowly made my way across the bridge, taking one trembling step after another. 

The bridge seemed to go on forever and my legs were growing more and more tired with every step. I stumbled and nearly lost my balance but I managed to catch myself before I fell. 

When I finally reached the other side of the bridge, I let out a deep breath of relief and felt the air rushing back into my lungs. Tears rushed down my cheeks and I took a few moments to collect myself. 

I had done it. I had taken the only way out and crossed that bridge. Now, I could start a new life and make something of myself. I wiped away my tears, squared my shoulders and started to walk closer towards my future.
