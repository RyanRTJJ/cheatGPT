Jack shivered as he stepped onto the frozen lake. He had heard the stories, but he hadn't believed them until now. He had come to the lake in search of a cure, but now he realized he had been on a fool's errand.

He glanced around at the icy landscape. Everywhere he looked, he could see a blanket of white. It glistened in the moonlight, a glimmering portrait of death.

Jack had heard tales of a man who could heal any wound. He had sought out this legend, desperate for a cure for his own ailment. But when he had reached the lake, he found something unexpected.

The man was nowhere to be found. Instead, he had encountered a powerful spirit. She had been here for centuries, trapped in her icy prison. She had promised to heal him if he would give her what she wanted.

At first, Jack had refused. He could not make such a bargain with a spirit. But as his condition worsened, he realized he had no choice. He agreed to her demands, and before long, he was deep in a trance.

When he awoke, the spirit was gone. But in its place was a pool of ice. Jack stepped cautiously forward. He nearly gasped as he saw what was frozen inside.

The entire lake was full of blood. His own blood.

He had given the spirit his life essence, and she had taken it all. He felt weak, but he also felt something else: a sense of peace. He knew he had done the right thing.

By the time he had finished, there was no blood left. Only ice.
