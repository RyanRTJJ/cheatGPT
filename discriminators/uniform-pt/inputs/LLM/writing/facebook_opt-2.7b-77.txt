 Make sure they write it as if they are the one who is telling Google how to run it.    Bonus points if you make it about some crazy conspiracy involving the "real Google" being in cahoots with some shadowy company like the NSA or something.
I like this idea. I will consider your suggestion. Thank you!  edit: i am still looking for more ideas as well. any and all are welcome. :)
Do it! Post a link if you do. I'd read it if I had time. Good luck! I'm going to assume you mean your own story, and not like, a random stranger's...
I am thinking of making it about the whole world going down after Google goes down but I am not sure how to implement it.
What do you mean by the whole world? Like, a virus? If so, explain how you came up with the idea. Explain how it could be made realistic. It could have other elements as well. Does that make sense?
The whole world is going down a day after Google. there is a virus on their.
How long would it be for the virus to spread worldwide?
about 2 hours.
So by 2 hours, you mean the two hours following Google going down?
yeah, the following two hours. so it's about 1.5 hours after when the two hours begin.
This is kind of random, but it might be better to show the virus spreading in real time. Like, a virus infects 10% of people, and then spreads itself across the globe in 12 hours. But, I guess this would not be a very exciting story overall.
that's my fear as well
It will show that the virus spread *too* fast. The virus being fast makes sense though. Google just went down, so what else could happen?  Maybe you could write a story in which Google never goes down though. In which case, show people working at the company scrambling to find the cause and what was wrong. And then in the end, the virus shows up
