Please subscribe for the new book: http://amazon.com/dp/B00I5Y7Y4Q A few months ago I received a question regarding how to write fiction without writing a check (see https://thewar onworcomplements.blogspot.com/2016/06/how-to-get-a-check.html ). I thought I would share my answers for this question: How do I get a check for writing this story? Here are the answers: A good writing job is essential (a good editor, and good writers need good writers). Good editors, which include someone who has no experience writing fiction at all, can be a huge help. I have a handful of good writing friends online. All three of my friends are editors and all three of them have helped me find writers I could read and use to write the story that will stand the test of time. I am also using Patreon because I want to get this story into the hands of as many readers as possible for a higher chance of receiving funding (see http://patreon.com/lone_knight/support for more info). When you support Lone Knight, I am able to offer a few perks. One perk is that I will give away a free copy of The Shadow War to a fan of your choice after each paypal pledge. This is for both myself and two other friends. A second perk is that I will publish a book called Dark Eras: The War to End All Wars, which will be a collection of short stories featuring some of my favorite characters, including yours truly. (Not just because I enjoy these stories or because I plan to write more!) This could happen, for example, if the book earns enough funding to pay for its editing: Thank you, and I look forward to working together on my next anthology
