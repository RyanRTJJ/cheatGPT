Oh wow, that sounds like a lot of work!

Yeah, me too.

Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Bye!"

Phone Conversation 2 (Both Sides):
"Hi! It's been so long! How are you?"

"Hi! I'm doing pretty good. Just been really busy with work and life in general lately."

"Yeah, me too. Let's catch up soon to talk more about this."

"Okay, I'll talk to you soon.
