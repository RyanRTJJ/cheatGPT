 I don't think it would have the same sort of appeal as an angelic version of Earth though.
Wouldn't it need more of a human dimension to work?
It could work well if you made it sci-fi and alienated from Earth in the current era. There's really nothing in the Bible apart from Leviticus, so there could definitely be a decent sci-fi premise there.

The Exodus story from Leviticus should be about Heaven's inhabitants, but it is the Earth that is the story of humanity.  The Exodus story should begin and end with Genesis.
And then follow Leviticus for the rest of the book, which could turn into a comedy.

Of course not, so that leaves us with angels fighting against humans?
That was a joke.
Ah, so a joke that could turn into a tragedy if it were taken too seriously.  Good one!
God's wrath could only be so intense, after all.
God doesn't actually get angry...
Of course he gets angry... But the "angry" god didn't really have anything to do with the biblical Exodus story.
Right, but "God's wrath" could be a joke or a serious story.
And that's why the film could be funny and serious at the same time!
