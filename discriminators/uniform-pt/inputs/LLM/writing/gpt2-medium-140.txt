------------------------- [ I was once part of an alternate reality with all of its events as they truly unfolded. There was an event on Earth with all of the worlds connected within a single continent, which caused all of our world events to happen. I was once part of this alternate world. Now that I am aware of the event, I want to take action to stop it. I decided this was my opportunity. I decided to take it upon myself to travel to a different alternate reality with all of the world's events completely different. ] [ After that is over I go back and re-live my experience with Daisy and she ends up becoming the perfect wife for my future daughter. This alternate world is much more like our own and makes for a much more authentic time where I am living my life as if it had never happened. Also, there are some things I am doing that I don't do in our reality and I think this time would improve things for both us or I would be sad...] [ Once I meet Daisy I immediately fell in love and had some children. This timeline is the best timeline for them. I even have the choice to marry Daisy in this reality and/or get a preplanned pregnancy and end my wife's pregnancy. The events of this timeline are the best ones. I decided this is the way I would want them and my daughter would thrive and be a better person while living in this beautiful alternate reality. ] [ You know where to find me and where to find my daughter Daisy? I live in a home called the Big Apple. My family lives in a house on the other side of the road, just off of Interstate 75. I was born in this alternate world and live with Daisy
