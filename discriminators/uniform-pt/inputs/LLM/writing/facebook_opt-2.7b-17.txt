 *What is your event?*
So, I've been alive for 2 decades and died 20 times? I'll say that's the most painful.
Well yeah. That's why you were reborn a hundred times. That isn't as bad as the 1000 times though. Try 500 maybe? Or better yet, 1,000 times. If you go past some threshold you get sent to a special room in the afterlife where no one goes until you get back. It could be torture until then.
I think I'd rather go back in time, become an immortal, and live another 20 years.   I didn't really want to come back anyway because I could be any kind of being in my 20s or 30s, like a robot or something.
Maybe if you didn't go to college this time.
Well, I already don't go to college because it's not really possible for me to even if I wanted to.
Well that's good. You can be an immortal robot now if you want.
I've always wanted to be the robot of choice in a Futurama episode.
Not a good robot though, just a good enough one.
I'm going to be the one to end all robots! I'm going to end life and death.
I'll be this time too! Maybe I have a shot! Maybe I'll be the one to turn death and life from being just this one thing into many, many new universes. It's my destiny!
I'm going to have a great career. I'm going to be the most important person in the world. No one ever heard of me, but when robots start to do things they were never programmed to, I'll help them do it. I'll help them become the only important person in existence. I'm going to be the leader of the most important robots in the universe.
I'm becoming the greatest robot scientist in all of creation! I will change the world before the world changes
