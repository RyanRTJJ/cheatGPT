Your protagonist must:

Own the watch. No matter how often you look at it the watch still doesn’t work.
Have it taken apart and the parts put together to make it operate properly.
Go to a professional and ask for repairs and the watch will become more functional.
Have the professional fix the clock again.
Ask someone new to try on the watch and get him to tell you that the clock will work.

Each section answers must remain true to the character, yet also reflect the challenge of the story. Think of characters, settings, dialogue, and plot in your story. You have four weeks.

Write 3,000 words—one chapter of ten hundred words.

The goal is to get this story to the point that you really understand the book and are certain you have a strong and meaningful story that is worth telling (I don’t mean to downplay the fact that it’s only a partial book—this is just a rough draft).

This is your very first draft. It’s in the middle of your first draft where you’ll spend weeks rewriting. Don’t expect it to go quickly. It will just take longer than the other stories in the competition have gone (and it’s hard to go from a first reading straight to the next). In addition, all the stories have a long, slow start, where you need to sit with the book, slowly developing a strong perspective and narrative before you get to your story.

Start using this prompt in your story. How does the protagonist of the story find the parts? (It might be the watch’s maker or the local repair shop, the woman’s husband, or the scientist. Do you know a better one for me?) The narrative and characters are in your hands. You have a good starting point. Write.
