Once upon a time, there lived a man who had the power to bend reality to his will. This man, known simply as 'The Omnipotence', had gained his power after stealing a magical book from an old wizard.

The book seemed completely ordinary, but when The Omnipotence opened it he discovered it was filled with strange symbols and words that seemed to defy logic. Drawing upon his courage, he read the strange words and suddenly, he could bend reality to his will.

At first, The Omnipotence was overwhelmed by his newfound power. But soon, word of his abilities began to spread, and it wasn't long before people started pestering him for favors. It seemed as if everyone wanted something from him, whether it was a wish, a spell, or the ability to make something impossible happen.

The Omnipotence grew weary of the constant requests and demands placed upon him, but despite his exhaustion, he found himself unable to say no. He was forced to accept the requests, however feeble they seemed, and while his reality-bending powers got him out of a lot of jams, it also left him feeling increasingly powerless.

The Omnipotence quickly wished he had never stumbled upon the magical book. He had gained near-omnipotent power, yes, but he had also gained near-omnipresent stress. He wanted nothing more than for people to stop pestering him for favors, but it seemed that he was doomed to live a life of constant pestering and requests.
