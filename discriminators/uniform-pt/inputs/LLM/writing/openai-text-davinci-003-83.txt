Once upon a time, in a distant land, there lived a peaceful nation known throughout the world for its good-natured people and gentle way of life.

But all that peace was suddenly threatened when a new kind of enemy emerged—an unfamiliar foe that didn’t have a physical form, but rather existed as an intangible entity known as the Internet Presence, or IP.

This mysterious force seemed to be everywhere and nowhere. It had the power to cause chaos and destruction—and it did so with ease. It could warp reality and disrupt the natural order. Any and all attempts to oppose the IP seemed to end in disaster.

The king was desperate and had his royal advisers look for any means of stopping this malevolent force. The answer they came up with was to find a way to disrupt the IP’s presence in the land—but how?

Finally, the answer came in the form of two brave warriors: a warrior of light and a warrior of darkness. The two warriors were able to combine their powers to create a new form of magic, one capable of destroying the IP itself.

And, just like that, the IP was defeated and peace was restored to the kingdom once more. Though the IP’s presence is still felt all around the world, it is no longer a threat to the people of this land.
