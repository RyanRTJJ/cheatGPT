~~~ You click that link and think "Hmm, I think I would prefer more information". You write your story. There seems to be a little bit of information in my name? How could I possibly know that? I type my time of death and click "Yes No". Wow, that makes sense! I'm not really being sarcastic. I wrote a story that the Wikipedia editors thought was funny. Why can't somebody tell me more? How else do I know the difference between being a jerk and a moron? That's interesting. Does someone have to explain this? (Well, maybe an adult, but I imagine we can't have every person in our world know every word of every sentence.) How do you feel? (Oh, God, it's so hard and scary! I'm so scared too!)

It sounds very obvious but I know for the fact that this is probably the first time anyone in your life has been asked to write on wikipedia without telling you that it's true. So it fits the narrative for you, and thus it makes sense for everyone else: you're in this strange place where you seem to know all the answers to so many questions, and not enough answers. "There's no way I can even begin to answer that question!" It makes you feel as if you must be able to answer it, and so you do.

We've discussed many kinds of problems that you have written about, from being raped to not being able to believe in god. Do you feel that your experience is unique to you, or that any other experiences, stories, people have come past you as
