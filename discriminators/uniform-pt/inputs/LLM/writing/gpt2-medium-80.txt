___________________________________________________________________________ We live in a world where writers are often the only ones who know how to do their work. And that's a good thing. If you can, try to write for somebody who is a better writer than you. Make it a story about you and your characters. If you have that, you're going to have a great time.

As you progress as a writer, you'll be tempted to let your writing style come across as overly formal or boring, but it's better for those reasons to keep it short, to maintain that tone of voice, and to let your voice shine through. Even with a formal style, your writing style isn't going to grow and grow, you're going to get better from time to time. And you're going to find that those days where your writing style shines are ones you often spend reading and writing. Don't worry about your style. Don't worry about who you are because that's not what you are. Write good books. Take your writing and turn it into real art. Write for what you can get done instead of just how you want to write.
