A:

I think the idea is this:

This is the day the world ended. They died, everyone,
everything. My name is D, and I was one of them.
What was it like, I wonder? Just the way things are,
nothing really changed with the end. Except I had no
longer needed my name - I had no one to tell it to.
Now, I stand on this road, in a city that still exists - the
city from which I had been a child. All around I see the
evidence of what had happened.
[In the distance:  

 A child, sitting on a branch, looks at a girl who is looking at him] 

There's nothing else. I'm here, and this is it. 

In the trees the birds are singing to each other.
There's just my face and this moment frozen in time,
the way I remember it - a perfect, timeless picture.

There's no noise around me. I know there must be,
but I've learned to ignore it.
My eyes are tired, and everything is quiet. The
wind blows the leaves around, and that's all there is.
If I close them, I might see the world - but what's
the point, right? I wonder to myself. After all I
can't do a thing. I know this. But I have my eyes
closed and I'm just waiting, I don't want things to
end before I finish.

[Another child comes into view, and walks towards the first,
handing something to her - a flower. They hold it close.  

 Another boy is standing at the other side too, and they  greet each other.
The two children get up and run off into the woods where
the other child disappears
