### How to Use This Book

This book is broken into seven sections, each covering a different type of character. At the beginning of each subsection, you will find a list of character descriptions you can use as the base for your short story. Use those descriptions as your basis if you like. If not, make your own. Take full advantage of the information on these pages. If you're doing a crossword puzzle in one of those sections, get up and stretch a little. And feel free to skip ahead, if you'd like. But don't forget, as I'm sure you do, to put each of these characters in their appropriate world category.

In the next two chapters I'll guide you through each of these character types. In Chapters 2 and  we'll explore how to write character introductions and endings, which are key components of your story. In Chapters 3 and  we'll explore how to integrate these characters in your narrative. Chapter 4 will be devoted to dialogue between these characters. If, in the course of these two chapters, you can't decide which character to work on, the decision comes at the end of the next Chapter, where you are invited to choose both your main character and your supporting characters.

Chapter 5 will cover the different ways you can develop character traits. Chapter 6 will guide you through the various parts of making physical descriptions of objects, and in Chapter 7 I will show you how to build your story around objects from the previous two chapters.

To recap: Each chapter covers one character type by relating how to best depict each character using the descriptions in the preceding chapter. Although you can use just about any short story formulae you'd care to invent, try to follow the suggestions you get from the previous chapter in developing your own character list. You can do this simply by reading these chapters and putting your own words into the
