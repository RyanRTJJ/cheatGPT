 Don't explain what the hell it "means" just write a story that shows us that the word "nevermind" does in fact still mean something.
That's not what you're supposed to do here.
I know,  I just want to see what people come up with. If this sub really does have it's critics I'd be really surprised.
I hear you mate. I think the writing prompt system could have its issues, but it seems like a great way to force the creativity of writers.
It could definitely work. I think a lot of the criticism comes from outside of it's intended purpose.  We have to remember that everything in life has purpose,  there's no need to create drama where there is no need for it.
I don't believe what I see here. I'd like to point out that it is not hard to find writing prompts where the prompt is as simple as "write about a word you don't understand," or the prompt asks you to write a short story to try out some theme. This prompts are for the serious writers. What they *should* have done is call these prompts "write about a writing prompt you don't understand."
I see what you mean,  but I think if they had said to write a story to try out a theme they would get fewer responses. It would be a great way to get people looking at all types of writing instead of always going for what they know.
I'm not gonna lie, I think I'd have been happier with that too.
For a lot of the people here? definitely. Everyone has seen plenty of prompts that start out with "write about yourself." It's cool to be challenged but some of the prompts here are just plain bullshit.
