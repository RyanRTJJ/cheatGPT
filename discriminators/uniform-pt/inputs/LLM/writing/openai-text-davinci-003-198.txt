I've been here for as long as I can remember, going on one fantastic and daring adventure after the other. I thought I had seen and experienced it all, until one day I discovered my new ability: I was functionally immortal. I could die, yet come back to life a few moments later.

At first, this power was thrilling and gave me a new lease of life: I could take ridiculous risks and get away unscathed. But as the decades and centuries passed, I grew jaded and bored by it all. Dying was the only thing that could still create a thrill.
