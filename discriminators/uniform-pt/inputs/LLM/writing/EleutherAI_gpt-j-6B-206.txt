It was originally written for radio, and was first produced onstage in 1937. In the play, the question is asked by one of the few survivors of a failed Jewish uprising, Molly Bloom.

Molly asks if the surviving survivors should join the French troops she knows are coming by sea. There is, of course, much more to say, about the role and the meaning of her time here and her time in her husband's past and, of course, about the meaning of life.
