 (It will just be a story, not a complete scenario)
Thanks for the advice i'll keep this in mind when i create my plot.
Good luck with it! And if you don't like what I come up with just post it here and I'll go through it and see how it could go.
Thanks your help is much appreciated and i'll make note of you in case something comes up haha.
No problem! I'll probably be posting the rest of what people are posting here very soon if people are enjoying them :) (hopefully that doesn't ruin too much of the original story)
Sounds good! I already started so hopefully it goes well.
Nice! Let us know how it goes!
Well today was my first complete attempt and it did turn out ok so i'm going to continue on with my story and see what i can come with. I think it needs some rewording but hopefully it'll be okay. Thanks for all the advice and i'll let you know if anything else comes up.
Good to hear!   Don't ever feel like you have to reword anything if it doesn't need doing. Even reworking stuff that did need reworking was worth the effort.
Thanks! I really appreciate everything i've been given here. Thank you for everything!
You are welcome!! Keep up the good work!! :D
Thank you so much! Have a great day! :)
Yup same to you!  Hope it's great!  Make a post about it when it's done.
Definitely will! Thank you again. :)
You're quite welcome!! Thanks for stopping by!! :)
A pleasure! Anytime! :) And anytime you need help, don't hesitate to ask. :)
