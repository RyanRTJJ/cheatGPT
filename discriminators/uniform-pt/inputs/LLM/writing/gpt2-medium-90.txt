I wonder what the guy has written in this picture's caption. Who is the girl on top? Does she seem like a coolie or something.? And what would she like?

What does the man think he's seen?

If none of these answers are a solution, try one based on what you know of the image:

What is something strange about the man and the woman's faces at the same time? What are the differences between them?

If there is information in the image that was never mentioned in the story, include it in the comments - I can't remember every detail of every line either. Thank you!
