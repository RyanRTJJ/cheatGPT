 The first question that you want to ask will be how big the asteroid will be - how big will all that rock be?  A asteroid that weighs more than 10 times that in some of our solar system's largest deserts?  Then you need to answer the question with a big question, and you already are the target.  That is where the two most important questions come in: how big is the asteroid? How big is it? It is small, at 6 meters (8 feet.) It is big enough to destroy all our industrial infrastructure if it were hit hard enough by other solar panels... But more importantly, the giant asteroid that the world will see tomorrow... Its mass is large enough to wipe out the entire planet Earth, which is almost certainly nothing at all. And that is where the big question comes down: how big and fast will we be headed in the decades to come?  We think we have seen this once before already, by the late 3000's. However the mass of today's asteroid is small enough to block off the way to interstellar travel and take out all of the planets Earth has ever known before.  In the early 20th century all of life would have died out if only we had survived on the surface of the ocean, where life would have thrived and thrived in large numbers and had a thriving population.  We would have made it to the point where a huge crater would be formed on everything.  But life just wouldn't exist today.  Life is only on the verge of extinction, and our population will be at or near 100 times that of life as a whole.  The asteroids would all become part of this planet and could do a lot worse to the world.  So when you answer the first question "how big and fast will we be
