************************* You wake in a world without dreams and pain. There's no one to punish you for the world you live in. You spend most of the day playing video games in real time. You don't have dreams, and yet you have to cope with everything life throws at you. You realize you've been living a lie. You're living a life of constant happiness for two generations. One day, you wake up, shocked and saddened. Your parents had died in a freak plane crash five years prior, and as a result you're in no position to care for them during this time. Because of this, you spend the rest of your life living the fantasy life you wanted all along. You don't have dreams, and yet you can still dream things, dreams about your parents all you want. You wonder how your parents ended up where they are these days. You've spent the last decade trying to figure out how to make friends, and nothing has ever seemed to help. That's when you wake up in your parents' basement. You search the house, eventually finding an old journal you found during your research. The journal contains a list of things that would have been awesome if you had had the power for them to happen. The most awesome was a dream you had a few years ago where you were standing in front of your room as your parents were in an airplane. It didn't seem too far fetched to you, that one day your parents would have visited, but you were afraid that you wouldn't live to see their visits. You can't go back. You don't know how to travel, but you do know how to stay alive, and the knowledge you hold makes you stronger at the end
