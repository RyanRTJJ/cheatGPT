  Edit: also, I want to thank you for making this post, I hadn't seen it before.
Thank you!  If you could include a short excerpt of this story I would be extremely grateful.  Would be happy to post an excerpt or a link to the story once I'm finished though you don't have to if you don't feel like it.
Sure, I can start it tonight or tomorrow night if that works.
Definitely tomorrow night when you can!  Appreciate it!
Sure! I can start it in a bit now, if you want to pick it up tomorrow.
That'd be great!  Let me know when it's set so I can pick it back up.  I've been busy all day so haven't had a chance to start it myself until now.  I hope to hear your work!
I'm just going to edit this thread now and finish it. When I'm done you'll definitely get a link. I won't expect it to be the nicest thing ever, but it'll be something you at least might want to read. I'll also let you in on a trick I learned from my dad. If you ever read his, I hope you enjoy that as well.
Awesome, that's great!  I will definitely read it.  I never thought about using the trick before and hope that my writing can benefit from it.  Thanks again!
Any time, good luck. I have a bunch more, it may be better if I post them on a second thread.
That would work!  Thanks man!  Keep up the good work!
What thread would you prefer?
Just post the new one, I'm sure it won't disappear or anything!
