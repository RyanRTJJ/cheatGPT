He was not the type of man anyone expected to suddenly open up and make a confession of love. He was always so hardened and cold, it seemed impossible that he could feel any emotion besides anger or scorn.

But one day, while she was in his presence, he surprised everyone when he opened his mouth and spoke the words they didn't expect to ever hear coming out of him.

"I love you," he said, seemingly with his last breath. But his words were spat out with such hatred and bitterness, and his voice was heavy with resentment that it seemed impossible that he actually meant them.

But then, after that brief and hateful confession of his undying love, he added something that softened his utterance a bit.

"Even though I so dearly wish I didn't," he said, his voice barely a whisper.

The subject of this love was confused and overwhelmed. She had thought he had despised her for so long, yet here he was professing his undying love to her. Was this really just another act of spite from him, or was it the truth?

She didn't know what to say, so in the end, she just breathed the words out, "I love you too."

It didn't matter if it was genuine or not- she knew what he had said was the most honest, hateful, spiteful, and bitter confession of undying love she'd ever heard.
