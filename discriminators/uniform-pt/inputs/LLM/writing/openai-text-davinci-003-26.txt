Right in front of me sits an old, rusty, orange bike. The frame is slightly crooked and creaks when touched. The handlebar has a few dents and is wrapped in black electrical tape, giving it the look of a makeshift repair job. On the underside of the seat there is an old sticker from the Simon and Garfunkel album "Bridge Over Troubled Water." The seat is made up of a fine, brown leather with black and red stripes. It has been scratched and worn over the years, with numerous dirt smudges and some rust marks. The wheel spokes are made up of various rusty shades, speckled with old dirt. The rear wheel has an old, brown plastic mudguard hanging off the back, providing a bit of extra protection for the bike. The brakes are missing and the chain is loose and rattles as I wheel the bike around. It may be old and a bit rusty, but it is still functional and full of character.
