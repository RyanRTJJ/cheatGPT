The priest, the rabbi, and the minister had known each other for many years, ever since they were all ordained in the same small town. They had worked together in times of peace and in times of distress, but this was different. It was a desperate act.

They had been together at the local church earlier that day, discussing the rise in poverty, the increase in crime, and the effects of poverty on the community. As they pondered the next steps to take, they all felt a sense of hopelessness. After all, the resources were limited and the circumstances seemed insurmountable.

So, for the first time, the three stepped into a bar. This was no jokeâ€”it was a tragedy. They sat down, not to drink and splash away their sorrows, but to raise a glass to a situation that seemed to have already trampled on the hope that the three men had sought to provide to their flock.

They lifted their glasses to the heavens and said a prayer. They thanked the Lord for having brought them together, for having brought them this far, for having given them the courage to go into this place, and for the hope that things will get better.

The three men drank in silence, but there was an air of camaraderie. The tragedy had brought them together in a way they never imagined, and through that tragedy, they had found strength in each other.
