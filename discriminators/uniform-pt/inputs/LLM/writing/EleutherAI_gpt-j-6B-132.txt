_____________________________ What are five things that helped you to feel warm, calm, or joyful?

The prompt for this week's Monday Meme, is "Tell me four things..." and I want you to just write the four things without worrying about the prompt. If you want to, you could share them with me later, but that's not how it's going to work for this week.

This is a picture prompt - the image below doesn't have any particular story but it will get you started. The picture is of two children playing in a meadow. One sits down, the other climbs up a tree, the first picks blueberries from a bush.

What's happening in the scene? Why is this picture happening in your mind?

Write the answer in the space below.

_____________________________

I want you to just write, for fun or just not worrying about the prompt and for fun, write a story based on this scene, as well as write a sentence, or a paragraph, a short list of what the child was thinking or feeling in the scene.

Last week's prompt was: "I'm going to tell you five of my favorite things..." I want you to start with one thing, and then use the week to tell me five more things, in order.

You might have one favorite thing, your cat or your dog or a favorite place, a favorite color, or an old poem. Just write those things above now.

_____________________________

Write a sentence or write a paragraph or whatever, just write about your favorite thing or things for this week, and then add in another thing this week, your second favorite thing or things and so on, listing each thing, in order this week, each thing being your favorite things.

I'll see about coming up with a prize for this. I'm looking for a good item to give away... one that you might have in your home, or want to buy.

Here's a list of things that might happen
