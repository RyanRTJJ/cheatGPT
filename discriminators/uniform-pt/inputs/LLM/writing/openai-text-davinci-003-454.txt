An ancient evil looms over the world,
No soul had the power to unfurl.
For deep in the abyss,
A powerful darkness persists,
A cosmic entity from beyond our realm.

No creature had ever set it free,
But something odd did catch our glee.
For there an old man with white hair,
Lurked around in strange air.
A wise soul from another realm.

He spoke of an ancient, majestic shrine,
Hidden away deep in our time.
He told of a creature so dreaded and feared,
But no one near had heard.

We knew he spoke of a figure of dread,
That had been dormant in slumber since time began.
Yet the old man spoke the truth,
For somewhere deep, best left forgotten,
The cosmic horror was alive once again.

We ventured into the shadows,
To face the looming danger,
The terror that laid in wait,
Yet never had we been more astray,
For the creature we sought was not at all what we expected.

For the cosmic horror was no monster,
But a thing of beauty and charm.
It begged us to understand,
That we must accept its form,
Or the whole of the world would be cloaked in harm.

Hushed in a whisper, it uttered a plea,
To accept its form, for the greater good of all.
We had no choice but to try and reason,
For in our hearts, we knew that it was right,
We must accept this cosmic being, or face the end of our days in night.
