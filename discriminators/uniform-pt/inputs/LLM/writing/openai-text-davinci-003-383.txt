Their eyes met and there was a moment of silence. It seemed like an eternity before he finally spoke.

"I wish you were dead," he said, his voice strained and filled with emotion.

The tension in the air was palpable. She wanted to run away and hide, curl up in a ball and cry. But she remained in the spot, in front of him, and replied, her voice shaking with barely contained tears.

"No, I wish you were alive," she said and her voice seemed to have an infinite echo.

He smiled sadly, tears now forming in his eyes. He stepped forward and embraced her. 

"I am alive, at least for now, and so are you," he whispered into her hair. "That's all that really matters."

The two of them stayed like that for a few minutes, letting emotions come and dissipate, until he finally broke the silence. 

"I'm sorry," he said. "I don't ever want you to feel like you need to die. You're too valuable and unique."

She smiled, tears streaking down her cheeks as she buried her face in his chest. 

"I'm so sorry," she choked out. "I didn't mean it, I was just so angry."

"I know. We all get angry, it's ok," he said, brushing away her tears. 

The two of them stood, intertwined in an embrace, both content to just be in each other's presence. No more words were necessary, just the embrace and the knowledge that they were both here, alive and together.
