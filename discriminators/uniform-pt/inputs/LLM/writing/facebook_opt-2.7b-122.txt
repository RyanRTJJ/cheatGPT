  You see them again and there is something familiar about them. You talk about the old days and how much you miss them. The theme music from your childhood plays and that's when it strikes you.   You grew up during the same year as them.
that is incredibly brilliant. That actually sounds like a good short story. I'm going to think about it for the next couple days. I don't know if this is a good idea for anything, but the story is just good enough that I think I can work with it. If I put it in this sub, will you give it a read?
As long as I'm interested, I'll read it. I'm an English teacher.   Good luck.
That's really sweet of you! I'm in high school, so I doubt a story's age would be a problem, it would be like a year or two ago. My english teacher has also recommended, but I wasn't sure if that was because he has so much time on his hands or what. Regardless, I guess I'll try to write it out tomorrow and PM you in the morning! Wish me luck.
Alright, no problem.   Good luck. Have fun.
Thank you! I will post the story tomorrow! Wish me luck.
It needs work, but I don't actually think you're doing a bad job. Just find a way to work them out. The premise sounds good. I don't know if you could make a short story out of this but I would read it if you did.
Thank you so much for your opinion, I really appreciate it! I will certainly consider your criticism, and if I manage to make this a short story, I'll be sure to let you know. Thank you again!
