Here's how I would do it (though I would probably change what I wrote - the door opening is not very dramatic and a real ghost could go into a normal house and find this thing):

 Imagine you live in a house that has a basement. The door you write about is to an old tool room. It is not a part of the house you live in. Imagine that the house is about 100 years old. You find  the door, and you know this is a door people have been trying to fix for a long time. That's all!

 You are in a friends' house, talking together. You talk about what a friend has been wondering about. He knows you are from the supernatural world, and is not afraid to share what he thinks about something.

 You are sitting on your front steps, waiting for your friend's friend. He comes over, and you ask the question and the friend tells him he should
