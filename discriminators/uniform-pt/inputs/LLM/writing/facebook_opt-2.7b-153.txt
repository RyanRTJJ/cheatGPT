  I'd appreciate if you sent a screenshot of the story so I know if I want to read it.
It wouldnt be very happy  Its more like my whole life is this one moment.  And I'd love for you to read it once you do.
What would a happy ending be? Would it be like the end of high school where everyone gets together and sings kumbaya and cries together until the end?
You mean as we all just die and then all the dead people come back to life as zombies?
I think a more philosophical, philosophical ending would be something like "the world ended because people decided there would be no god, and for whatever reason he didn't like it so he started making the world disappear into thin air" or he made the world disappear because people created religions. If you can come up with a more fitting ending this is still something I would read!   I'm interested!
I tried to. I tried to put all that in there. And it was basically   I wish that I knew when life was over and could choose how I'd want the world to end.   But after a few people pointed out that's a shitty way to end the world I gave up.  Its just a stupid way for me to do it.
Oh, yeah you can definitely just ignore me, then. I'm just interested in what would actually happen in your story. It would be interesting to follow these characters for a while! Sorry if this sounded pushy or anything, I'm just really interested in your world.
No its not that at all.   I really, really appreciate you wanting to read it. The fact that someone is actually interested in putting effort into something so silly that i posted on the internet warms my heart.   Sorry again. I was just having a really down day and needed something to do. Now that I've gotten some feedback I'll try to fix this.
