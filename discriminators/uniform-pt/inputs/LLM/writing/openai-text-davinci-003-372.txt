The sun was beating down upon the beach as if signaling a day of celebration instead of a day of mourning. Today was a day of both, it the last day of the ocean's waves.

The people of the beach had known this day was coming, but no one could have predicted the sadness that had brought everyone together. Tourists and locals alike, all dressed in white and holding candles, gathered around the water's edge.

As the sun set, a light breeze blew across the beach, carrying the salty smell of the ocean, as if the sea was saying goodbye. Tears streamed from the eyes of all present, as they looked out across the vast expanse of the sea, barely moving now that the waves were gone.

After a few minutes of silent mourning, the people began to sing, the haunting melody of their cries echoing in the night. As their song carried across the beach, their candles were lit one by one, and together, their flickering flames lit up the darkness.

Though the ocean no longer had waves, it still held the memories of days gone by and the hope of days to come. On this day, and every day after, the people will continue to keep the ocean in their hearts, never forgetting the last day that the ocean had waves.
