 (Your story could also be about anything that happens during the blackout: the shutdown of a city, a storm, an earthquake) 
Submission Deadline: Friday October 31st, 9:00 PM PST
Author Notes 1.  I cannot emphasize enough just how much work and responsibility is involved in writing a story here.  It's a huge challenge; something that I am confident will pay off well in the near future.
And just to give you some pointers on what to put in your Author Notes:
Make sure your story is based in the real world
Get to "know" your character
Tell your story from a character's point of view
Keep that in mind and I hope you enjoyed this week's challenge!  I have some more coming soon but I will keep a list handy for you to just in case. Happy writing!

P.S.  If your story isn't ready for this challenge yet that's OK, it isn't meant to be, at least not at first. You get the idea; you've been put in a tricky spot and it's only by working with it over time that you can learn how to make it work.  (And to be clear just because you've got your Author Notes open for your story doesn't mean you're allowed to post it or try to sell your story.  Trust me, we all know how bad that has gone.  In my last story here I was going to charge money (as we always do on the blog, but there was a little extra twist that would make the process super simple and painless.)  But after writing it a few times and then posting it, I realized that it was a really good story; I can't even stress that enough.  And by the next week I'm going to start writing it more for fun, and then at some point I'm going to re-evaluate for this challenge and decide whether I should charge or not.)
