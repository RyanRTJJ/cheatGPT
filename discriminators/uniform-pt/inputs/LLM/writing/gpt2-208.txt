The family of an American journalist kidnapped in Guatemala in 1977 will receive a memorial that represents "America's greatest sacrifice" and will honor Mr. Zemel, the American whose death will begin at about 4:30 p.m. today.
Dr. Zemel made his home. He was the last person alive, as a reporter with USA Today in 1977, to go missing the following October of that year.  The day after his disappearance, he vanished while covering Guatemala's uprising. As the day wore on, Zemel was found with his face and head in a pool of blood, dead or otherwise. A second body, identified as Mr. Zemel II, was found. His remains may not be in his body... well, at least not at this moment. It's possible his death was caused, or a result of, CIA torture -- as had happened with Dr. Ben Rhodes -- although as far as I know they weren't linked to the CIA and CIA agents.  
Dr. Rhodes, a renowned American political scientist who served as director of the National Security Council, had previously claimed Dr. Zemel's story was very much based on his own experiences while covering Guatemalan affairs.  Indeed, from a CIA point of view, the alleged "smoking gun" he concocted in 1976 was a CIA official who has repeatedly denied involvement with the assassination of the American journalist Zemel to date.  What I now believe is that Dr. Rhodes was more in tune with the CIA's official views - that American journalist Zemel might not have been able to bring the news about the abduction of Dr. Zemel back in 1974 into the national interest without CIA cooperation -- that he must have worked on a cover-up that could have saved America's reputation.  He was only a very tiny part of the large number of Guatemalan journalists known as "the journalists who fell in love with the CIA" which was the CIA. That was it in 1980, at some point. Now, let me reiterate that Dr. Rhodes was never a CIA official and
