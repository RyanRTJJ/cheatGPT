_______________________________________________ I hope you enjoyed the short story! Next is the short story about the other students, and our first kiss. This may be a bit of a different style; I'm trying something new here - I'm not really doing my best in writing romantic stories this time around! Please let me know if there are any problems and I'll try my best to remedy them! If you have any suggestions on how I could improve this story or even ways to make it more fluffy, please tell me! *cough* Anyways, next is "Pupils of Light and Darkness", the story of how one of our school's best minds, Professor Zax, was able to find the way to unite the light and the dark with the power of science! Check it out at: http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9667828/1/Pupils-of-Light-and-Darkness So, we've got two stories here, so that left us with two more. Hope you are as excited as we are (and maybe even a little jealous, but hopefully not). We're finally ending things with one short story and one long story - two story lines that won't be ending anytime soon. This is why the title for the story is "One Light and Two Dark". It'll be a two part story, featuring the last story of the season (and probably the last story I write - for now). I'll try my best to keep it short and sweet. I might add some more stories into this short story short story series - if I have time. But for now I think we're done! Here's the link to the next story, which is "The Mystery of Pupils of Light and Darkness". It's also on Fanfiction.net - if you want to check it out! <3 -Wes A.
