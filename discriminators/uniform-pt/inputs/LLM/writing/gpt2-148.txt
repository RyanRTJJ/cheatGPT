______________________________________________________________________________ When you give a story a lead, you decide which direction a story should be centered. Don't give a story an ending but focus more on what's important. When you're writing, you start over with characters with big stories that span different cultural contexts. That way, you don't have to worry about finding a bad ending to your tale based on context. When you're doing that story-writing, consider setting the main plot in the "big" setting of "the other world." ______________________________________________________________________________ The other thing about the story writing is that all the characters are the same. They're different in appearance, mood, skin tone, and even voice. It's pretty neat to be certain what your characters voice, but it will be an important part of the writing in the rest of the book. ______________________________________________________________________________ The "bad" ending might show up in my book. It might be that I don't see why a hero is there. Maybe I'm overusing the idea because I don't want to be read that way. Perhaps I've forgotten that I'm writing the story and writing about real people. When I'm writing a story I look for something that makes it real. When I'm writing a story I start with the story about a guy and a girl in an abandoned ship. That's the best ending. I want to see what happens to a character after hearing his or her story. It is a story about three girls with different personalities and that is a story for me. Not to make it too easy for readers, but they will all be interesting to read. Now, I hope this guide helps you think of what works and what doesn't in your story. It is also a big help to make sure there are other settings for my hero and princess to go over, and if they are here to live and be together. You may also be wondering
