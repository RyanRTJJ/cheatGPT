It was the most wonderful time of the year, and all of the children around the world were beginning to compile their Christmas wish lists. Dyslexic children, whose differences often made them feel isolated from the rest of their peers, felt some relief in exercising the same holiday customs.

Unbeknownst to their parents, eight-year-old Sarah and seven-year-old David had decided to write letters to Satan in lieu of a holy figure, as though he might be able to understand their struggles better. After all, one couldn't get an easier address than "666 Hell Street".

Upon opening their letters during the holiday season, their surprise was too great to contain. Within each one of the letters was an admission of guilt, an apology, and a list of intricate wishes. To the children's surprise, Satan had written back within days.

In the subsequent letters they received, they found personal congratulatory messages addressed directly to them and deals made to fulfill their Christmas wishes. Although the presents weren't what Santa would have brought, Sarah and David found them to be satisfactory, as well as oddly appropriate.

Their peers soon found out, and curiously envious of the mystery gifts Sarah and David had received. While most of the children were too scared to put pen to paper, their luck seemed to be the start of a new trend.

Dyslexic children all around the world began to write their wishes to Satan, hoping for the same luck Sarah and David had experienced. To the children's dismay, Satan always responded.
