Bashir dived for cover as soon as he heard the first explosion. Fragments of the crumbling buildings rained down around him, plunging him into darkness. He was just 13, yet old enough to run frantically in search of his family, only to end up trapped in the debris of his once home.

Bashir thought he was alone, but in the haze of dust he could make out a figure. The figure drew nearer and Bashir could see the faces of a soldier towering over him. It was impossible to tell what side he belonged to in this war-torn city, but bits of his uniform hinted at a military association.

Before Bashir had a chance to find out, the ground began to rumble with the approaching thud of bombs. As the bombs began to drop, the soldier took hold of Bashir, wrapping an arm around him and pulling him close.

"It's ok, I'm here to help," The soldier shouted over the commotion.

Bashir felt a sudden peace as the soldier assured him that everything would be OK. He was no longer alone, protected by a stranger in a time of chaos.

And then the world erupted with fire, debris, destruction... yet through it all, he felt safe.
