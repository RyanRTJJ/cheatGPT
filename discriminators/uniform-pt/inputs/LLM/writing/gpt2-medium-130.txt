_____ The seas are rising. The mountains are changing. Water can never stay put in the same place in every place. _____ ____ _____ _____ _____ _____ ______________ In February, the weather is not the kind of show you think most people would be able to stand watching. There is some talk of a tornado. The world will be flooded. People who live far away will have to evacuate. The U.S. will be plunged into a disaster with far greater frequency than the Great Depression. Yet not one person seems rattled by the weather. You go out into the world every day without concern. It's routine, it goes away quickly. When in doubt or confusion, the TV you watch has something to provide. The air conditioners, your gas, your Internet connectionâ€”everything is there. Why should weather affect you so much? We are lucky to live at a time when climate affects much more. We spend our lives at the edge of our environment, and at times it is difficult to feel secure about the world around us. We are able to absorb weather, and sometimes even better, we get it right. So, why isn't the weather as important to us as the weather affects anyone else around us? Not all of us will find ourselves completely cut off from electricity or water, the ability to go anywhere or do anything for most of a day. Weather is important to life. It moves everything that we do, from food to housing, for sure. The more we depend on it, the more it moves. Even weather on TV is crucial. For all the media frenzy surrounding weather in February, it is important. For the viewers and viewers who don't see it, it's important to the people who do. Let's be clear about the relationship between weather and life. Weather is important to life.  ___ _____ _____ _____ _____ ____ _____ Earth has gained a fifth season. The season of the ocean.
