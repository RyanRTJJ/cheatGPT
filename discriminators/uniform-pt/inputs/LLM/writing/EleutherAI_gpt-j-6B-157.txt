What happened to the Axis Powers? Who won? Who lost? Who got what? What did they gain? What did they lose to?

A:

I think I would call the Third World War lost for the Allies.
As it would probably happen now, the United States and NATO might have taken over the Americas from the Axis. Russia and the People's Republic of China would be their allies, and possibly Russia would have gained parts that were formerly occupied by the former Soviet Union, namely Poland and Slovakia.
The People's Republic of China's government has a history of claiming to liberate lands taken from the Chinese by Western invaders, so perhaps the PRC would take an interest in these territories in the future.
It would be interesting to see if Eastern Europe is still in the American control. The Soviet military-industrial complex might help in that.
All that would happen, though, would be after a peace treaty has been signed, so it's too early to say anything. 

 The Allies would have a new world order, but if the US and NATO remain strong, there's no way the US is going to have the same kind of power as it had pre-war, especially after having seen how the Nazi war machine was strong on Europe and weak on America. As such, the US would be far behind Russia/China both in military strength and technology. So who knows, but something like this could happen in a few decades.

 Also interesting that the Pacific campaign would have gone differently: Japan would have the Philippines (which would be a new country), Japan's former colonies in the Pacific (Korea, Taiwan, and all the rest of them, including Manchuria, and most of the South China Sea), and Indonesia all under it's rule. The Allies would have lost their last major Asian colonies to them.
