......................................................................... #16. What is a Furry? How do I say "Furry"? I know, confusingly. I don't know... but it sounds so cute like I'm trying to say it! Do I have to say "human" as well? Well, I don't know! The word "furry" is one word. In other words, it can describe a human -- or animal -- whose name ends in "furry" but in a different way than your other words. For instance, there's a furry who sings, dance, holds their arms out and lets themselves go. That's Furry on my face. Well, then, furry is a word. Here's how you start using it. Furry = Feline = Fur(or Fur) * Cat Furry - refers to any of the following: human or animal with the facial features of a cat;

animals whose ears and fangs appear much longer and wider than normal humans;

fur-covered dogs and cats;

hairy, wolf-like mammals of nonhuman origin;

animal species in the range of a rhinoceros;

animals that are smaller in size than human children. (Also known as "mollusks.") I understand why the term was designed in this order -- it's a convenient order. If you write "fox furs" instead, your readers will be able to refer to a mouse furling who's smaller than a dog?

This list does not include any English words and we're going to use some languages. I'm sure there are others but I wanted to bring some things up as we go. All languages use the Latin alphabet. Here are the other terms people use when they discuss their languages: Latin * - A short English suffix that sounds like "l" * - A Latin word that means "the" * - An Americanization * -
