There was a sense of dread in the air as people talked about the upcoming presidential election. People's hopes for a better future rested on this one outcome, but nobody was sure who had the upper hand. Little did the people know, a prophecy from the powerful prophet known as the Oracle of Fate had been revealed, warning of an impending nuclear apocalypse unless drastic changes were made.

The Oracle declared that to avoid the destruction of all life on earth, the people must believe in and elect a seemingly ridiculous candidate. Desperate and desperate and fearing the worst, people across the nation started experimenting with candidates that seemed unelectable by traditional standards. Little did the people know, the Oracle had the perfect candidate in mind and no one else could measure up.

As election day drew near, the people found themselves in a difficult position. On one hand, they wanted to take the Oracle's prophecy seriously, but on the other hand, they feared the ridicule of electing such a crazy candidate for president. Fortunately for them, it was too late to turn back, and as the horrible news of nuclear armageddon loomed ever closer, the people had no choice but to cast their ballots for the unknown, potentially ridiculous candidate.

Once the votes were in, people couldn't believe it.Nobody expected the unknown candidate to win but here it was, the people had taken the Oracle's prophecy seriously and chose to act upon it. To everyone's surprise, the nation had elected for president the most talented, most inspiring, and most capable leader of all time. The people realized that despite the risk, it was only through taking a chance on a seemingly ridiculous candidate that they could save their world from imminent destruction. From that day forward, the people never doubted the Oracle's words again.
