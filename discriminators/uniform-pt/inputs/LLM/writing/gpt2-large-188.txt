 You do not realize that the symbol upon it is actually a heart, and you suspect that it's been modified by magic to manifest certain emotions that the ring may not be aware of.
What happens when you try to put this power into use?
It changes. The ring senses both your thoughts and emotions, a trait that can be very powerful. It can then change its own form, and manifest these new emotions to people who it doesn't expect or want.
It's not hard to imagine, really – imagine an army of emulsified spirits fighting off a horde of undead. It might not be quite so clear to the eyes, but the essence of life and death is there, and it's fighting to be manifest on your face.
What's it like being immortal?
The ring doesn't exist outside you. It's only you, in some subtle sense, it could say.
You don't feel you lose your immortality as a result of this power – so long as you're not around. It's also not a real, corporeal force like that of a ring of shadows or similar. You're not bound by any physical body. You don't wake up to a world of dark and dreary grey and become a vampire.
It seems like I need a little clarification there, actually – some of the stories suggest that the ring is literally a part of your body, a creature within you. I'm just asking for a little more information.  Is it truly part of you, or is it just something you got?
It is part of you.
It's more than just a power. It's a part of you. It's just the reflection of your current emotional state.
What's the name of the place?
It's not really important.
What comes before it in the list?
Haven't really seen much yet, since I haven't had much time to play it yet.
How do I take the power? Do I have to go into the ring while I'm already inside?
No. You can just take it from you. I didn't want it to be necessary to say as much, though,
