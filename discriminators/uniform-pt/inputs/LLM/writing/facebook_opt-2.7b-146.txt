I like this idea. Give the devil all the things he asks for so he agrees. It never works out in your favor because of the way the devil works
You have just invented a new genre of horror movie called "The Devil's Snare."
It’s a very old literary trope, but it’s been done before so in my opinion that makes it new. Good idea though, for a movie.
I know it's a literary trope. I have just never seen it used in a horror movie.
I guess that’s a fair point. I wish I could come up with a new one. Maybe like a horror comedy?
A comedy horror would be awesome. Like a scene where a group of people are going to see a horror movie but they find out what the movie's going to be before going to see it. They change their minds and decide to watch something else. Then the movie begins and they have to continue watching to the end with the audience.
Yes yes! I like this!
I can't promise how good the movie would be, but I love seeing your ideas on here. Good luck!
Thank you sir or madam. I’ll stop by your site when I’m not on mobile. Your writing always make me laugh.
You're welcome to visit, but it makes me a little sad to see mobile users on here. I wish there was more that I could do about that. Thank you for the kind words. I'm glad that you enjoy this site.
I don’t have a smartphone so I just use Reddit on a computer. I get a little sad too, but I’m glad I found something I really like. I know a few friends do use Reddit on phones and it’s so annoying to read
