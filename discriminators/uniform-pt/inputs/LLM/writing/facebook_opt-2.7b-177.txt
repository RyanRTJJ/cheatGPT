 See which is more interesting.
But how would we know which one is more interesting.
Ask a literary researcher. They're the experts in this.   Really, however the question is framed, this prompt can't help but be both interesting and confusing... for those with literary sensibilities. Like me. :)
I guess this would be very academic. Is there an easy way for my English teacher to read a story and tell me how to write it?
There are easy ways - just get her to read yours and find what she doesn't like. Write it over again - but don't change any of it. If she doesn't like what you've written, then this might teach you about what to avoid. This will also show you what a "flawed" story really is like.  Or, start writing something else and try her approach on that.
Thanks, but I guess that is what I am getting at, and I will have to just practice and write and write (if that makes any sense?)
Practice makes perfect!  You can always practice on a dummy, if you have to.  What do you consider yourself to know about writing stories?
Like how to write dialogue, character development, plot, etc. and I do write stories that are not perfect and yet I continue to write them and they seem to get read, but they also don't seem to be as popular as my stories that are flawless.
Do you do formal critique? You can do that by writing a few crappy stories and then one well-done one.  Then you can do some formal critique of "bad" stories. It's hard to improve unless you recognize the problem.  If you're not ready for formal critique, you can work on writing style and formatting, grammar and so on. There are tons of resources online.
Yeah, I write reviews for people. I think I can do well with these things and it would come natural to me.
If you have a good ear for dialogue and character development, maybe you could try writing a novel of sorts
