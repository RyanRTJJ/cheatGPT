 Also, what is their relationship like in relation to this story?
The relationship to the story is similar to most. This isn't the first time they've met, and they get along well. She is also his roommate. They share a bedroom, and the only time he ever has any trouble sleeping is at night, and sometimes even that isn't really his fault. He thinks she is a great friend and loves hanging out with her.
Is this a one time occurrence, or a new thing you're considering?
Just once. We both like girls, but we're in a long distance relationship and don't have the opportunity to meet up very often.
You've already got your answer, but let me just add: it's not for lack of love. If this girl doesn't see a future together with you, she won't push you to pursue her when there are so many other girls that will.  As far as the long distance thing goes, talk to her and be honest, but also be firm. "If we met in person, I'd be all over you. But because we don't that's not the case. I understand if you no longer feel the same." And leave it at that.
This doesn't strike me as an honest question. This is a way to ask "Are you not attracted to me because I'm not someone living close by?"  She'd need the person he's sleeping with to say something to her.
But he's asking her if they have a chance of being together, he's not asking what's her problem with him or why she didn't want him to be her first choice. If anything, her statement could be used as leverage by saying he likes other girls so that should prove that there's no possibility.
I doubt anyone asking to be put on the spot like this, let alone in a question thread, has something to prove that would prove a point.
