Alice loved the fair- the bright lights, the loud sounds, the smell of freshly cooked food, and the wide assortment of rides. Her favorite was the Ferris wheel- it was a thrilling ride, yet calming and peaceful at the same time.

Every year on her birthday, Alice's parents would take her to the fair, ensuring she had a memorable experience as she celebrated another year of life. As Alice got off the Ferris wheel, the ride operator- Jack- waved her over. He had been operating the ride for years and had watched Alice grow up over the years, coming to the fair to experience the ride and chat with him.

Jack had developed a special bond with Alice, as if he were her grandfather. Every year he eagerly looked forward to the fair, hoping to see the beautiful, young girl come through the gate with a smile on her face. On her 17th birthday, Alice seemed sad and distant. Jack noticed a change and asked her what was wrong. Tears filled her eyes as she told him her parents had gotten divorced and she no longer felt as excited about the fair as she used to.

Jack took Alice's hand in his and smiled. He reminded her that no matter how much her world changed, the Ferris wheel would always be there for her as it had been for so many years. Jack had seen her grow from a little girl to a young woman, and reminded her that no matter what, he would always be here to give her a welcome hug and share in a special moment with her.

Alice smiled and hugged Jack tightly. She was reminded that even in times of darkness, the little moments of joy such as her experience on the Ferris wheel meant so much more.
