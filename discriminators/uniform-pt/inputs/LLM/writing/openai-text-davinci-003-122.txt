Once upon a time there was a world through the eyes of a baby. The vibrant colors of the world were brighter and more distinct than any other eyes could see. Every little thing was a marvel to the baby and each discovery made was one of pure joy.

Each morning the baby awoke, ready to explore a new world and all the sights it had to offer. Everywhere the baby looked was something new, from the birds singing in the trees to the bright sun shining down from the sky. If the baby smiled, it was like the whole world smiling back.

The baby never seemed to tire, but instead was eager to learn and explore and experience every little thing in the world. And as the weeks, months and years passed, the baby's eyes opened wider and wider, taking in the beauty of the world and collecting memories along the way.

The baby was rarely sad and often experimented with new things and surrounded herself with love and the warmth of family and friends. Nothing was ever too hard to learn and the world was a wondrous place to explore.

Throughout time, the baby's vision of the world never changed- every color and feeling was seen as a blessing, never taken for granted. And as the years passed, the baby kept growing and learning and exploring, always with a bright and cheerful light in her eyes, eager to discover the world through her own eyes.
