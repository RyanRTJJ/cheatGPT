Episode: 02 "A Tale of Two Sisters" -- It is Friday. After a long and restless night at the hotel, you've had enough. When you arrive home, you discover one of your family members has gone missing. You run to the neighbor's house and tell her what has happened. The neighbor finds out this doesn't match up with everyone else's and realizes that one of your sisters has been murdered! Can she save all the girls, even if it takes some sacrifices? In the wake of the killing, a group of angry people who know who murdered your sister come together in a meeting. The meeting is about to start, and it will go wrong! But can one new hope bring all the sisters back to safety? That was the end of an eight-episode arc, and that will be the very last episode I'm telling you about.
