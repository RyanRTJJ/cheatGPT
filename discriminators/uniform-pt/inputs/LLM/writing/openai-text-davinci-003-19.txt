In a world of music and possibility, a new era of magic dawned. All were astonished to learn that this powerful force could be channeled with music. With the power of music, humankind had finally unlocked the secrets of wizardry and magic.

Soon afterward, the nations of the world quietly dissolved, replaced with new countries divided by the preferred music of their people. To the north, the heavy beats of metal music called to the warriors of frost, who declared their allegiance with the Metal kingdoms. To the south, the soulful melodies of rhythm and blues sang to the people of heat, founding the countries of Soul.

Though the world was divided, music yet provided a link between them all. Travelers between realms brought with them the tunes of their own kingdom, allowing them to dance and mingle freely with the new music of their hostsâ€™ lands.

Though the world had been forever changed, music remained a source of wonderment and connection. From the deep forests of Jazz to the snow-capped peaks of Classical, new and exciting sounds promised to fill the air until the end of days.
