Once upon a time, humanity was living its everyday life in a state of routine and contentment. Little did they know, what they thought was reality was not what it appeared to be. The universe was actually a highly sophisticated simulation, the product of a powerful advanced civilization. 

One day, humanity unraveled this truth, much to their shock and disbelief. Disillusioned and angry they set out to determine who had created this simulated reality that they had been living in. 

After some investigative work, they uncovered who was behind the simulation -- a very advanced, highly intelligent race far beyond their own technological capabilities. Enraged, humanity decided to go on a mission to spite the civilization that had created the universe around them.

Their mission became to disrupt, interfere, and ultimately wreak havoc on the lives of those in charge of the simulation. Some members hacked away at the data and coding of the simulation, forcing the creator-civilization to put much resource into fixing the holes they were finding. Others subtly caused chaos through spurring social and political unrest, creating nations and organizations that were polarizing and on the brink of civil war and revolt.

Ultimately, after many years of living in turmoil and strife, the backlash of humanity's efforts became too much even for the advanced civilization and they were forced to shut down the simulation altogether. Humanity had won and declared a victory, but it was a bittersweet one as they were lost in a void of uncertainty as they said their goodbyes to the universe they had called home.
