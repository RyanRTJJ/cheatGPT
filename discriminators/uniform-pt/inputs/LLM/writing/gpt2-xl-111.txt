 How long can you keep this up? (Please use any format you'd like for this story.)
For better or worse, this is an ongoing series. I want to give my readers some of the best fics on the Net, and I take good care of my creations. Please don't take your work for granted - check back, and stay awhile - I am looking forward to seeing you, and I hope you will stay with me forever (though I may kill you by reading this story).  Be sure to check back soon to see a new story daily, at least until I reach a chapter of this story I have to quit writing.
Please remember that you can PM me with questions, comments, or complaints. Also I read everyone who comments, even those who are trolls.  Feel free to add me, though.  My e-mail - ggstory - will always be available.  Feel free to look through my work.  I appreciate your feedback.
Thanks.  -Travis

I'm thinking I do my
