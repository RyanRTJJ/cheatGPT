I got this as a gift for christmas when I was 9-a month, the watch doesn't work, or was never sold, so as soon as I got it I could not get it, or any of my other gifts were broken.

It's actually beautiful because it doesn't really move; it's just a solid case holding the strap and this watch will never change. And this last thing is worth noting - I was not at the event where the watch was purchased. This story was taken out of order because the first thing I sent a couple months later was a photograph of the watch. Just to prove I didn't have any idea what I was talking about. So, what can you do with such a perfect piece? Well, as I've alluded to before there are a few options (none that are particularly neat for me) which have not worked for me. So, here are my tips on the best method.

A: Find something you like. I would recommend getting something if you can pick up the watch. What I mean by that is a simple timepiece like I'm wearing. I don't really need someone explaining to me what to get for Christmas - I already have the watch and the watch is great as-is. But when you have a watch with a lot more functionality, it's worth doing, and this will also allow the watch to be exchanged for another perfect watch that it isn't, just like how the watch is still owned...if it gets changed there, you know what to get.

B: Don't make every purchase that could go wrong - there's not really any harm in buying something of value as long as it doesn't fail. I buy items like keys or watches because I don't make any mistakes, and if something went wrong then I could just
