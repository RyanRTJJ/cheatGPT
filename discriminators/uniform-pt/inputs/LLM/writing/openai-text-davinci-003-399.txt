Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sarah. She was a bright and curious girl, eager to explore the world around her. One day she decided to take a walk in the nearby forest. 

Sarah walked deeper and deeper into the forest, admiring the beauty of the lush greenery. As she ventured further, something dark and sinister seemed to hang in the air. She felt a chill run down her spine and her heart began to beat faster. Despite the fear she felt, Sarah was determined to continue her exploration. 

Suddenly, she heard a strange noise. It sounded like somebody or something was trying to get her attention. Sarah slowly walked towards the sound, her heart pounding with excitement and fear. Eventually, she arrived at a clearing and saw an old, run-down cottage.

The cottage looked eerie and deserted, but Sarah decided to take a closer look. She cautiously opened the door and stepped inside. She was shocked to find the cottage was filled with all sorts of magical objects! There were brightly colored potions, magical books, and sparkling gems. 

The further she explored, the more Sarah started to believe that somebody magical was living in the cottage. She quickly ran outside and saw an old woman walking down the path. She looked like a witch, with a big pointed hat and a long, black cloak. 

The old woman smiled at Sarah and said, "I see you've found my cottage. Would you like to come inside and learn some magic?"

Sarah was overjoyed and eagerly nodded her head. From that day forward, Sarah and the old woman, who was really a witch, became great friends and Sarah soon became a master of magic!
