 The way that everyone uses their powers is a big part of that.  The biggest reason why there is such an awful lot of misunderstanding about the power of the hero system is that they mostly only use power to prevent harm, or simply to keep it off of their opponents.  The powers used for their own use or to help a protagonist's story are far more significant.  In addition to preventing a hero from doing that, they prevent the villain from doing it because they're just getting rid of him.  The villains get a lot of people killed for no good reason, because they're looking to destroy all things that the heroes consider virtuous. The first story in my class ran for 10 days and it's been extremely difficult, but the characters really got it.  We are all very confused by these situations, and it's very difficult to understand why a hero might pull the trigger when someone is on the verge of being killed.  There are lots of ways that you can try to stop a murderer, but none of them are effective.  But the way that the characters of course handle these situations is by using their gifts to improve the situation.  The people who really understand that they can achieve what they need in such a situation are often called villains, but not necessarily to their credit.  We rarely hear those who see this as heroes making their lives better because it's actually meant to be like heroes are making theirs better. Instead, the most common explanation is that they are simply putting the onus on the villain to commit more crimes, and that villains do not have the power to stop a hero from committing them.  As an example of using power properly and clearly, I'm going to focus upon the situation of a former superhero named Rachael.  She lost her magic
