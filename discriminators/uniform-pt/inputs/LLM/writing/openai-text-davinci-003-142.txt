The man knew he hadn't long to live. Sitting in his hospital bed in the aftermath of his surgery, a precursor to the cancer that would eventually take his life, he consulted the clock on the wall. Twenty minutes. His heart sank. Here he was, alone and without any family or friends to help find comfort in his final moments.

The man knew what he wanted most—a cigarette. Against all better judgement, he had taken up smoking as an act of rebellion against his parents when he was 17. Since then, it had been his closest companion; always there in good times and bad.

As tears streamed down his face, his hands felt for the pack in the pocket of his hospital gown; a small perk his nurse had allowed on his last day with her. Opening it, he pulled out a single cigarette, his hands shaking as he lit it.

He savored the taste and aroma as he breathed it in. And with every exhale, he offered a silent prayer—for himself, for his loved ones, and for anyone else caught in this hellish situation.

The man finished his cigarette and placed it proudly in the ashtray, resolute in the knowledge that he had done his best to find some moments of peace in spite of it all. As the clock ticked closer to his final twenty minutes, he found solace in this one, simple pleasure.
