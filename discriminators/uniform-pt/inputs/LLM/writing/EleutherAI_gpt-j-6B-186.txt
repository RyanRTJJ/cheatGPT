 
The phrase doesn't have to be a story. 
"It's not so bad here" is the title of a song from the album "It's Not So Bad Now" by the band It's a Beautiful Day. I haven't been able to find out what the song was called before that, but apparently it wasn't so bad then either.

It is not so bad
The phrase comes from a line played during a scene in a movie/TV show called It's not so bad, now, is it? (1973-2003) in which Bill Cosby gives a talk on dating. He has a few more quotes in this talk on things that are not so bad:

There's no reason to get divorced!
It's not so bad anymore
I wish you luck anyway, because I love you
I'm sorry it happened, and I'm going to see you

It's not so bad here? is a song by English hard rock guitarist Robert Johnson (Robert Joseph Johnson III). 
(I don't know how they found this song.)
The chorus says:

It's not so bad here
  It's a long way from nowhere
  I could be worse off
  I still have my hands

From Wikipedia: 

A reworking of the song "Long Way from Home", a song also known as "I'm Sorry I Was a Bad Boy (But So I'm a Good Girl Now)". It is believed that this version of the song was first recorded in August, 1965 but never released until the 1983 album, One Man Blues.

The title of the album, it's not so bad here, comes from this song.

What's not so bad is a line from the musical comedy Bye Bye Birdie (1963), the title of which is a pun on the "It's not so bad now" expression. (The show is set during the 1950s in New York City, when the expression was rarely heard, as it was considered dated and was often used as an insult.)
