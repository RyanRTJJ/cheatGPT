I will never forget that night. When the sky had cleared, revealing a beautiful blanket of stars, I knew my plan had worked. I had spent weeks researching, digging for the perfect place for us to appreciate the view of the night sky. Finally, I found the area. All the way on the edge of town, where almost no one ever went, it was an isolated area. Little was known about it.

It was a perfect location for us, as we wanted to be alone without any distractions. As the sky grew darker and the stars began to twinkle and shine, I saw the look of wonder in her eyes. Together we set up our viewing spot. I had stars of every size and color. We then made a picnic blanket out of all the stars and stretched it out, creating a starry sky.

She was mesmerized by all the stars. She was in awe of creation. We talked all night, until the sun started to rise and our magical night together had come to an end.

Now, each time we look up at the night sky together, I think back to that magical night, where we created our own starry sky and I say, "Do you remember the starry sky we created that night?" 

She will always nod, with a little smile on her lips, and say "Yes, I remember it like it was yesterday."
