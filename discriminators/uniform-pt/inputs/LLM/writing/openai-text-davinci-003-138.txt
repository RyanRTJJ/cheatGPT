The night was dark and chilly. The wind whistled its way through the empty streets of the small town. Even in the darkness, it was difficult not to get lost.

Suddenly, lightning flashed, followed by thunder that vibrated off the ground. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a figure in the shadows. It was a man, dressed in black and wearing a hood. He looked as if he was searching for something.

But who? Or what? It seemed almost premeditated, like he'd made a plan of attack.

Suddenly, he stepped out of the shadows and began to approach her. Fear surged through her body and she turned on her heels to run. But she knew she had to face him â€“ she couldn't just run away.

She took a deep breath and turned to face him. He was taller than her and seemed to have the advantage. But something in his eyes told her he was not here to harm her. He nodded, as if to acknowledge her courage.

"What is it you want?" she asked in a shaky voice.

The man spoke in a deep, strong voice. "I am looking for a woman, a woman with courage. Are you her?"

Without hesitation, she answered, "Yes, I am."

The man's eyes lit up with approval. "You have been chosen. You must come with me if you are to fulfill your destiny."

And from that moment on, destiny became her reality.
