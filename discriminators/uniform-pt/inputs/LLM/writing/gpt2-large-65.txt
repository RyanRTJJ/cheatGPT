* This story was inspired by: "I've been thinking about Christmas all my life, you should too."

* I was a child, and my mother, bless her, never said, "Merry Christmas." No, thank you, I don't remember it. In fact, there was another story, about how the mother would not want to give Christmas to Christmas children in her house because they were naughty, naughty, naughty children. And it seems that I was one of those naughty children (as I think I was!). Perhaps I am not, but perhaps I am. I'll leave that one alone.

To all the people who love being silly and for the people who don't, Christmas is coming. I guess I'm stuck. There's not enough time. But I am thankful.

* I have been told that some have asked about this story. And it's easy.

I started writing this in 2007/2008. I am not a journalist by trade. I am no stranger to social media or to the Internet. But having a story to tell that I have already gotten a lot of use out of is an amazing thing. And for those, who have asked, I am going to write this piece of crap down as my only Christmas wish. I am not kidding. I have been told several times by people that they were pleased to have me tell their childhood-dream-come-true story. And it has been a blast, because I can tell stories.
