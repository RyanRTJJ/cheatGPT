"The first time you saw him you were struck dumb. The picture he had taken was a photo taken of himself as he was at the time????. It shows a happy guy. He was doing what he loved to do but he had no idea what time he was going to meet his destiny. In the face of the picture is the cold hard face of Death."
"The photograph on the dart board is a life size portrait of Steve that????? sits in Death's house. It stares back at the picture with cold hard eyes of anger and revenge. Steve..... you have to accept your fate.
This is a very long and rambling poem. I would like to see how it plays out. I have always imagined Steve as a man with a death wish. He has an overwhelming urge to be killed but doesn't know why. As he looks at the portrait on the dart board, it starts to eat into his brain. Death sees his desperation????. He has no idea that Death is the one looking out the window. It will become even more clear when you read on for more.
Steve.... have you ever wondered why you can't stand life in general. As you look at that photo pinned to the dart board of Death, you suddenly get frightened?????. You can't take it anymore. But Death... the picture looks so happy???? you want to laugh. As Death comes closer, Steve gets nervous?????. Death's skeleton face smiles back at you. You?????. It has a strange and sinister feeling to it. Death....????.
Is it just for fun????? or is this a warning for Steve himself? How does Steve come to know all of this is he himself in the picture? Your imagination is the final answer.
