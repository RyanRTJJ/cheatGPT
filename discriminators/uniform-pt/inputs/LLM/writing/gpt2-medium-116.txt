I got the following warning: this game is not for all use. You may see a warning that says "Warning: this game is not suitable for children". It's probably not. Go try another game.

Note: This is a prompt that's meant on our private forums and only there. You should not post it to the main forum for general discussion. If you like it on the main forum, please click on the link directly to the "Tell us about your project?" question on the top right. The page you will see will ask you to go and leave a message and write a story based on it. If you don't see the warning on the top right, that means you did not click on the link to enter the prompt, but you forgot to enter the word "tell" and forget to write a message. In that case you'll get a "suggestion from the community" message saying:

This prompt was suggested by you. It is not approved, created, nor endorsed by Nintendo of America Inc. Please use your discretion when posting your projects or messages. Thank you

That's great, and we appreciate the suggestion! The first five questions follow this format:

Why do you want to do this?

Why are you building this object?

Do you have any other projects you'd like to create?

And any or all of these...

What do you think should be done next?

Is your story or project a good one to tell?

Please don't make your answer any longer than one question
