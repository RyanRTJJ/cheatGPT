___________ The ocean season would be a very different season to other seasons, since it contains all the oceans and therefore every waterway on Earth. From your own experience, who would you want to narrate your story in this new season?

Planet C-01 in the star system A-13 and Planet C-02 in the star system A-12, the fourth planet to respond, and the first planet in their system to respond. This planet has four moons and each moon contains the full message.

Planet N-18 in the A-16 star system answers, as does Planet O-33 in system O-3, and Planet G-20 in system G-25

Planet D-10 and Planet E-02 in system D-
