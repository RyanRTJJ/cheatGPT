 He is, obviously, the only one present.  So why should they need to explain this?  Why aren't they talking about this?  Then why am I bothering to ask them if I know them and they would say what they need to say?  The last question was: Why is our government still looking at UFOs while they're investigating UFOs?  Well that raises many questions. Was there any UFO in the past or present that made it into my inbox?  Was there any UFO in the past that I could never see because the atmosphere was colder and I was the only one in there?  The only explanation seems to be that these things are not there now anymore (it wasn't until the next year or so!).
Is there any kind of special power that's been given to aliens by extraterrestrials like them? Did your parents ever mention it?  No, maybe not.  But I think I'd say that this is the story of some interesting times.  So many amazing stories that we now know very little about.  Some are about a mystery that occurred long before the scientific community, or were known to us before.  But some of them will be even better if the stories are told here.  So, all right.  Have a good day.  So thank you to all involved! We miss you, Dr. L.A. O'Laughlin, for your kind contribution to this amazing science.  I'm honored to have the honor to serve on the board of a wonderful public service.  And thanks to those who have had great help and who have made more of a difference.
