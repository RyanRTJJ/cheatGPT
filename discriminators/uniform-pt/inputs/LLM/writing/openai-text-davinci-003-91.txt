Once upon a time, there lived a man who was forever plagued with an agonizing sense of guilt. He thought he was always the cause of his own death, no matter the circumstance. He reasoned that whatever situation he found himself in, he had either contributed to it in the past or was responsible for the current state.

He desperately wanted to make an escape from the constant turmoil in his head, but he couldn't seem to find a way out. He felt pangs of deep sorrow each time he traveled down the familiar path of self-deprecation. 

One night, realizing he could no longer handle the pain, he decided to end his life. As he frantically searched for pills or a rope to hang himself from, he realized that he had probably created this very situation by his own destructive behavior. As he prepared to take his last breath, he mumbled to himself, "I am forever the cause of my own death."

The man closed his eyes, and with one final sigh, he let go of the guilt and all the pain he was carrying. This was his last moment, and he chose to accept that he was responsible for it. Little did he know that his acceptance of culpability was actually his saving grace.

Although he had taken his own life, his newfound peace had freed him from the suffocating guilt that had been haunting him. His legacy would be one of responsibility and freedom, and he would forever be remembered as one who accepted himself and the consequences of his actions.
