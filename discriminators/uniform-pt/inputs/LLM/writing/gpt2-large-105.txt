 That's bad, right?  Well it is, and it requires a hero to save the planet and its life and, most importantly, its ecosystem.  I'm using the first of them here, my two-legged friend, to save the biosphere.
What did you think of this story?  Have any other examples of similar prompt writers?  Please share them in the comment section below.  Also, don't forget to subscribe to  Adventures in SciFi Publishing  on  Feedly.  I'm a huge fan of being able to share stuff on the platform! Thank you for reading!
[1] If you don't like the idea of people talking to animals with their mouths and their vocal cords, just read the story and tell me you're not a total asshole. Then you can go and cry about it.  (I can't even pretend that I have the faintest knowledge of this. Please do not insult the intelligence of these individuals.) And, just in case anyone thinks that I like or understand your own people (you people, as your people say, are so rude and nasty), I'll also like or understand one or two of your ideas. Just don't tell me they're my ideas and it would make some difference to the actual story. (I've never been to the tropics, but I'll take the challenge.) If you don't want an author to come at you with words on your head, don't say stuff about what an animal is. That is rude. If you want to use dogs for this exercise, then you're an idiot. And there's no place on the planet to go, or you're an idiot. There is no place on the planet to kill a dog, but that's because there is NO planet where you CAN kill dogs -- I'm sorry, that was a mistake.
