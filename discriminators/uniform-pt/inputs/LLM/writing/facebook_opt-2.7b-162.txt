 Edit: or if you want to be more literary, write a song that matches seven of it's original songs and then choose what those songs mean.
Love the idea of songs. I can't write lyrics, but maybe I can compose and write them in something like Dvorak. Thanks.
If you're serious about this idea, then you might have a shot at writing a song. I write some songs for piano, I know how hard it can be! My recommendation is definitely to start composing and write the lyrics after you have a basic melody or arrangement in place; otherwise you can get overwhelmed with all of the writing. Best of luck.
Thanks a lot. I'll give it a try. Can't even remember the last time I have tried to write a song. I think I should have had the courage a little more than now. Well, I still have a lot of free time left over with the summer coming up. I guess I'll be more motivated then. I'd really like to write a better song that is still within the seven deadly sins genre. Maybe I should put the idea down on paper for inspiration and then translate it into music.
Best of luck! This sounds really interesting.
I posted a link to my site at /r/WritingPrompts. I have tried writing a poem before and it was actually pretty fun. I have heard songs and I am sure I can come up with some ideas. Hopefully. Thanks again for the inspiration. I'll keep you posted if I manage to finish anything.
That's definitely a good place. People there will most likely be very supportive. I'm also curious as to what you write about. I don't think there's a limit to what you can write about. This is my second biggest post I think. It's kind of like when you make a post and it becomes popular and you're then curious to see what people are writing and why they're making it.
