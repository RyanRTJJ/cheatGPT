  Write from the perspective of your younger self: how would you deal with this situation?  Do you want to live or be destroyed inside?
My younger self would take it well. He would make sure they didn't know what went wrong, and would probably make time travel a bit more popular. And I could just be a normal 18 year old teenager...
I guess. But think of the opportunities. Would you be able to go to the past and create a whole new life for yourself, learning all the things you would never have otherwise known? Knowing that in a year you could go back and help make your parents happy again?
Yeah I know what I'd do. If it was a happy 18 year old me, I'd probably go to the future, go to high school with them, and then go through high school with them, and so on, until college. Then I would make sure everything was perfect in the future, so I could be happy with my parents again.
So after that, you're done. Forever.
Unless I'm wrong, then I can have a happy ending with a future parent, and just like that. I change the future, and live a fulfilling life. If I knew it was all going to be perfect, I would just stay in that timeline and forget who I am. I'd probably have to live there for forever, until there was a way for me to leave.
Hmmâ€¦I don't know...it's an interesting point. But since it's a random 18. What about a high school senior you get to meet and be friends with?  Even then, I don't know how you could ever get over the feeling of being completely alone.  What if you never had a family and you couldn't help anyone else but yourself?
If the future wasn't perfect though, I couldn't live with the guilt of having ruined their perfect life. So I wouldn't, and if I had children
