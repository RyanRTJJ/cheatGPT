 
Methos told you, "You will be my heir." I was the daughter of a nobleman,  
and now I will be the heir of this house. When the moon is full, when the clouds are high,  
you will see her. Don't go. When the moon is full, when the clouds are high,  
when the moon is full, when the clouds are high.

You will get the answer to this story on the following pages.

(You don't have to make a connection between the two questions on the same page. In your story, you only have to answer A or B, not both.)

A. Where do they get the foodstuffs used to make all those foods in the refrigerator and pantry and storage room?

B. When did you find this out?

A. You know, I'm pretty sure people ate this stuff at a party. Or on vacation or something. It made me kinda sick. It seems really gross.

B. Oh, I'm talking about the frozen pizzas. The frozen pizza is kind of weird because it has corn and nuts in it, and it makes it look really nice and pretty. It's really nice, but it's kind of weird.

A. I think I'm a little worried because my mother keeps mentioning things like that to me all the time.

B. Don't worry, you'll be fine. Just have a good time.

A. My mother says it to me all the time. My mother says, "I think it would be better if we didn't fight."  
She said, "Well, I want you to be a wonderful queen. I want you to be a good queen and help your brother and all of the people in the kingdom out. And I think that just you need to be a little more kind."  
But my mother says she wants me to be a good mother and a good sister and a good wife. And you know what that does to me. Everybody else says that is the way to go.
