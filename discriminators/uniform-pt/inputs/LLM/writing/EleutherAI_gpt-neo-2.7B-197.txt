For the past two days you've walked along the beach with your eyes wide, mouth open, hands on your knees to keep from falling. What was going on in your mind as you stumbled a lot? What was going through your mind as you sat hunched over in your favorite chair for hours on end, your hands folded in front of you, the sun beating down on your head, only you were too big to be seen or heard?

The world is not your enemy. I made a choice to become your problem, and you are the one with your problem. You are, too, because you created this mess by believing you were too big to fail. When you look at nature, the universe, the way it works
