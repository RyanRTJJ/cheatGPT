 what is reality?
This is going to be an interesting one!  A very difficult topic for me to understand. When someone asked me about the question, I suggested that what the physics can tell us is that it's possible that the universe is in two places from the same point of view. You can do that from a parallel universe. So, for example, the story could go like this: One of the worlds has a parallel universe with a very intelligent machine. There is a parallel universe without a machine, but a human being is placed in one of the parallel worlds. Now, if you look at one of the worlds very closely, some of the worlds features are different from those of the other two.  However, this is not a parallel world with a machine. This is a parallel universe with an intelligent human being - a scientist that has to be very intelligent to do her research on that particular parallel universe. So, it's possible that someone that lives in that parallel universe is actually from that universe. But if you look at people that live in that parallel universe, you'll notice that some people are very similar to you. And some people are very different. In other words, they're not like your typical character in another universe.  In these two parallel universes, everyone has this common characteristic that we have in our universes. Their characteristics would seem to be so similar that our common feature would seem to be similar to theirs too.  So, this makes sense.  But they're not. They're different. Why not? If they're different, you're going to be able to describe them differently. The problem, once again, is that we don't do that.  We assume that these two parallel universes exist as a kind of mirror universe.  And there are some things we can say about the parallel universes.  Things that we can talk about as if they were different realities. And our question is, what's the relationship between these two parallel universes?  We're trying to get in a field where we can explain as much
