The little girl moved into the small neighborhood a few months prior and while most of the neighbors kept to their own business, the one who lived across the street from her always had a warm smile each time she saw him. 

Her name was Meghan and she was only 8 years old. She noticed that this neighbor, an elderly man named William, didn’t talk or make much noise at all. She never asked about it and assumed it was perhaps because he liked peace and quiet, much as she did. 

One day, however, she noticed a look in William’s eyes that she hadn’t seen before. It was like he was trying to communicate with her, but he couldn’t find the words. She soon learned that he had taken a vow of silence many years ago, back when his beloved wife passed away. 

Meghan felt inspired to help William end the vow he had held for so long. She got together a group of her friends who, together with their parents, lovingly supported William’s journey to healing. With their help, they were able to slowly help him break his silence. 

William shared stories with the group about how he and his wife lived in the neighborhood for over 40 years, how they found joy in small details of life and how he still felt her presence and love around him each day. As he opened up, people saw the old joy and vitality return to his eyes and tune his voice. 

It was a long and difficult road for William, but in the end, he found his voice again, thanks to Meghan and her friends. People from all over the neighborhood came to congratulate him and it felt like a true celebration of his triumph
