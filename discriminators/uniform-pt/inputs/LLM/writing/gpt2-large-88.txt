........................................................................... Flight MH370 is "in trouble" in Beijing. It will soon turn an empty piece of land into another destination. Can the passengers prove they have flown for a full year?................................................................... The truth about flight MH370 (and why it is so important) was finally revealed.

The MH370 mystery is finally solved, and the search in remote parts of the Indian Ocean can now resume from where the search previously ended.

Including this search, the Australian and Chinese navies have conducted more than 50 search missions that covered more than 100,000 square kilometres. Search and rescue work continues there.

The news was announced to the Indian media this morning, at a time when there was no news of a breakthrough or sign of good news on the ground.

The search is still underway in the southern Indian Ocean, which is the only place where debris discovered since March has survived the journey for more than a decade. The largest part of the aircraft was found on a remote section of a reef off the coast of Fremantle.

The aircraft vanished in March 2014, three months after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It is believed a routine maintenance check on the airframe's engine was delayed by a maintenance problem that prevented one of the two pilots from getting a proper reading on pressure before the plane took off.

The Boeing 777-200ER plane, known as 777, which took off from Kuala Lumpur in March 8, 2014, did not transmit any signals for nearly 3,700km in the last 2 hours of its flight, leaving many to believe that the jetliner ran out of fuel while attempting to land at Beijing.

There have been rumours since, that information from the "black boxes" may have been erased but these are now believed to be inaccurate.

Flight MH370 disappeared into the clouds at a point known as the "ping" from which the last transmission was made, less than 16 hours into the flight.

This latest development comes as a relief to many who are hopeful the black boxes will reveal the full story
