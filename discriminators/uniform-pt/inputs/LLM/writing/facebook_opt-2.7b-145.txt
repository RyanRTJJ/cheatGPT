 Describe the characters, actions, thoughts, opinions, fears.
Or better yet: [ IP ] The Death Guard  Describe all the things death hates, the various rituals Death holds. What are the dangers Death runs into and does that mean they must die to protect the ones Death really cares about, if Death even gets involved.
That's great too. But just the title could be "IP: The Death Guard". I always have a weird moment with names.  Also, I want to see this. I love those stories where a character is a death, but has something wrong with them.
The Death Guard is a cool name, I may want to borrow that for my personal backstory. "The Death Guard" is going to have to get a little bigger, however. I'd like it to have a little more of a back story.  I'd be interested in any feedback you might come across.
You can PM me a copy of your completed story or post it here. My story was pretty short. I just want to help you out.
Sorry, I got busy last night and it's almost 8:00am here. If you want to PM it to me tomorrow then that's fine. :)
Of course. Just write it now, I'll write it back. You may need to sleep later though. Work tomorrow. :) I'm in CST.
I will take you up on your offer, my friend. Thanks. :)
I'm awake now. Write your story. PM me it if you want, it'll be great to read when you finish. :D
Alright, I edited my post, and PM'd you the story. If you still insist on offering critique then I'm open to suggestions.
Yes. Send me a link to the post you wrote here. I'll take a look.
