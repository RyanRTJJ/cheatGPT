  Or "I wish you were blind" she said. "I wish you were deaf" she said.
Both works of fiction...
You said you didn't want that. That's the whole premise of the prompt. I already told you I didn't want to give you *an option.*
Oh, sorry. Must have misunderstood. I thought you were suggesting that to get it out of their head they write something in which they really wish death was an option, only to end up writing about someone else dying. Like, a real life story. I guess that would work.   Not sure I would tell someone to just "write something for themselves" even if they think the story I gave them doesn't meet their standards. Maybe we can compromise? Writing something they could never publish?
If it's a real people's experience, I'd have more of a problem with it if they were just playing with someone's death for their own ends. That's a more clear misuse of the experience.   I really think your suggestion is the most constructive thing we can do right now. Thank you.
My boyfriend's mother has dementia and I'm glad there's a subreddit for these kinds of stories. I've taken to writing long winded, detailed emails with her about her past. I don't want to have to tell this to her in person. This helps. It makes me feel connected even if she thinks I'm crazy.
> My boyfriend's mother has dementia and I'm glad there's a subreddit for these kinds of stories.  I'm sure she appreciates all the validation you've given her ;)
Well she doesn't have it anymore. Thank god. But yeah I get what you mean about needing a sub-reddit. I hope to be in a good position to make that happen soon, one day.
> Well she doesn't have it anymore.   That's what you said last summer.
Yeah man I totally did, now I'm at the point where I won't even tell that to her. I don't think she's capable of it either
