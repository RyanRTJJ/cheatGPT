It was the ultimate responsibility no one wanted to take on. As the last human on earth, I was tasked with conducting the funeral of the human race. I was overwhelmed with grief and sorrow. I didn't know what to say, how to say it, or who to say it to. There was no one here to provide comfort, only silence. 

I slowly walked the streets of a desolate city. My feet shuffled to a sad beat of their own as I passed abandoned buildings and graves of my once prosperous species. I had left behind my home, my family, my friends, and my futureâ€”all gone as if they never existed. 

I eventually reached the central plaza of the city, a fitting place for the ceremony. I looked around one last time, knowing that this would be the last time I would stand in the presence of my people. I said a silent goodbye to the ones I loved who were no longer with me, and to the dream of what could have been. 

Shaking off the tears, I gathered my strength and kneeled down to the ground. I spoke out loud, as if it were my last prayer, offering a benediction to the human race. I thanked our ancestors for their courage and hard work, and wished my species luck in the afterlife. 

Finally, with heavy hearts, we all lowered our heads. We silently mourned the loss of our species, and said goodbye to our planet. All was quiet until one final ray of sunlight illuminated the sky, a sign of new hope amongst despair. 

And with that, we said our final farewell to humanity.
