I stood outside the school gates watching the kids come streaming in from the bus drop off. As I watched, one by one my ability kicked in and I registered them on a 'danger scale' of 1 to 10. Most were a dull 1 or 2, the same as any other teenage kid in the world, but a few registered slightly higher.

Suddenly, the unassuming new kid caught my eye. He was short and slight and carried a satchel across his chest. He seemed totally harmless and I was sure he would register low on my scale.

But as he walked closer, my ability suddenly kicked in and i realized that the new kid was actually a 10. He radiated danger like nobody I had ever seen before and I quickly looked away and prayed that he couldn't sense my fear.

As he disappeared into the throng of students, my stomach churned and I wondered what peril could be lurking within his disguise. I knew one thing for sure, this wasn't good and I vowed to stay as far away from him as possible.
