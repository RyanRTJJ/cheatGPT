 (It's a prompt for an upcoming writing prompt challenge.)
What? Is there anything on here that isn't *kinda* like this...?!
Not that I've ever known of. If you're having trouble with any part, feel free to ask.
Okay, I didn't know if it was something already done in a lot of ways or not. Thanks :)
Most of the stuff here has the prompt added to it to make a specific story, as opposed to just writing about the setting/world/people of a given prompt.   Just write a story.
I know I know, but I've just seen too many prompts take ideas that are more or less the same...and not a good idea.  >Just write a story.  I will, but it looks like I have a lot of work to do to make sure I get them to the point where they're still good.  >Write a story based on this prompt: Earth has gained a fifth season. The season of the ocean.  What is this, a writing prompt?

There are limits, but they're being pushed. What will we do when we get back? (And, more importantly, how do we survive, as a species, for longer and for better?)
I have a story in mind, I just needed inspiration for the plot.  Do you happen to know how long that prompt is for?  I'll have to write it at least for the weekend...no time to do it after that.

We don't have a set number. That's completely up to us. It's not
