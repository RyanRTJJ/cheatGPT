Michael had been searching for the perfect avocado all morning. He woke up with a craving for guacamole. He figured that it was a good opportunity to take a walk, so he pulled his jacket on and made his way to the grocery store, determined to find a beautiful, ripe avocado to make into his favorite dip. 

As he approached the produce section, he quickly realized that getting a perfect avocado was not as easy as he'd hoped. So many avocados were either too hard, or too soft. He was about to give up, when something caught his eye. 

At the bottom of the pile was one avocado that was just the right consistency - not too hard, not too soft. He smiled as he picked it up. It was the perfect avocado that he had been searching for all morning. 

He knew this avocado was special, so Michael he took it home and washed it carefully. Then he whisks up a batch of guacamole, using the perfectly ripe avocado as the main ingredient. 

To his delight, Michael savored the amazing flavor of the guacamole, made from his perfect avocado. He savored every bite, knowing that it was a miracle he found the perfect avocado and was now able to enjoy the delicious taste.
