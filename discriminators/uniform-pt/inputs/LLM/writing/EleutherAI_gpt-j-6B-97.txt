When you die, you don't go to the afterlife of you're
  religion, you go to the afterlife of the religion whose tenets you
  followed most closely, knowingly or not.

A:

If I'm not allowed, 

You will face the judgement of God.  God's judgement is harsh and unforgiving to most of us who don't live in accordance to His word but He will overlook your trespasses against him. In a sense, you can look forward to spending eternity in God's presence.  Some might call it a judgement, others might call it mercy.
You will face the judgement of your ancestors.  Just like our ancestors were judged in the garden of Eden, those who were disobedient will face judgement (the sin of their fathers).  They will see their actions of disobedience and how it hurt their families and their offspring.
You will face the judgement of our Creator.  Our Creator is a demanding God and because of that, if you were not a believer of Christ, He will give you a second chance.  Because you were created by God and have been redeemed, you will be able to know Him more fully if you open your eyes to see His truth through His word, not to simply hear His word.

There are multiple types of afterlife in fiction, often as an example of the afterlife being other types of reality than this one.
Some types of afterlife are more like being inside a computer, others have some form of magic such as teleportation.
In this sense, the afterlife could be that your soul moves into the afterlife of your religion... or your spirit does, and your soul can be wherever it wishes in this life.
