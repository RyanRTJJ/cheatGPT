 A man is accused of crimes after he releases a series of novel by a prominent detective, and then becomes a fugitive.  The series is written by a popular writer, who is jailed in his home country on charges of sexual assault and corruption (which would be a good place for the story).  Then the victim is finally exonerated. No one lives like a criminal after he releases a series of books by the same popular writer.  A criminal is given a fair trial, and then the book is out to read.  The crime writer is free to write another series of books after the first one has been released.  A few stories are written as part of the series, but they only have a limited number of people involved, and never have anything for sale.  By now, we all know that's wrong.  The problem is we have no idea how the series has gone wrong, and how many of its characters remain criminals.  We don't know if the series is real, or if it's created to be made-up or just an echo chamber of the original series to get people who've been in the game (that are still in the game) to buy the series as they see fit. How do we deal with these writers writing books in real life?  Writing novels based on a series' pre-existing and never-before-published characters is the most dangerous mistake ever made. Here's how to do it: First, if you want to write an actual crime novel, you need to write it in a real world context.  In Real Life, we think that's how it feels when a story is being published.  So let's write a fictional world in which our heroes meet two real-life friends, and you have to talk to them about why you want to write a series based on your own personal experience.  Once out there, you have to get a handle on the context in which you want the protagonist of the crime novel
