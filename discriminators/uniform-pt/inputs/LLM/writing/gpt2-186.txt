Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly described Jodi Chatterley's job as an associate professor of history at West Virginia University. A previous version said she had been an assistant professor of English and the assistant professor of history at Vanderbilt University. This has been fixed.

The Associated Press is conducting a public-records request with the Associated Press for a news report that describes a story on the story of a female who says she was sexually assaulted at a West Virginia University fraternity party two years ago in which she says she was raped by a male. The story is accurate as of publication of this story.


A version of this story originally misidentified her gender to its original report.

Liz B. Lee is the editor in chief of the AP.

The AP did not return a request for comment Friday after news of Chatterley's story spread.

The story was written Aug. 2, 2009, by a male senior named David LaRue. The story ran on AP The Wall Street Journal, a daily covering the University of Tennessee.

The Washington Post reported that LaRue had described the attack to his accuser, saying he felt uncomfortable standing to talk about it because the perpetrator "looked scared."

Chatterley's story was not reported in all the news media and news programs on Tennessee. In fact, it was not picked up in the news media since it was not featured in many other media outlets that reported on the story.

Tennessee State Rep. Steve Hefner acknowledged after speaking to the Times Sentinel that Chatterley had denied the allegations in 2012 and said the allegation against her was "fraught with lies" because "some of the story I told was taken out of context."

The University of Tennessee said LaRue "did not agree with or deny the allegations against her."

The Post also said the story was part of a much longer, long history of harassment allegations against the University. Last Saturday, University President Robert Hales spoke with The Associated Press about Chatterley's story.
