--------------- #### END OF FORBIDDEN QUESTION ---> A061 ------ My question is... what is the reason that the continent of Theis called Theis... and why? It is known that there is a great magic here, and people have made a pact in order to protect it and the power source from the demonic spirits living in the mountain. As such, it is not in my books as the continent of Theis. Theis then is really one of several names for what is known as New Theis, after which, there is an entirely distinct continent. When the land there was born out of the dying world of the gods, Theis had a new beginning when the last remnants of the old world, who had created New Theis, were sealed away, and the power source within became the land here. In all, Theis is comprised of a multitude of new nations, in order to protect the magic. They have also gone so far as to name their new land upon its birth, the Land of the Metal - in their own tradition, for the last of the gods to live here, after their deaths, and for to live the legacy of their power within the land - which still exists to this day. There was once a war here - a war where the gods fought but the land was saved - but was this war all in vain? I wonder, I was born on the land of New Theis - not only was it mine, but so was the land that would be reborn. Who really exists to this day? --- AUGUST 22, 2245 ---> A066 ------ I was born under a certain name. My name is: Rokugan. I am born on Theis. --- SUGETIME: 1/22/2245 ----
