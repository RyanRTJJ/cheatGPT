 Show a picture of the object, such as a flower, or a person, such as a woman, and explain why she's important — in essence, what the object represents.  In fact, you should be able to describe each of the five objects individually — but remember that you'll be asked to choose which of them would be interesting to the reader.  If you fail to choose what your object is, just write, "I want to go to the grocery store."
