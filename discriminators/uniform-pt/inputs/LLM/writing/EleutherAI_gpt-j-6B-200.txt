 

The other day I went for an appointment at the dentist and I was surprised to meet two old men who said hello at the door. My dentist is a really cool guy and I really love his office, but on the downside our office is near a church and they do these really loud services at the wrong time of day, and on some days the music is just too loud to work in. And if I'm in there before and after services, it feels like I'm in church.

So anyway, this past Wednesday was one of those days. I get my new tooth filled and it takes awhile for my tooth to kill the bacterial colony inside it, so I'm in the chair for a good 30 minutes. When I get up to leave I find two old men sitting in waiting rooms and when I start to open the door they look up and say "Hi".

Both of them are white haired old guys with very different body types and both look like they could have been in their thirties or forties. One is short with a massive gut and the other is a very tall guy with very skinny legs. Both are dressed in pressed oxfords and slacks, one wearing his tie undone.

You can't really tell that they're old, that they're in their sixties. It's hard to tell for sure until they get up, then they tell their age and I realize that they're in their sixties. I guess they came to my dentist in their forties and now they're just coming for a check up.

I ask if they enjoy coming to my dentist because I like going to a new place and not having my old dentist see me, and they both say it's the best and that I do a great job. I think to myself "Well, I'd like to think so", but I think to them "No way!".

So I ask them if they like going to church
