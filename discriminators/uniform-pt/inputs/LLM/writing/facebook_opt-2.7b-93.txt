 Just like that.  Now go!
Well you see, the Klan member never really woke up...
So, you are going to have it so that they just stay with the same dream. Which will be fun for you :)
Or I could just kill myself...
This is what you should do lol, it is actually quite fun :P Also, you may want to do something on where they are all at now, if they ever wake up. But if you have not created enough, just come back on it later.  Edit: Spelling
I don't know, they're in pretty bad situations right now :/  So I've decided I'll keep them all in their same situation so I can just fuck around with them XD  I mean, when I did a dream where I woke up inside my friend's house, all I ever did was stay in there and play video games and talk shit to her about whatever. It ended up being a pretty fun experience
Well just go with it if you want to, it could be great! I do not have any ideas of what you could write, but i do believe that you have a great grasp on your writing. If you come back and still want the prompt or are interested, just message me! :)
I will definetly come back later! Just because I don't feel like I could complete my idea.  Any suggestions of what kind of story to write?   Thanks again for your help, by the way, it really helps!
Okay! Well in this world there would be an uprising, and the leader will be the president. It turns out he is just an old evil man who got reelected.  But as the years go by and it gets harder and harder, the country breaks up, and the government is no longer able to protect everyone. The KKK will be called into action to restore a certain way of life and
