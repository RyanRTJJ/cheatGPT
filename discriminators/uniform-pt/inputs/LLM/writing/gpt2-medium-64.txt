Â It didn't help that President Truman took out the first atomic weapon at Los Alamos over an hour after his inauguration. Then after his death an effort was made to convince the new government to use the bomb within 60 days. The attempt was quashed, because it could be seen to interfere with the development of a weapon of mass destruction. The Soviets would build a weapon, which their nuclear experts believed to be a nuclear weapon. But because they were building such a weapon and were not being tested for use, there was a "black out" of almost all weapons technology. This kept most countries under the radar, and they were so closely allied to the West it was almost impossible for them to get the bomb. The United Kingdom still had a nuclear arsenal, but that was not used until after the war as a means to keep France and America under control, and to stop Europe from becoming one of the world powers. The U.S. did not actually test the bomb until it wasn't used, and while American forces were there, they worked diligently on developing a deterrent strategy against it. One theory holds it was to avoid some sort of nuclear war during the Korean War that may have cost thousands of lives. But there had to be some other reason for it. It could have had a large impact on U.S. politics. Since the war ended on July 20 of 1945, the Soviet Union has made efforts to develop several new weapons. One is a device that uses tiny nuclear particles called teslas to trigger nuclear reactions. This device causes a thermonuclear reaction that destroys the nucleus or atom of the bomb you are trying to create. This device is the precursor to the atomic bomb, and the Soviets are confident they could produce a
