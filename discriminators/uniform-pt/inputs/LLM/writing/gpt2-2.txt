____________ I am reading an article which gives the final version of an article from November 3, 1996. A note about the "informal" form of the information. I made this a couple of months ago (the one you got from a post on the topic of the "informal" form of news reporting for the newspapers): ____________ The first of what I read is the story of Mr. Thomas Danklack, "The "Inventor of the Storytelling" (published by the Southern Methodist University Press in 1954). A special edition of that issue is available for $10. The reader can print this article for $500 for the price of a digital edition - but I've been searching extensively, reading over two hundred and fifty articles before finding the paper. Perhaps the paper is worth even more to readers. Here is a paragraph from the article: It can sometimes be helpful to talk to editors of the newspapers, but I have not seen one so long as they have tried to get their hands on a copy. The idea that the idea that the paper ought to become an indispensable publication can be helpful to the readers, but there is a need, as in the case of the first six issues of the "informal," to explain to editors and readers precisely what is going on. A paper which should be accessible through the press and its distributors could be more difficult to find, especially for those who come to the United States to read news about the world that is not in print. The author of this article was a journalist and a publicist for The Texas Monthly and for the Houston Chronicle, for which he had been editor-in-chief until the late 1980s. Mr. Danklack's article was written in June 1979, and was published five times in the Dallas Morning News, which was bought by the paper in 1985. The newspaper was made to appear to be "a rag-tag group of reporters," Mr. Danklack's work stated.
