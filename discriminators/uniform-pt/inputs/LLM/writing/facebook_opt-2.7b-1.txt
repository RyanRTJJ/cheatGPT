 Do you think he killed himself, or tried to go out killing? What would you have done had you been in his position that day?
This is interesting.  If I'm in a situation of imminent death, and my only chance is to kill the people who made me feel unhappy and worthless. I'd be inclined to shoot everyone I could. But since its only me and him, I would have to choose.
I wonder what would cause someone to become suicidal in the first place, or if they are like this from the get go? Is it just a sad thing that will always be lurking in the back of your mind? I have no idea. I just have to think, what would my parents do, what would friends do? Or how about you, OP's question is very relavant.
I think its just a sad thing that has been lurking in the back of their minds forever. A lot of guys I knew growing up were very depressed. It isn't something that's likely to get better with age. Like all diseases, it isn't something that is going to become irrelevant with age. If your parents are abusive, you're more likely to develop a mental illness. Some people don't have that. There are just some people that are more susceptible to it.
Thank you. It's a lot harder to deal with on the other side, I suppose it's not surprising that more people do that. I don't like to think about where my life may be headed, in that respect. I hope you didn't read that as me being critical, not all mental illnesses are the same.
No no I didn't take it as critical. I have depression and suicidal tendencies. My therapist tried to point out that its been the last few years since I've been happy, and I'm lucky enough to be able to tell people that about
