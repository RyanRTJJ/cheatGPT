The next is a prompt from my Patreon's  Art and Lore page. 
I asked on there if anyone would like to see the results of my story, and many, many people responded in the affirmative.
And while the story didn't end up doing well, there are definitely some more plot hooks out there in these stories. I'd love to see what you all think. 
As for now, this is my last story for now until the new season (in about two weeks). If you have any comments, feel free to email me at vincent@kaleidostrategies.com. I would love to hear from you and we can continue to post story ideas together.
Thanks for reading my work, and see you next time!
