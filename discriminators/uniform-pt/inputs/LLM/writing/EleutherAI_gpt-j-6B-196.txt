They are lying to each other, but in different ways. Who would you say you would be better off if your life was over, if it wasn't going to change anything? 

A:

I think I'd probably say, 

 I wish I was as beautiful

For the best part, my life is meaningless but not because 

 the other person doesn't find me beautiful but because I'm not beautiful enough

The person I'd be better off having never known:

 I could be as beautiful, she would still be there, and her opinion of me would be better.  She wouldn't think I was ugly any more.  I'd like that, I'd have the chance to know myself, and maybe be able to improve my looks in the future.

I feel that I'm missing out by being alive, as I know how I'd feel if I were dead.  

 Even when I was alive, I was never happy all the time.  I felt miserable at times, but I always thought of the future--I'd be able to get over it.  I'm not actually going to get over it, though.  This is a constant condition of the human condition, and I will always feel this way. 

I wonder if everyone feels this way though?  

 Yes

What I'd like to say to you:

 You're right, I should not say you're prettier than me.  However, I suppose I did in fact think that just a second ago.  And that made me feel like you were still beautiful.   :)

 Of course, that was a bad thing to think.  Even if I find someone prettier, that does not make me any less ugly.  But I will still feel good thinking something nice about you.  

I think that this shows that no matter how beautiful someone is, you feel less bad when they are happy because they aren't as beautiful as you.
