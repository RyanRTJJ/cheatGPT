Write an entry in the text by clicking on the 'Enter text' link from the top of this page. The text will appear in the top right of all pages and will also appear on your story, so click it and select Submit. Make comments about any of the options found on the right of the post title, so don't try to tell me that they're not present to help me.

I want to make sure that you can comment on anything when I post my story on the forums. There are very few people in the world that don't have the ability to comment before I post my story. Do this right. But keep a close eye on your post's comments. When I write one, make sure I give it away before posting (I don't want to be seen submitting it, so I will keep it in the top of my book listing for several days). This way, I can keep my comments to a minimum, but when I post comments, I don't want people reading them to have to re-read them.

1). Make a statement about your experience in this case. Please read this post more carefully.

2). Take a reading of my story, so that you think about it and feel inspired to try new things.

3). Have fun writing anything you find interesting.

4). Leave comments.

5). Post in the Comments section of your story. The forum is great. I have lots of good feedback about this, so I'm posting it here.

6). Post more content to the site. Your comments will get added to the story, so
