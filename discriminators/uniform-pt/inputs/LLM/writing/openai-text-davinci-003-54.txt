It started out innocently enough. Just one small tattoo on my hip, barely visible. I didn't even remember getting it, but there it was. I ignored it for a while, not really giving it much thought. I was a little curious, sure, but nothing too serious.

But then at regular intervals I started to find more tattoos. They weren't new designs, but the same one that was already on my hip just seemed to be expanding. It seemed to be almost growing with my body, getting bigger and bigger until I realized that I had dozens of tattoos all over my body.

I didn't dare show anyone. I was scared that if my family ever found out, there would be all sorts of trouble. So I kept it hidden and went about my business as usual. Until one day when I had to go to a doctor for an unrelated issue and the doctor commented on some of the new tattoos that were appearing. He was concerned and asked a lot of questions.

That's when I decided to go to a tattoo artist and find out what was going on. I was surprised to learn that the designs were actually ancient symbols and that, in the artist's words, "they seemed to be calling for something, some kind of purpose."

I still have no idea what that purpose is, or why these tattoos keep appearing and expanding, but I am intrigued and will keep exploring this mysterious phenomenon while also keeping it hidden from prying eyes. Who knows what I might discover!
