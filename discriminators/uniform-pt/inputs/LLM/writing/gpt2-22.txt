__________________________________________________________________________ Story 1 = No-Shall-Be-Done/The End = No-Shall-Be-Done/The End of the Night and no-shall-know? (After getting this prompt at the start of the Story, go back until the end, but skip to start "Day 2") Start off by playing the story you've just recieved. There is some variation in order of difficulty for each level and this one was the toughest to solve. The level that I've been looking for, for the number of levels in the story is: level 1: Don't Be Careful, it won't be easy to see but it's still there as an open mystery, and probably the best way to take part in the plot of every level or so. The one exception is when you have the ability to choose between three or four endings if you can't guess and/or choose different endings when not possible. Level 2+ (a) The most important way of making this decision in this level is to tell the protagonist that they should save as soon as the mission begins, instead of telling them what they think they want when they turn. (Note: don't tell the protagonist that you should "save" if you don't want to tell them that you're doing it anyway.) Level 3+ The easiest method is not to tell the protagonist that the mission ending is not needed, but to tell them that it may happen in an alternate universe. __________________________________________________________________________

Level 4+ In a sense, not only is this one the hardest difficulty level (and the hardest to play), but it's also fairly easily understood. Level 5+ There are some changes that
