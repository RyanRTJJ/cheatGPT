 I read everything I could get my hands on from memoirs, biographies, and even old letters of someone who lived a long time ago.  I learned that I was an infant and I was supposed to have remembered.   It was at the age of 3 years old that I got the opportunity to go to the memory laboratory at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.   I was fascinated by the fact that I was able to remember a time period that I absolutely had not, that I was completely sure I didn't remember, yet I could remember.   Later that day I was sent to the laboratory for an exam to see if I had memories.   I knew I was supposed to have memories so I went, but my memories from that day are still vivid, but more so than the moment when I was taken to Manhattan.   It was like my mind took over my body, I don't know how it happened but it happened.   I was told I was an infant who had just begun to remember in his first year of life, but that it would take a few years to develop more specialized memories.   I was an excellent test subject as they tested all things I could tell them about my environment.  They tested my emotional awareness which meant if you told them about the last time you cried, but you didn't know what it means, you would know.   I didn't think about it much on my initial exam the first day.  They told me I could see things by looking between my toes, that if someone was standing in front of me and I didn't see them I would know they were in the rear of the room.   I'd look up and watch them and I was told it wasn't something I could do without my brain being active and explaining to my brain what I was seeing.  I could see that someone was in my classroom, but no one else could be seeing it.
