 You decide to stop swearing because you don’t want to lose your money.  The next night, you find that a dollar is missing.  But when you return the jar to the shop, you find no money in it.  You go home and there is a note attached to the jar saying, “If this jar is ever returned and no money is inside it, no one must know that it is full of money.”  Who knows about the money inside the jar?

This is a really interesting character development chapter.  We see the beginnings of the plot and the motives of each of the characters.  It seems that the main objective is to find out what is actually happening in the novel.
In regards to the beginning of Chapter 13, I get that the author is attempting to portray that she likes a good story, or possibly that she was having a really bad day (probably from the lack of sleep) but I think she is going to regret her actions (in this one line) when she hears about the money.  I’m assuming that this has something to do with the fact that the character that she’s using as an incentive or to motivate her friend to come out of his room is actually the villain that ends the book, and I’m getting the feeling that someone or something is trying to stop her from telling what happens so this scene might be to show that the character she’s using is trying to prevent her from telling.  She’s using him as an excuse to tell the truth.
