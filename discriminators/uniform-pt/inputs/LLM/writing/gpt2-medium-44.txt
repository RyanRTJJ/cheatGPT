"A good story's a fool if it doesn't end in the right place." -Foo Fighters / Mike Portnoy on the importance of story


'You are what you say you are, you're an idea that people think." -Stephen King, No Country for Old Men


"If you're gonna tell an idea, tell it right, don't be fooled in a way that people think it's dumb and overused because that's just the reality of a lot and it may not be it anymore. It may be it but you won't believe it." -James Joyce, Ulysses


"A good story starts as an idea. An idea has to begin somewhere, no question about it. A good story doesn't stop with the idea. It doesn't end either. It has to continue somewhere in order to be meaningful. The story has to move forward in order to know how to do things differently, where I don't do them but I'm just doing them. So I'm not gonna tell you what I think is gonna happen to some movie of mine. You read a few books and you read them and I say what I think." -David Cronenberg, Inglourious Basterds


"When everyone is reading the same thing, the truth can be hard to find. So think of writing the kind of book that we'll always love. It'll take me 10 years to finish it, I hope." -Carmen Sandiego, Dazed & Confused
