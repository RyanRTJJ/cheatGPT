_____________

(No story already posted with this prompt. For the third installment of this anthology, write a story that was one of your favorite books as a child. You know the type—a book that made you smile by virtue of its innocence (even though you didn't know the words, and even though you had heard only one song from the cover), and which you couldn't wait to go home and read even if you got caught in a storm on your way to bed. Make it funny. Make it sad. Make it whatever.

When you're done, e-mail me your story (preferably with a photo to prove it exists!), and I'll post it here and send you five more free stories to read—one for each of the books in the collection. (This time, though, I won't give away any of the three books that came out after the first one.)

Happy Writing! :-)

Update: Thanks to your overwhelming support, this story has reached the top three most liked stories in the anthology! That's so cool! That means you may have already found your literary role model for what I hope can become an annual tradition. Here's to hoping we will be able to do it every year.
