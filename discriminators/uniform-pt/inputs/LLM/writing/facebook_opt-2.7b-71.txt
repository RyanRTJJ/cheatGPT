  Go there, make a brief speech on why your time there should be enough, and then make your final exit.
I would probably start crying, but that's what I would do.
You could probably still leave a nice note, if that's your thing. Otherwise, I don't know...
In my mind, I already have.
Then you're golden. Good luck!
Thank you.  When they told me they wanted to send me home and let me into my apartment, that was the first time I cried in ten years.  It was a beautiful moment, even though I knew they didn't really want me anymore.  It was also an odd, sad moment, even though I knew now that I could trust them to take good care of me.  In the end, I realized they weren't keeping me prisoner anymore.  It was weird.    And thank you again.  Now I know.
I'm glad you've figured it out. You're an inspiration to me. Maybe someone will read this and realize they have the potential within them to be better.
No one could ever inspire me.  I'm a mess.    But I hope someone gets inspiration.  You should see it when I get out.  I'm moving to a cabin out in the woods.  This place has been good to me.  I love its beauty.  I still have so much to do there.  I'm still going to take a couple of my classes online to finish up, to stay connected.  And now, there is no need to be connected.  Nothing here means anything.  It's peaceful.    So, go.
That sounds amazing. Keep on writing. :)
So.  This place is huge.  I've not really explored my cabin that much, but I feel I should find some.  I feel like I was wrongfully accused of something in here.  I need closure.  I have to know who to blame.
