I've grown up like most people, thinking that I was nothing more than a walking, talking human being with a heart and a brain. I had my share of struggles and joys, my strengths and weaknesses, like anyone else. But I could never quite shake the feeling that something was missing from my life; something intangible that cast a shadow of emptiness wherever I went.

For years, I tried to quell this feeling, wondering if perhaps I was just being overly maudlin. But then, I heard a talk one day, discussing the human soul as a confirmed, measurable entity that enters everyone after birth. At last, I had an explanation for why I felt so incomplete, so hollow inside - my soul had never arrived.

At first, I was overwhelmed with despair. I felt like I was permanently stuck between life and death, an empty vessel that would never be fully alive. But then, I realized something else - the fact that I had a soul-less void inside me meant that I was truly unique in the world.

I found a way to embrace this newfound knowledge, to see my hollow place as an opportunity instead of something to fear. With this newfound understanding, I began to explore the depths of my soul, to expand my horizons, and to explore the possibilities of life.

My journey continues to this day, and more and more I find myself living a life that is filled with purpose, joy, and meaning. I am forever grateful for the void that never filled, for it has led me to the life that I am living today.
