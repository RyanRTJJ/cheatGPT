        But if you screw it up. You will always regret it.
Would love to read that, thanks for the reply!
Glad I could give you an idea 👍🍆
I’ll PM you the details later today, thanks!
Sure thing 😀👍 Please tell me if there is any feedback or additional comments you wanted me to add. Happy to pass that too.        Thank you for taking the time to write it. I'm sure you got plenty of karma out of it.
Great story!! I thought it was a good idea...very creative...very unique and it made me laugh.  I would love to know if someone is going to pick this as a story concept for a book or movie at some point in the near future.
Glad I could provide some amusement! That’s what my day is all about! :) Thanks for the comment. I wish I could give more. So far it’s my only post.
I just spent almost 2 hours reading it. Very, very good.  Don't know how it would work out as a screen play, but it definitely deserves one!
Excellent. Now I can go home and work on my next one. Thanks for reading! 🍆🎼  I really am trying to add one new post a week to my site and writing and story ideas for stories are always trickier than words and things - but if it’s not there’s a million in my head.  I hope you will let me know of any idea you may come up with!   Thanks again for your kind words and support on my site 😀
You are very welcome.  Keep up the great work.  I will definitely let you know if I come up with any good ideas and it may be some time as I want to make sure everything is done correctly.  But I’ll be sure to tell you here if I think it has the potential to go anywhere.
Please do
