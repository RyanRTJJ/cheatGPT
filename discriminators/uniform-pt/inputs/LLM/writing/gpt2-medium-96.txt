 I don't want to get all sentimental.  I think when you're watching the news right now, it's like reading a sadder version of The Avengers in which Tony Stark is the Hulk and Hulkbuster is the Thor.  This wasn't just a random event; I think everyone was feeling something, and after a while, everyone had to sit down and think about what they were feeling.   So then the news broke that the asteroid was too small to hit us; or at least, that it would have to be very small.  We didn't have time to go to the movies, so we decided to wait until the asteroid was bigger than our planet, and then we'll sit down and talk about it. But that was the plan the entire week.  Until Monday, everyone was just kind of numb to the news and never looked at it any more than we did anyway. Then Sunday was the big day in the news.  It was that asteroid that's supposed to hurt everyone and nobody's in anything to do with it.  A lot of people got depressed and ended up having a panic attack when the news came in.  They were afraid that they might not be able to return home because the news hadn't happened yet.  And the first thing they did was go to a liquor store and smoke cigarettes, hoping to save some cash.  Of course, that didn't help at all either, and they ended up having a really shitty night of drinking. We still don't know how much radiation this asteroid will have; maybe 5,000 times less than Hiroshima, or twice the dose of the Fukushima Daiichi tsunami last year.  But after reading all the articles about this, I am willing to bet we get it sooner than anyone thought we'd see.  This is just another major story for us, maybe not a big deal, but
