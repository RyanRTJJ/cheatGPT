In the far future, a group of god-like beings, the Arbiters, had decided to bestow knowledge upon humanity. They gathered together all the words said by every living being, speaking and unspoken, from the stone age to the modern era. Every utterance, from the most mundane grocery list to the most heartbreaking poem, was collected, labeled and stored. 

The Arbiters, working together in perfect harmony, used the collective wealth of knowledge to construct the Ultimate Sound. It symbolized all of humanity's thoughts, emotions, and expressions. When the Divine Sound was ready to be released, listeners around the world witnessed a remarkable marvel of sound. 

It was an awe-inspiring mix of rich tones, telling stories of untold joys, sorrows, and pain. It was an amalgamation of our collective souls, a melange of past, present and future. As the ethereal sound pierced through the air, it brought a sense of peace and stillness to the world. 

The Arbiters had once again proved their divinity. Humanity was gifted with a timeless and priceless artwork, to be cherished and shared by all. In time, the Divine Sound would continue to evoke a potent emotion, powerful enough to alter the course of history. 

It was a reminder of how powerful humanity's voice can be, when used for something beautiful and positive. And it would live on, a beacon of hope, for those who wished to listen and find solace in the ultimate sound.
