John had been living in the same neighborhood for his entire life. His parents had bought the house in the suburb long before John was born, and he couldn't remember a time when he hadn't lived there. It was a happy home, and the people in the neighborhood were friendly. 

Everyday, John went for a walk around the area and took notice of the few changes that had been made over the years. But one thing remained the same: the giant old oak tree in the center of the park. It was one of the oldest trees on the block and John had enjoyed playing in it since his childhood. 

One summer afternoon, however, John noticed something strange about the tree. Its leaves had all fallen off, and its branches were strangely twisted and contorted. What had happened? John was bewildered. 

He asked the other people in the park, but nobody seemed to know. Finally, one of his old friends, Joe, told him the secret. 

"If it makes you feel any better," Joe said, "it wasn't lightning that did that tree in. It was a local girl who used to hung around here. She had some kind of power that caused the tree to wither and die."

John was astonished but happy to know the truth. However, the following day John noticed the tree looking no different than before. 

John was confused and asked Joe what he knew about it. Joe told him that nobody knew how, but somehow the tree had come back to life.

The lie: Joe had not been telling the truth. He said the tree had come back to life, but it was still dead and withered.
