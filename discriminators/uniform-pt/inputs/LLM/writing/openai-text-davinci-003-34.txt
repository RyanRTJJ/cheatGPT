Dear Unknown,

I hope this letter finds you well and that you are enjoying life. 

You don't know me, but truthfully, for the longest time I wanted to know you. We first crossed paths one ordinary day and something about you caught my attention. It wasn't until later I realized that it was your genuine kindness that had won me over. 

I still remember the conversations we shared, how you quickly put me at ease and how your gentle kindness brightened my day. I had never been charmed by someone like you before and suddenly, I wanted to know more. 

But when it came time to introduce myself, I chickened out. I could feel the energy rising between us and truth be told, it made me nervous. So instead of introducing myself, I simply turned and went about my day.

In my mind, I thought I had made the right decision. It was best for both of us if we simply parted ways and I never looked back. But deep in my heart, I couldn't help but wonder what could have been. 

Years have passed since that fateful day and I still think about you. Even though I know it's been a long time, I still wanted to take the time today to write this letter. 

I don't expect a response and I don't want to ask you any questions. I simply wanted you to know that you left an impact on my life, if only for a moment. I hope wherever you are, you're still making a difference in other people's lives just like you had in mine. 

With utmost gratitude, 

Yours truly
