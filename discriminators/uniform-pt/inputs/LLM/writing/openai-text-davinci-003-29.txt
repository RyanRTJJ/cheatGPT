It was an ordinary night in a small suburban town. Rachel was getting ready for bed, when suddenly she heard a sound coming from her room. She stopped in her tracks and listened carefully. There it was again--a whisper coming from the corner of the room.

Rachel slowly crept toward the corner. She had to see what was making the noise. Peeking around the corner, she felt her heart stop. There, standing in the corner of the room, was a figure shrouded in a black cape. Rachel was horrified. She couldn't move or breathe.

The figure seemed to be looking right at her. Rachel felt like she was being watched. Overcome with fear, Rachel slowly stepped backward as the figure slowly glided toward her. At this point, Rachel was so scared, she felt like she couldn't move. But then the figure stopped and dropped it's cape.

There, beneath the cape, was a skeleton wearing a crown and holding a sword. Its eyes were glowing a bright green. Rachel had never seen anything like it before. The skeleton slowly began to speak in a deep and menacing voice.

"Welcome to my kingdom, Rachel. You are now my prisoner. I will be watching you, and if you do not obey me, I will come for you. Now go to bed and await my orders."

Rachel was petrified with fear. She quickly ran to her bed and hid under the covers, never taking her eyes off the skeleton. She remained hidden all night, until the morning light came and the skeleton disappeared.

Rachel never knew what happened to the skeleton, but from then on, she was sure to obey orders, always on the lookout for that creepy figure shrouded in black.
