This morning, I woke up early and decided to make myself a cup of coffee before starting my day. As I stirred the hot liquid round and round, I found myself entering a trance-like state. Noticing something unusual in my state of mind, I looked up and noticed the song playing from the radio. I can't be sure how much time I spent there, but I let the gentle melody trickle into my subconscious. 

Suddenly, I felt myself become more aware of my surroundings. My senses began to come alive and my attention turned to the smallest details - the sound of my stirring spoon against the porcelain mug, the scent of the coffee beans that escaped through the air, the warmth of the liquid against my fingertips.

The trance I had found myself in lasted what felt like hours, although it was only a few minutes in reality. By the time I snapped back to reality, I felt an odd sense of clarity. It was as though I had been given a moment of insight and understanding. I couldn't quite explain it, but I felt like I had hypnotised myself unknowingly. 

With the song still ringing in my mind, I left my kitchen with a newfound feeling of peace. I felt calmer and more focused for the day ahead. The trance I had been in had awoken a part of myself that I didn't even know existed.
