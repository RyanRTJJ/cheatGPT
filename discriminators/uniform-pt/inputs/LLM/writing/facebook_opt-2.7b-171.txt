 What would you do?
You would be forced to listen to their life story in a continuous loop.
Sounds like a nightmare.  So basically you're going to be trapped on an elevator with the president of the US for like a week?   I think you might have missed my premise.
That sounds like the ultimate in presidential torture.
I was assuming that if either of the two were elected president for life then would be stuck on an elevator with them for a week.   One would be the president for life and they would both still be able to hold their heads up. The other would be an outgoing Republican congress that just can't bear to see their party take another heavy hit from the Democrats and both would be too broken from the experience to stay in office.  So pretty much the ultimate presidential torture.
Hah, so they don't have to kill anyone? That's pretty sweet.
If it is a Republican, then they can just blame the Dems, which would pretty much force the GOP to start working together.
That's pretty much the best option at this point, yes. Although I'd be more interested to see how they'd keep the peace. I'm hoping for an epic brawl between Bernie & Trump; we're already seeing the Dems and GOP feuding.
If we have an epic brawl I hope it won't be between the two parties.
I'm pretty sure that they'd start a Civil War if they couldn't agree on an election. You know, a la 1864. I think that Bernie would love to see a civil war over his plan to "revolutionize" (his words. I'm using them too.) the economy.
They aren't going to disagree over this. This is pretty much in the bag for Hillary.  I was commenting on the idea of'solving a civil war' between both parties.  I know Republicans won't be willing to vote for Bernie.   Republicans:  Clinton  Progressives:  Sanders  Clinton would obviously win.
I'd be interested in
