I had dreaded this day my whole life. The prophecy had been given to me since I was a small child and ever since then, I had been aware of the day when I would be the one to destroy Earth. I had devoted my life to trying to prevent it, but alas, it was inevitable.

The day of reckoning finally arrived and I was surprisingly at peace with my immense task. Everyone around me shouted with dread and fear as the Apocalypse was at hand, but I felt oddly serene. My inner resolve told me that this race had taken enough and I was thankful that I could be the one to put them out of their misery.

I closed my eyes and felt a great calm come over me as I lifted my hands and sent forth the energies of destruction. The world around me trembled and shook as my powers unleashed destruction on all that was known. But somehow, I found solace amongst this chaos.

The prophecy was finally fulfilled and I was relieved. I had tried to spare this world from destruction, but in the end, it was my destiny to be the one to exact change. And it was a relief to finally fulfill it.
