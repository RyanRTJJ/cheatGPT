A:

You are given the ability to accurately assess the dangerousness of people based on only one glance.  Your challenge is to find ways to use this knowledge without coming off as creepy or being labeled as a creep.  If you find you come off as a creep, you're probably a creep.
This is a problem I've seen on TV.  The guy with the gun (and it's usually a guy with a gun) has a way of looking at people that tells them how bad he thinks they are.

A character could use this ability to measure the "danger" of any place, person, place, thing, or other creature.
