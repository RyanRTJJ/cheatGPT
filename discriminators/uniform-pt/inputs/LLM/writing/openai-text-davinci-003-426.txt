I have never been ordinary. I have always known that I was somehow different, special in a way that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Every other person around me was either too busy to notice or too scared to ask, so I held my secrets and stayed silent.

But on my eighteenth birthday something changed. My mother took me to a special place and, for the first time in my life, I saw what made me stand out from the crowd.

On my arm was a number. Not just any number, but the lowest number possible: One. 

It had been thousands of years since the world first started experimenting with imprinting a certain number on the skin of each human being born, and in that time, that number had gradually been going down, down, down with each passing generation.

I was the first.

I didn't know what it meant exactly or why it had chosen me, all I knew was that it felt special. I had a kind of power, a responsibility to be the best version of myself that I could be.

It felt like a gift and a responsibility, one that I wasn't sure I was ready for, but I was determined to make the most of it. I studied hard, worked hard, and tried to use my power for good.

It was a quiet sort of revolution, one where I changed the world in small ways that added up, and it felt good.

Every day I woke up with a purpose and I am proud of the life I have built, of the difference I have made, and of the number one still glowing on my skin.
