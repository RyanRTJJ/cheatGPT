 I think this would be a hell of an anthology.
I dunno... I'm not really comfortable with the idea of making money from someone else's ideas, and I can definitely see this being sued.
What we're really wondering is, "will the ghosts be able to see you, and hear you, while you're in there?" - I can hear my spirit guide saying "I can't see you; I don't exist", so if I can hear him, he'll know it too :-). That would be an awesome experience.
I think that was the original question. There's no doubt ghosts can sense you, but they aren't usually actively trying to listen.
The first thing I thought of was Paranormal Activity, but I wasn't sure if that was a realistic interpretation of reality. Thanks!
Yes, well, in reality, they can detect your presence in the room, so yeah, that would be a good choice. I personally like the more realistic ideas, though. You could definitely make a lot of money with this one.
In one of the Paranormal Activity movies, the people on the Ghost Adventures show tried to communicate with the ghost of the little boy who died, and all he could hear was the sound of his dead little brother crying.
Well, obviously the kids were trying to communicate with him... It's not his brother anymore, and he's a ghost. It doesn't mean he wasn't trying to communicate! This is why I love documentaries, they make me more aware of the realities of the paranormal. I really should've expected an answer like that though. :)
I'm not trying to attack a documentary series. Just saying that the reality might not jive with the reality of ghost investigations, like the little boy you mentioned.
