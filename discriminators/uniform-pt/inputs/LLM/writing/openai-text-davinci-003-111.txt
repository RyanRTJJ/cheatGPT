Alice has been reading the same chapter of a book every night for years. She believes it's her favorite book; she reads it slowly, relishing every sentence as if it were an old friend.

But recently, she's had a nagging feeling that something odd is going on. No matter how many nights she reads the same chapter, she never seems to make any progress, and she can't help but think that the ending of the book is eluding her.

Alice decides to do some digging and discovers that the final chapter of the book is missing. Apparently, she's been following a fiction that was never completed — a cruel trick of fate.

Alice can't help feeling a little cheated. She'd invested so much in this story, investing time and emotion in her beloved characters as they traveled ever forward on their adventure.

Alice decides to take matters into her own hands. She goes through each page of the book, picking up where the author left off, filling in the blanks with her own imaginings until she suddenly looks up at her clock one night and realizes she has been writing for hours, and she has crafted her own ending.

The story she created was everything she'd wanted the book to be — and more. She'd managed to give closure to the characters she had grown to love, and more importantly, closure to herself.

While she may never know what the author originally intended, Alice can take comfort in the fact that it doesn't matter. She created her own perfect ending — one she will proudly read every night before bed for years to come.
