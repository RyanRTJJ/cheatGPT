In reality, my last name is spelled as O'Brien, but I've used this
  name professionally for almost my whole career. I have been called
  Pat O'Bien (Pat in the middle) the whole time I've been in this
  company.
-My experience in this company is about half being Pat O'Brien and
  half William O'Brien, but some people even confuse them because of
  the way my name is spelled.

A true story.

I always have dreams. The ones I dream about are about a boy who lives in the same house as me. He's a few years younger than me and he likes to tease me. He's good at it. I know he can do it since in a previous dream a boy did one thing and I didn't and I asked him and he explained all the little things I had done wrong and that was it. And I said to myself that if I was just half as good as this boy he was about half of it and I shouldn't have been getting beat up so often at home that was all he had to do in the dream that he stopped getting beat up. In my dream I was in the middle of telling of getting beaten up when I woke up and remembered thinking that I dreamt of this boy the first time after my wife had a heart attack and I had dreams about her a lot too back then. I went in my wife's room and she was awake in the bed and I asked her what happened and she told me. And that was the dream that woke me up that I wrote in.
