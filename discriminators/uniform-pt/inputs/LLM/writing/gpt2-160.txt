 Don't be the villain. But don't just be the bad guy. The comic can't tell the difference between a hero's true powers and his true abilities. Or, worse even, you might have a strong negative effect on the world.  How much will happen to these negative effects will be a mystery to Marvel creators, but they could become extremely popular with readers. A series that uses two heroes as antagonists would also be a good start to another kind of comic.  They could make their own rules from here.
Some other suggestions:  The Marvel Code of Conduct is well written.  This would have become a great medium for creating an example for other comics to follow, especially when the issues have to show a story that might not be in any comic books in the future.  But of note, with new material, a book that is all about characters like Thor doesn't appear to have anything to do with character.  The issues just look good.  I've been working on a follow up book for about a month trying to figure out why this story wouldn't work at all.  As far as I can tell it doesn't look like a major crossover.  I hope for a few more adventures from that story.  I'm probably going to start seeing these in the first few issues but what happens in the next few days is hard to predict.  I feel that I could hit out on a few books with a different premise which is more likely to be good, but in a place where a new one is coming.  It's possible they could really happen next chapter or two.  I hope they have more time since coming to this comic.
To begin, I really want to thank Steve Zaun for a great editorial process, and all of the other writers out there.  You will need to go to his website for more information and his awesome writing staff in the comments.    I also want to thank the editor and publisher Kevin B. Boudreaux for the awesome comics he worked
