A zombie body goes into his basement, and sees another zombie watching himself kill his family, he’s about to kill him, but then the zombie’s head turns into a normal person body; the normal person body goes into the house of a couple, and watches his wife and daughter being murdered by the zombie. He gets back into his body, and runs out of the house. He goes back into his own head watching the events as he tries to figure out what happened, what is going on?

I think this is a little bit too much of a stretch. There's nothing special about the body, even if it was able to transform. The problem is that the person's body is dead, so it's a zombie and he's still dead. There's nothing to suggest his mind is still watching what this other self is doing, or the other body is able to move and interact.
A better way to put this would be as a character, who is himself dead, but who has lived several lives, and one of them saw what he did, and doesn't want to let that happen again.

So let's assume that you don't have to explain where
