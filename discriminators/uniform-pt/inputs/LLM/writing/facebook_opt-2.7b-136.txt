 What do you do as an outlaw in this world? What drives you? What was your choice?
What do you mean by "The only punishment is the birth penalty?"
If you're born into this world, you are immediately banished by the law. If you are a child, for example, and you are raised by other people, then you can't marry another human in this world. There are two things that happen if you don't meet these conditions: 1) you never even get to experience the world for yourself; 2) you go back to the realm of the dead.
So if you were to be born into this world, you would definitely die from heart failure?
If you were born into this world you wouldn't be on the subreddit
But what am I doing here?
You're here because you like the sub, not your karma  Maybe you come here to kill time
If not my karma, what is this sub even for?
To kill time with shitposts  Why is it so important how big your karma got? You won't even see that number
So it's just like any community on Reddit, except it's shitpost central.
I get the feeling this is what a shitpost looks like
This is the only subreddit I use where shitposts aren't banned
Shitposts are banned in /r/shittyaskscience
But not here!
This is the only community I use where the comments are more interesting than the posts
There's no comments in /r/futurology
But there are on here
There shouldn't be any on threads that the mods are looking at
What if I don't comment in this thread? What then?
Then you're a part of this sub's dark side
