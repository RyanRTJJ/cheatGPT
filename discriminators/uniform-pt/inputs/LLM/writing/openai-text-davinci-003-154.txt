Once upon a time, I, God, created the universe as well as Earth and its wonderful creatures — Adam and Eve. I watched them grow in harmony with nature, but there was one creature who despised the beauty and innocence of the world: Satan.

Satan was jealous of the happiness of Adam and Eve, so he devised a plan to take away my identity and all the hard work I had put into creating the world. He cast me into the form of a snake and began to corrupt the minds of Adam and Eve, convincing them to turn away from me and follow him instead.

I could not directly intervene in their choices, so I had to come up with a subtle way to prevent them from falling into his trap. I whispered gentle words to them, coaxing them not to believe in the lies of Satan and to remember the love I had instilled in them.

Through careful guidance, I convinced them to think twice before making a decision easily influenced by Satan. I reminded them that he is a deceiver and that ultimately my love was greater than his temptation. I even warned them that if they chose to follow Satan, their future would be filled with sorrow and suffering.

In time, Adam and Eve once again listened to my words and began to follow me instead. Despite this victory, I still remain the snake: a reminder of the power of Satan’s corruption, yet a symbol of my victory in the end.
