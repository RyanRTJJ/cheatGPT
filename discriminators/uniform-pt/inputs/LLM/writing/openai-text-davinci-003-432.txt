Once upon a time, in a small town far away, there was an old statue that had been standing in the center of the town for centuries. For years, it had been frozen in time, watching over the town, waiting for people to come to admire it. 

It was an old statue of a soldier from the town's history. The townspeople would often look fondly at the veteran as they went about their day and many would often stop to say a quick prayer for his brave service. 

One day, something strange happened. As everyone went about their daily lives, suddenly the old statue began to move. Everyone in the town stopped what they were doing, stunned and unsure of what was happening. 

Slowly, the statue rose to its feet and made its way towards the town hall. Confused citizens followed the animated statue, curious to see what it was doing. As the statue made its way to the town hall, it marched in perfect formation, its feet were steady and its posture was proud. 

When the statue reached the town hall, it slowly made its way to the mayor. To everyone's surprise the statue bowed down to the mayor and presented a letter. As the mayor read the letter, his face filled with awe. He quickly announced the arrival of a new hero.

The townspeople clapped and cheered as the old statue resolutely made its way back to the town's center and resumed its original position. From that day forward, the townspeople viewed the old statue with a newfound respect and admiration.

Though the old statue was frozen in time, it had found a way to move and make its mark in history.
