How this image was made:

I made this image in the 'Make a cool-looking painting' category! If you don't have any Photoshop / Sketch or Illustrator experience, or just want to try it and learn a new aspect in the free painting tool, here is how I learned it;

For free art you need to create a composition that allows the viewer to observe the art at its best without interruption. The most important part to create this "composition" is to find what is unique to your images. This is when you will notice some things that may be the reason behind your image's beauty. You'll realize what's important when you find the key of your art.

And one of the way to find the key is to use one of these techniques. I'll use the composition technique for this image. I wanted my image to have an artistic quality while being unique in composition. In this image the main focal point is the yellow bird that's standing outside the windows. Using a composition technique is like placing the viewer's attention to the focal point and keeping it undisturbed. If you are looking at the yellow bird, then the yellow bird will act as a focal point. It will make the image complete.

This bird image has many focal points; It's one of many that makes the image complete. You make the image unique, when you can give it a composition design that focuses on one of the key-features of that image. Like the yellow bird above, this image has several different focal points: its light, the horizon line, the sky and the colors of the clouds. These focal points make your image complete, in my view. As simple as it may sound, you need to realize that a complete and unique image will be a result of a well-crafted, unique and proper composition.
