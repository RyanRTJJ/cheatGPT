  Your story is to end with "God has left the building."
I'll try that! A twist would make most of the plot a fantasy novel but still interesting. Will I still need a disclaimer or something somewhere?
No, you don't need to, as long as it is not considered blasphemous.
In addition, it may serve as a good subtext, if you like.  *"The atheist has been slain in battle by a devout Christian!"*  The religious zealotry of the times may make it a "tough" sell on the title, but I think it might be worthwhile.
If you're an atheist like me, it might be even more important. A lot of Christians I know are afraid of atheists, so I'd say this would be good for promoting tolerance.
Exactly, that's why that line might work.  Thanks.
I'm glad you made it work. I really like your story, I'll definitely read it if I ever have the time.
Just made another submission to /r/NoSTupidQuestions. I'll let you know if it goes through, or if I post it there.  Thanks for reading! It means a lot.
I checked it out and it didn't work. It might work just in some subreddits. For the meantime, do you have a story in mind for this prompt again? It might work on /r/writingprompts.
I did. I used the same prompt. "A man, alone but determined, searches for the truth." Then it just made me want to write something with an open-mind story-telling.
Ah, that does sound pretty good. I think it would work there.
Good to know.  Thank you again. I hope you see my new one.
Of course! I hope I can reply soon. In the meantime, if you have any other ideas, let me know.
I like a dark story with a twist, a bit more of a sci-fi setting, if that sounds right. No magic, but
