It seemed like a scene straight out of a cartoon; everyone walking the street all wearing the same set of clothes like a uniform. It had been like this for as long as anyone could remember; that's the way it was and no one questioned it, everybody accepted it without dissent.

That is, until he showed up. His name was Andrew and he was an enigma to the residents of the small town; he never wore the same set of clothes twice. Every day he shocked the townspeople with his ever-changing looks; thick rimmed glasses one day, and a mismatched shirt and pants the next. People gasped and murmured as they saw his daily new outfit and soon, the whole town was talking about him.

Everyone wanted to know why he wore different clothes every day, and soon enough, Andrew was forced to tell them. He explained that he believed everybody should have the freedom to choose how they want to dress, and should never be forced to conform to a single look for their entire lives.

He insisted that it was unfair for people to only be allowed to wear one set of clothes for life, unless they physically outgrew it. Some still disagreed with him, but many people in the town were inspired and began to take his lead. They were tired of the same boring look and embraced Andrew's idea of expressing themselves through their clothing.

Before long, the entire town was wearing different clothes each day, and they no longer felt the same pressure to conform. Everyone thanked Andrew and admired his strength and courage for standing up for what he believed in, and now, the town celebrates their freedom every year in his honor.
