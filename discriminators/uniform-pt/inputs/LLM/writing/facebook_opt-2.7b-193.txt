  Then you find that the jar looks like an eyesore and there's a giant spider inside. Now the jar is the object of your obsession. It's all you're interested in.

I hope you enjoy the idea, and remember to use proper writing forms.   Good luck!
Thanks! I've done short stories in middle school I suppose I just need to go back and think of ways I can write them in the style I want to
As always, have an idea in your mind like that. Then write it to an extent that makes sense to you. Maybe get the feeling of how it comes out of you as a reader. Don't fall into patterns or be too hard on yourself, the world needs imagination.   Best to you!
Oh I'm not worried because I'll be really excited to work on it lol. But thank you so much for the advice!
I'm right there with you. Let's make it happen.
Hahahaha I'm so nervous writing this story ðŸ˜‚
No matter how much you make it scary, it has to be exciting for your reader.
Oh don't worry about that haha I've done my part I am scared af but it's for a great reason so I'm doing it lmao.
So then don't be hard on yourself and try to go from there. Good luck!
