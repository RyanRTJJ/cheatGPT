 [ NA or OOC ] Jay Gatsby sees his vision of Daisy fulfilled only he and Daisy are very unhappy.  Tell me how that sounds okay?
I think that's a nice summary of the story, OP. Nicely done.
Thank you! I'm definitely not a writer, ha ha. But I did put a lot of detail into each. I hope they turn out nice!
Well if you keep at it you'll be getting better with time.
Thanks! I hope so too! :) I'm planning on posting all of them at once so anyone who's finished reading might be able to review them all while I'm planning out what the next chapter will be.
Nice, I'm looking forward to it!
I plan on posting next in ~2 weeks!
Awesome I hope that works out for you and I look forward to it!
It will! But I got to write it in all its glory before it leaks out of here.
You got it! Hope to be reading soon!
Thanks! :) I'll post it as soon as it's up and running. I might work on a couple of the stories in succession to help keep me motivated but I'll make sure to do a new chapter once I'm finished with them.
I look forward to it!!
Thanks! There ya go!
I'm excited to read it!!
Aww you're awesome, thanks! :) Enjoy reading!
I will! I hope everyone enjoyed them!! I look forward to hearing what you think.   PS: Any last notes OP?
Thank you! You wrote very well I look forward to reading more of them!  No no last and best note:  >The party moves to an ocean side beach where everyone throws their clothing into the sea.
Wow that's so good. I actually teared up and it's very well done, OP. The last note was almost a cliff hanger, ha ha. But I do love the first and third, too!
