 Can you solve this murder?
I like this.   A really cool version would be a horror game where it's a single character that you choose to save, and they have the ability to become super powerful.

So, you wouldn't play as the 1 that saves them. You would play as the bad guy that tries to make a power play and destroy the 1. :P
