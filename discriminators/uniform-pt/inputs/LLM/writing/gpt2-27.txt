 However, all the sudden, something goes wrong with his car. A video shot from the right shows him hitting the wall of the car, causing it to spin around on its side.  He then starts to get up, but is suddenly stopped from leaving his car by the police or the car being left behind.  This is the moment you probably thought your car would be moving like you did on an abandoned building.  Here's the whole video of the car driving around.
I took my first few pictures of this video, then pulled the video box out of the car, and put a video camera in it.  I called a friend's friend to check it out.  She said that once they noticed the video box was in the car and that it was a regular block or a small house, it was probably just a case of them deciding from time to time not to pay attention to the police.
I looked at the block, and here, in the middle of the block, it was covered in traffic lights.  It looked pretty dark.  I told my friend I was going over into the alley where I lived, to look into the video screen, and, of course, she pointed my camera directly out of the middle of the alley, and called 911. While most people on the street or in the car could see this, it just wasn't visible to anyone else at the time.  Because the video video was not visible from the block I was trying to get the car to move, I wasn't sure if anybody still was around.
This morning, police called, and made me a special report about this block.  They say that the video will never be released because it was taken by a friend (and not a criminal case).
