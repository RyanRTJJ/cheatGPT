______________ is on vacation this summer (and you really can't blame them!). What do you do when one of your employees stops by your office one day at the start of the summer? Do you just ignore him and hope that you remember in time to stop him? Do you get a little excited and say, "Look, it's August! How about we have some fun in the summer?" Or do you go to that button hidden in your desk and just click it?

Why was he hiding the button? Because he was so busy he didn't have time to enjoy the summer. If you go away for the summer, you get the same benefit, don't you? "I'm going vacation crazy, and you're going vacation crazy. Let's enjoy ourselves!"

Of course, there's always one exception to this: If you're expecting a child on vacation, it's hard to stop yourself from being a little preoccupied. You can still get out of town with the "I don't care" attitude some of us have on vacation. You can even go away for weeks at a time. Remember that. As we go through this journey of life, we must always remember to be an adult on vacation. It isn't that hard. I promise you that.

It's like when I was a little boy. I can't tell you that I actually went to camp, because I didn't, but there was a time when I could. I used to go away to summer camp every summer, and after my brothers and I got older, my father put up a tent with us for a vacation in the woods. And the woods were, are, and forever will be amazing. Now, I don't care about the woods,
