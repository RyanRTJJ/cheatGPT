 

The rules for writing a story:

  1. Write a 1000-word post including a quote.  
  2. You can submit more than one paragraph, but you must include at least 2 examples of your post and your quote (if you don't have pictures, you must include your quote), and at least one paragraph must be dedicated to the prompt, including at least a description of the dystopian world that the writer is writing about.  
  3. Post in this thread!    

For any further questions, don't hesitate to ask.

Best,

GÃ¼nter
