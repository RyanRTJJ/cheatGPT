It was the biggest dilemma of my life. A week after my grandmother was diagnosed with a terminal illness, I stumbled across its cure. According to some ancient text I had been studying, the only way to save her was to kill someone else.

I was horrified. To rid one life at the cost of another would be a grave moral error. Even though I loved my grandmother deeply, I couldn't force myself to commit such an act.

But as days passed and her health deteriorated, I found myself struggling to come to terms with my decision. She was my entire world and it was so hard—even impossible—to watch her slip away.

When I finally told her of the cure, she refused. She was the one who had raised me and taught me right from wrong, but she said that no amount of suffering could ever justify sacrificing another innocent life.

I was caught in an emotional tug of war. I wanted to spare her from the pain, to do anything and everything to save her, but in my heart I knew that eventually I would have to let her go.

In the end, I chose to honor my grandmother's wishes. Although it pained me to see her suffer and eventually succumb to the illness, I'm glad that I was able to remain true to my conscience. I know that my grandmother would be proud of me for making the right choice.
