The first Europeans to set foot in the new world were amazed at what they found. Every explorer, sailor, and merchant had heard tales of the new land, with its wealth and its mysteries, but no one had expected to find the world so changed.

The most unexpected change was the sight in the sky. No one had ever mentioned the Moon, or the peculiar fact that it was now only viewable from either North or South America.

This affected the Native American tribes, who saw the Moon as sacred; they believed it was a sign of their Great Spirit's favor, and as such, believed that the Europeans were special in His eyes. In the centuries that followed, the Native Americans saw other signs as well-- new lands, strange animals, and even a great bird that circled the sky-- but none of these eclipsed the awe and respect that the tidally locked moon evoked. 

The Europeans soon began to tell tales of their own, beyond those of the strange new land. These stories were of the Moon, of its significance in their otherwise seafaring lives, and of the new place where the sky lit up with a perpetual silver glow. 

As the years passed and the Europeans spread throughout the new world, they became an integral part of the New World mythos. From North America to South America, they were known as the ones who brought knowledge of the mysterious, tidally-locked Moon to the New World.
