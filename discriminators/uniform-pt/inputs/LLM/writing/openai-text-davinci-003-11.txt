Scottie trudged his way along the street, struggling to keep his backpack from dragging him down with each step. He had been walking for what seemed like hours, although he had long since stopped counting the blocks. For months, his life had been full of uncertainty and heartache — he had been set adrift with nowhere to turn and no one to call.

Tonight, something different was in the cards. Tucked away in a side street, Scottie spotted the address he had been searching for — a small one-room building with a faint light flickering from within. He had been given the address by a friend of one of his old teachers, and while he wasn’t sure what to expect, he knew his time was running out. 

Taking a deep breath, Scottie stepped through the door and was immediately met with a warmth and familiarity he hadn’t felt in months. The room was cosy and inviting, and in the corner was a small bed and a set of fresh sheets. As he made his way closer, he noticed a table covered in food, freshly prepared and ready for him to enjoy.

With a sigh of relief, he settled onto the bed and looked around the room. This wasn’t home, but it would do.
