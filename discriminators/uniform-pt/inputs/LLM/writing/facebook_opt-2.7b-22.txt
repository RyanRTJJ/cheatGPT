  Don't take this seriously, you don't even need to get in character with it, just be really descriptive.
Or even just be descriptive in general, like you describe a movie/show/book that you just finished or something as you write. It makes it easier to visualize the setting when you're describing things like scenery and the way you feel about it.
Oh totally, I was just being silly. Thanks.
Just trying to help, so no problem. :)
Oh man, I think I just got the most creative story idea of the year.
Heh, I'm glad the prompt helped spark creativity though. :D
A man can have more than one idea at a time, right? Right?
If only I wasn't working on all of the other ideas. :P
There's a good chance that I don't have enough brain cells in my head anyway.
Hey, you could always use them to write awesome writing prompts!
Oh I don't think I'm quite ready to do that just yet. Lol it's not that I *never* write them, it's that the subject matter is usually more complicated than stuff like "I'm in a relationship, so am I a lesbian or bisexual?".
Oooh, yeah, I feel you. Sometimes, I get so bored with my own characters, it's hard for me to write them for at least an hour, let alone a whole book.
Haha, I'd be writing a novel if I wasn't so lazy. I've gotten as far as the first chapter before, but then I got the urge to play another game and forgot about that.
I get those kinds of moments, but they don't stop me from starting a new book every so often.
Yeah, I'm still reading the book I got three years ago to finish, but I have no idea how long it'll take me until I'm done, lol.
Ha, I actually did that, too. That was the last book of the Percy Jackson Series, right? lol
Heh, close! I did just finish reading the second book of the Hunger Games.
Okay,
