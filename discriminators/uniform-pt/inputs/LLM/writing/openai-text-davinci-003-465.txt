It was the mission of all humanity; to explore the stars in search of life beyond our own planet. Little did we know that this would be a fateful endeavor.

I was a proud part of expedition, part of the research team on board a science ship, journeying through space. After weeks of exploration, we encountered the first signs of alien existence. Our anticipation grew as we apprehensively ventured deeper into what seemed to be a foreign new world.

What we found was not what we had expected. Everywhere we looked, we found evidence of a once thriving alien civilization but nothing of the inhabitants themselves. We found remains of massive structures and technology, some of which seemed advanced beyond our own. It was a mystery; what had happened to this society?

As our expedition stretched on, we discovered the answer. Everywhere we went, the alien civilizations we encountered had mysteriously died out. It seemed that every time mankind had ventured into outer space, a great disaster had happened.

It had been too much for most civilizations. Our exploration had marked the end of each species and their world.

We returned to Earth shaken but with the utmost respect for the limits of all civilizations. Mankind had been warned and our expedition had been a necessary but bitter reminder of the consequences of our actions. We could now only hope that we, too, would not be next.
