_____________________My name is Jack. I am very proud of the fact that I am a huge Star Wars fan. I love everything about it. Even the movies.

As you probably know, some fans prefer the original Star Wars trilogy to the prequels. For me, the prequels were awful. I felt nothing for them. And why did they want me to like something so horrible? I loved Han Solo and Lando Calrissian. In the original the Force was a good thing, whereas in the prequels it was a bad thing, the universe was evil, nothing good ever came from the Force. And I believe that is the reason why the prequels failed so very, very badly.

Even when I was alive, people would come up to me and say, "Oh my god, I am soooo happy I saw the prequels because I loved the original series because Han and Lando..." I wasn't like that. But in the spirit of giving a tribute to the best of the series... I decided to create my version of a best-of-the trilogy best-of book, without having to use the original.

I hope you enjoy your journey through all three of the Star Wars prequels. In particular I hope you like the characters and the relationships. And I hope you learn at least one thing from everything I’ve discussed about the prequels, even the ones which didn’t turn out well.

-Jack
