  You will be amazed at how fun it is.
I did that one. It was fun, but kind of depressing when I realized that there were, in fact, no aliens.
Just a heads up, that's not really a prompt. It's just a suggestion by a user. But do you want to do more of these, or not?
If you had read my comment, you would have seen that I said that is actually a prompt.  I was playing around with words.  I'm pretty sure that I'll be writing more, though.  Probably more along the lines of a "what if" or "what if you lived" prompt.
Oh, yeah, my bad, not a prompt! Cool! And yeah, I would encourage that. I hope you write more, haha. But really, I'm not trying to be mean, haha. I'm just encouraging more people to do this. It's honestly not a hard thing, it just takes some concentration. And there are definitely some great results out there.
Don't worry, I don't do well with concentration, and I definitely don't have any writing talent.  :P
I've found that I'm good at concentration if it involves things like taking pictures :P
I can't get that focused.  I'll think of something to take a picture of, take the picture, and then forget all about doing it for 10 mins.
I just realized that that's how I work too! Good minds think alike!
I am also a "think about this for 10 min and then forget about it for 10 mins" person.  For example, right now, I am thinking about posting a thread to ask what is the best, or most versatile "go to" recipe for making pasta.  For 10 min I'll tell you exactly, and by the end of that time I'll want to never think about it again.  For me being on reddit, this could be a great time to make pasta.
That's when reddit becomes interesting. The search bar.
