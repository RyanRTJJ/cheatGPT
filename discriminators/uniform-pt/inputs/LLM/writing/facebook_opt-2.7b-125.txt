 The scientists rush out of the room.  What do you do?
I could write a book about that, haha.
Yeah, I feel I'd get too into it.  I've actually got two ideas for writing a book that would definitely qualify: they'd be an illustrated encyclopedia and a graphic novel.  I think if you could go into detail and include as much detail about everything that happened with science behind the scene as you could it would make a fantastic book.
Sounds interesting, would love to know more! PM me!   Would love to read both of them.
No, seriously!  PM me please! hahaha
I PM you! I have the book about the moon landings and the dinosaurs, and I love them both so I'll send you my email if you want to PM me!
Would love some! Send a PM to the address in this post.  If you have it in Word or PDF format that would be awesome! Thanks so much!!
PMd! My inbox is a mess as I'm a new redditor and haven't gone through the rules. Also, I'm on mobile and I can't use PMs for some reason....
Nuuugh.  How can you tell they're in Word or PDF format????  I have a bunch of Word, but I have no idea what PDF even is.  I also can't figure out how to send you one.  If you can figure that out let me know please too!  Thanks for your help!
I know the PDF format because I have a scanner and a tablet with word.
I'm still having trouble with this.  I can't find the way to PM.  Can you show me the PM feature?  I'm really new to this whole Reddit thing!
