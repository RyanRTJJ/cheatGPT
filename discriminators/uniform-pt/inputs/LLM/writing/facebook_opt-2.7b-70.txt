i'm thinking of writing a short story a la 2001 a Space Odyssey but with people who wear the skin of dead robots.
That'd be pretty cool actually, could be an interesting story in and of it's own...
I always find myself going back to it when i feel like doing that. I'd like to write a full-length novel one day, but that seems pretty unrealistic until I really get the hang of writing fantasy. I think this prompt might have made me step out of my comfort zone and explore something a little more out there.
Yeah that's a really good idea! You could get into a dystopian setting, write a bit about the people, the technology, etc... It'd be great actually
Well, I think I'm going to write something on the subject. My goal in getting into fantasy is to have a new goal to work towards, and this seems like it might fit the bill.
Great! Yeah if it's the right genre of story and you have the ideas you can go anywhere :)
I think it will be set in a post-apocalyptic world, where the only technology is electronic skin, as well as a robot army. I've actually been looking at the book, Foundation by Isaac Asimov, which is supposed to be the precursor of this, so that could help.
Well great! I'd check it out, but I'm afraid the book's been around for decades and I'm too lazy to look it up...   So what are you actually writing about?
Well, my ultimate goal in writing is to create a fantasy epic with an overarching storyline and an interesting world of characters to explore. I figure this is a great way to do that.
Ya that'd be really cool
