Why would we ask questions that are already written? 
We should be making new ones!

A:

Please don't go to work.

Write a story with someone that is your main character trying to avoid work. Then you'll likely need to use "please don't" before going to work. I think in this case "please don't go to work" works as a sentence and I don't need to say "please" because the first part of the sentence has it.

 If you're trying to get him to a work party, you'll need to use please to get him there.

You know I don't like to work either. We can avoid it together.

I think you're trying to talk to your partner and be nice at the same time. So you'll need to start with please as in the first example and then talk about what you don't like about work, but you still need to end with an a bit of a sentence.

 If you start with "You know I don't like to work either", you might end with something like "But you don't even have a real job. You just sleep all day." Even though this is true, don't start a sentence with "But". This is a really long sentence and it's wordy. It could work if you were just expressing a feeling, but if you actually want to tell your partner a story, you don't want to use too many words.

 "I really don't want to work either and you don't want to either, we can avoid it together."

As it usually goes in a movie, when a guy is thinking he will try to avoid work in the morning, the girl, instead of thinking of him, doesn't go into work.

If you really want to create a story and give an explanation then don
