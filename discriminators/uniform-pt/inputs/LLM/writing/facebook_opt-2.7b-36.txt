 No more details.
> A young child stumbles upon a serial killer dumping a body in the woods.  It's like they're trying to say that the world isn't already so bleak that all the horror is contained in a dark forest.
Or they just want to write a story and have no idea how to get started.   If that's the case, a more realistic way to start would be for him to pick the perfect weapon for his first murder.  Something sharp, hard, and that can stay hidden.
That's also a pretty obvious and straightforward approach I'd say. Like I would actually consider that the easiest and most plausible of all the possible approaches.
Or maybe he is some sort of murderer, and just happens to be in my woods.  You don't know me. Or the kid. That's why I'd take the risk. Just to make sure you're afraid.  Now we know what that guy is going to use on his victims.
Why would he want to do that?
Why would he want to be feared? That might get him a little bit of attention once the police find him. But what if he doesn't want any attention? Or maybe he doesn't want to be known at all.   Or maybe he just wants to kill some fucking people. What if he just wants to watch it happen. Like, what if he's just there in reality watching it and he just doesn't want to get to involved in it.
All of those things aren't scary.  They're all rather mundane.  The only one that might work is the last.  If we know the killer wants to be feared then we know he won't do anything too drastic which, in turn, makes him more or less predictable.    So.  That'd be boring as fuck.  I don't care who he's terrified of.  That's only going to make me more or less bored.
Well, maybe. Maybe not.
Who am I to say, then?  You've obviously got it under control.
Yeah because I'm just guessing and you're not going to just sit
