A:

You're probably looking for the following: 
If you read The Stand you'll recall how the final battle takes place in one of the old buildings of a state hospital. The building has a special sort of cell with two large doors. One of the doors leads to hell, the next one leads to heaven.
A couple of days before the final battle the hero is in a room in this building. While he's dreaming he gets a little visit from his future son (named Stanley in the book, too) who explains who the hell is doing him for the whole evil business (his parents in the future, the ones who gave him the book, also). He tells the hero that after he wakes up he'll meet his parents. And in a way, the hero does get to see his parents in two days...

 as it turns out they have another child, a daughter.

Now, let's go back to the book. Remember that when the hero finds out about the cell with the two doors he says he'll ask his friends (the people he calls them) what they think. And his friends say they would like to be there for the moment. Later on the hero does exactly that and he goes to get the girl (the child, I mean). He goes there and, of course, her parents are also there. But... 

 they are his parents, from the future. 

And as it turns out they have another child, again: 

 a daughter.

I hope this helps.

 
 
Note how it was a short story. I thought about it to longer. And this is the answer I found. I don't want to claim that the story of the cell with the door is the "story" I'm talking about (like the writer in the movie "Stand by me" is) because it's not (I found it myself), but if the two stories (this one and the movie) belong to a whole world, it still
