 He was not warm at all, but he will remember you and want to spend time with you. It's your job to make him remember you: You want to find something he remembers about you but doesn't realize.  This could be a name, picture, something.  He remembers you as a kind, loving, person.  Or, if he's really lucky, a place: a hotel room, a restaurant, a church, an ice-skating rink. 
Be open to making this prompt work, at least to some degree.  Most of us are familiar with the concept of "cringing" a bit. Here's a tip for anyone suffering in your relationship: Give it a little try. If you just stand off and stare at your lover, or stare blankly and say "Nothing," there's no guarantee he'll remember you.  But if you start a conversation and you're talking about yourself, you should know that he's going to remember you. 
And that is the whole purpose for this prompt.  To get all the love out of him. Let him remember you.  This is a good time to find things that can be reminders, if he says it's not important. 
If you want him to remember what you're saying, ask him if he remembers you.  "Remember what we discussed today?"  "Are you happy today?"  Do you remember what we talked about today?  "Wow, that's what we agreed for the night? That's awesome.  I agree, that sounded great.  I love this show..."  "I love you, too!"  Or, better yet, simply compliment him:  "You are really beautiful.  You are so pretty.  I'm so very grateful to have a partner like you.  I'm really lucky too, to have a wonderful partner like you.  Thank you for having me," You never know.  He may remember it all right away, and love you for it. It's really that simple.
