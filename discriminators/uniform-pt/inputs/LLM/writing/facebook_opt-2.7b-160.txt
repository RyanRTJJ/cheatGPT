  What would your life be like? How would you survive or face certain dangers?  Be sure to add "Boom Boom Bop" by BoB to the list of songs.
I love music as a storyteller. This idea got stuck in my head today, so I jotted it down. I really like the song and how powerful it is, but there's absolutely no way I could possibly write it in prose without making it sound stupid.  It's not stupid to write a story about a hero who doesn't have superpowers, right? I will start writing one! Let's hope I can come up with a decent story!
It's not stupid either way. It can be a little easier to write if the character isn't very powerful. It's more a challenge, so be sure to be creative!  Good luck. It'll be a great story.
Thanks for the encouragement! I like to think I'm pretty creative!   I've gotten quite a bit of ideas rolling around in my head, so far. It'll be a fun week! :)
I definitely recommend just throwing one idea out there and see how it goes.  It's the best way to improve as a writer.
This is also a solid plan. I haven't committed to anything yet, though, just wanted to make the first move. :)
Keep at it!  After you have a little foundation, add on more things and keep going.    It will get easier as you write more and your confidence increases.
Thanks for the encouragement! :) I really hope this works out!!
It won't always be easy or exciting, but it will feel like it was worth it as the story comes to fruition.  Good luck.
