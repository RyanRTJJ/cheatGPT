Alice had always been a dreamer. When she was a child she would lead her friends in epic adventures that felt so real, like they were actually living them. As she got older, Alice developed an affinity and understanding of Quantum Physics that went beyond simple explanations.

One day, while studying a particularly difficult equation, Alice experienced a quantum reality bending event and suddenly found herself standing in a strange new world. The sky was a deep purple hue and the ground was like an ever-shifting sea of quicksilver. Everything around her seemed to be bend and twist in a way that seemed oddly familiar yet completely foreign.

Alice looked around in awe and bewilderment as she tried to make sense of where she might be. Suddenly, a voice rang out from behind her. Startled, she turned around to find an exact duplicate of her standing a few feet away.

The other Alice opened her mouth to speak and the two were immediately able to understand one another, as if they had known each other for a lifetime. The other Alice quickly introduced herself, explaining that she was from a parallel Earth in a different universe, which had been pulled into our own through the quantum reality bending event.

Alice was ever so curious as to what her alternate self's life had been like, and what knowledge she might be able to gain from their interaction. The other Alice explained that while they shared many similarities such as physical features and even their schooling, their lives had been very different in numerous ways.

Both Alice's quickly became fast friends and exchanged knowledge and ideas of their respective worlds. They compared and contrasted their different experiences, beliefs and values. Most notably, the other Alice had discovered a new form of energy that could be harnessed in extraordinary ways.
