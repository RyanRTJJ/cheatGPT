1. The ending to the film "Apocalypse" left me in awe, the imagery of the moon becoming a ball with the sun and the solar system exploding. It was truly an amazing experience that left me speechless. It may sound cheesy, but its a quote from the movie that sums up the feeling that I had on that planet. You know...like any other planet you've worked on.

2. I'd spent over a year playing in the snow, the frozen water is a constant reminder of their fear of this cold night. I try to tell them that the stars are always brighter the closer you get to the zenith - a reminder to keep a close eye on your energy levels.

3. On my birthday, I went to the grocery store and my aunt gave me an old bottle with black and red dye in it. I used the coloring paper to play with the paint for about an hour. Every single time I used it, it was a different color. I was told it's a therapy for me - a way to bring some positive energy into the world.

4. I love doing my homework, this class is usually easy, but because I'm an only child I often end up doing it when there are only a couple of other children doing it - its a stress reliever for me. The kids say it's so special to have the little kid like me in there though. Its nice seeing another face and hear another voice - and even if its not helping me, at least I got to see how others do things.

5. I loved the book "The Last of Us". It's about a family coming from Africa on their journey to the US. The idea of taking a bullet for your family is not an old idea or a recent one - it's a constant reminder for many.

6. I always use the words "beyond words" when referring to my memories. They hold such power.
