1a) You're about to lose. 2) You're not sure if you're crazy. 3) You've already tried everything. 4) You're thinking like crazy. (Not crazy, not crazy, crazy.)

For the last two options, use a choice between extremes: no answer, and if it comes to one option, either no answer, and if it comes to the other, then neither answer.

The third option is a little tricky because you're thinking it too. The answer is not completely clear at first but you don't want to take the wrong path on this one.

In this case of a yes/no, use your imagination first and then go on to the more logical and objective answer. In this case, I want to use my imagination first and then go on to the objective answer.

As with any "realistic" work, you'll have to practice this one in the mirror. For the real, a good place to practice it is in someone's bedroom.

2a) You're just not sure. 3) You've tried everything. 4) You have an answer. (Not an exact answer, but a good guess.)

For the first two, you're too crazy to think a bit. You've tried everything. And yet, the third part involves a real problem, with some real problems. Therefore, the second thing is to practice using a logical reasoning method, while the first part is not a real life situation.

In the first part, the question is whether you're a crazy person. But the second answer is a real life situation that doesn't involve a certain amount of rationality. The decision has to be made between thinking about your answer and to ignore the fact that it's a hypothetical question.

Once again, a good place to practice this question is in someone's bedroom.

2b) You're too hard on yourself. 3) You're thinking too far in all directions. 4) You're thinking too much about this life. (Not the whole life, but lots of it.)

The second one is a very real "maybe"
