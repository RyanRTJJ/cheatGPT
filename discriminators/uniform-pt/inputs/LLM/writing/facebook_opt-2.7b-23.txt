 Do a sequel or alternate ending.
I second this! I love historical stories, and this one sounds so interesting. You could go all sorts of different directions with it too, could be WWII, could be the Revolutionary War(s), or something else?
Good ideas, I will certainly add them to my list!
Thank you! That would make a great game or a series, wouldn't it? But I doubt it would happen.
The only thing you need for another game to happen is someone with an idea to fund the project! No project is ever dead in the water because no one has enough money to fund it. As long as there was interest in the story it would be able to succeed! I would, but I live in Japan where there is a lot of game developer funding going on, where as I am stuck in the USA for that matter. Oh well.  The only problem is, it's easier to make a series out of this story than an individual game. I could see that though. :)
I was actually thinking about this earlier today and how amazing it would be to make a series; especially since it's not a war-themed game. I think that would also make for a good book. Great idea! Good luck on your future game! =)
Thank you!
Are you planning to make a sequel or what?
I don't think so at the moment, but I am not saying never. I want to try and finish this first and see how it goes. As far as I am concerned though, this story is complete if there were any unfinished things in the end. If there aren't, I may expand on it and put it out on a longer scale. Perhaps. It all depends on if I think I can get more funding. I am already planning what I will do if I can't. Thanks for commenting!
Thanks for replying!  I look forward to reading/playing the game when it comes out. I just wish I weren't in a time crunch so I could read it.
