Haha, that actually took me a couple minutes to make the connection with the prompt. Thanks!
Awesome to read the story. I am wondering what story you'll write about what you'll do to your classmate. I would not want to be your teammate right now. Haha! That is a seriously unbalanced score.   Your best friend, the one you told, probably wouldn't have the same score and would consider it disrespectful. I'd be worried about this guy.
He would definitely be a 7 on the scale.   Yeah, he's a bit of a dickhead. Not too smart if you ask me.
Sounds like I'd avoid playing you in a game of Quake or Unreal too! He could hurt a lot of people!
He could. I definitely wouldn't want to die because of him.
At least it makes you a 9 on a scale of one to ten! Lol.
Haha, I guess so! I wonder if that guy's name is Jeff.
No it would be Jeffery. Just like the little asshole.
Lmao. The scale makes me laugh now but I can't imagine how that would work to the average person's mind.   Maybe the story is going to be the story of a crazy teacher who is obsessed with the scale. I'll keep that in mind!
I look forward to reading the story. If anyone has questions about the scale, message me!
Thanks. I'm making a "Story time" post. You can follow through with the whole thing if you like! That's a pretty good idea though!
Maybe. I'm a little afraid to start it unless the scale is actually going to be used. It would be a little redundant to have a whole story about something people have understood since
