 And then write a letter to the kid writing that story for her/him.
This sounds very cute, though I think I'll stick to the usual prompts for my prompts. (i.e: The Kid asks the Stranger to tell his or her life story.)  :)
This is a very clever idea.  It can be fun to use prompt generators if you can find something appropriate.  Especially if it's a group project.  A group effort is nice because that is often how story lines emerge.
The problem with that is for most kid readers, all they are going to do is pick the obvious prompt and not the one that is going to draw out most. I may do one of those prompts when I'm trying to get kids to come up with original ideas, if I can ever make the time to teach kids to write, but for the most part, I'd say that prompts work much better in the adult writing community.
Yup, I agree. It's an "I don't have an original idea to offer anyway" situation.  It's not a problem to create prompts when you are looking for a project--just write one, then choose a prompt from the generator. I have to make some of my own and they are fun to make up.
You probably read the prompts on the front page of that site (in order to get them) right? Not every story has something that you can do with that prompt.
Yup. Some things are better used with other prompt generators. Not everything is a good match.  But often enough, it's possible. And those things I recommend are usually a good match. I know exactly which ones I want based on if the prompts are good.
I can understand that, but I can't stand "You go there..." prompts because it's like a prompt to a different genre than that person's "go here."  What we find that works best with kids is to ask them to come up with a way to do something on their own, but it usually just ends up in writing down ideas for
