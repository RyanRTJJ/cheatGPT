Heather walked down the street, a spring in her step, her dress billowing in the breeze. Everything about her today seemed different. Even the old dog down the road of her usual route gave her a friendly bark as if he recognized her newfound joy. She thought back to what had changed, and it had all started a few days prior. 

It had been a normal afternoon, until he walked in. He had a distinguished air about him and he offered her an intriguing opportunity: an open position in his company with a substantial salary, and the promise of a promotion within a year. She had accepted without hesitation. 

Two months later and she still felt energized each morning as she headed to work. In these two months, she had become indispensable to the company and had been promoted twice. She was now second-in-command and had a salary that she could hardly believe. 

It had been a steep learning curve, but she couldn't have been more satisfied. It was like a dream come true, and it continued to get better every day. 

As Heather continued down the street, she thanked the heavens for this wondrous opportunity. Of course, she was quick to note that she had her skills and hard work to thank for her fortune as well. But she knew deep down that luck had also woven its way into her success. 

The lie in this story is that Heather was promoted twice in two months. In actuality, it had been a much longer period of hard work and dedication until she had finally been promoted.
