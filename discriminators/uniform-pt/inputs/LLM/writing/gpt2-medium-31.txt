_________________________________________________________________________ Here you can find a variety of stories based on each of the scenarios listed here. The first is the story that has gone down in New Orleans. The second is the story you can't believe, or if you live in Florida, you know is fake. And finally, the story with the big gun is real. The second scenario is based on a photo of one of the weapons used by a police officer during the shooting during Hurricane Katrina. There also are two stories about a famous police officer who died. You can get both of this story as stories on my "People with Guns" page. _________________________________________________________________________ Here is an alternative to this story to see the result of the scenario you selected. The last story is based on the image below, the one of what happened when that policeman was shot dead by a Black man, on August 29th in the early hours. You can actually see the "shooting" on that photo in your browser. It's so good, I have to add every story here for a full story. _________________________________________________________________________ We should probably talk about the FBI's decision to not respond to each other's questions, but I can give them an alternate answer if you want for one point of time.

He admitted that the White House didn't do anything wrong, but denied that that's the administration he was dealing with in politics, telling an audience of law professors, he thought the FBI "is doing great." What do you think? Does the president believe the FBI can act against the White House? Should he just shut the investigation down now? Or is that not who Mueller is dealing with? Tell us in
