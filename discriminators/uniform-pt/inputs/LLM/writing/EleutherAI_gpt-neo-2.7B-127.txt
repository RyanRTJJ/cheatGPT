Day 5: The Morning of the Execution

My name is Fido, I'm a 4 year old Lab, and this is my last day. Today is our daily meeting. At this meeting I receive my food and water, I get in the cage, and we start getting ready for the day.

Now this can be the last time Fido sees my mom. I always get upset when she leaves, so today I'm not upset. This was going to be only my last visit.

I am tired, hungry, and I feel sad about this, but now I get to rest. Fido's last time seeing Mom is my turn to go to the room to the left and have a nice nap. I'll never get to see her again and she'll never see me, but I'll have this at least.

When I wake up it will be morning, and Mom will be gone. I'll miss her, and I'll miss my last day. I'm sad because I know my mom and I have had a great relationship, and she'll always love me. I think I'll start cryin' if I don't find what I was looking for.

This is the way life is. If you have to love someone then you have to let go when your time comes. It's the only way it works, or at least that's what I think.

I'll miss being able to snuggle up to my mom. I'll miss snuggling into bed with her, I'll miss her loving me. I'll miss my mom walking me down the hall, and then when it gets dark, me calling her, "mom" and she being like: "oh, Fido, is it time for you to go to bed?"

I'll miss my dad being able to see us when he comes home from work, and be happy to see him, then walking down the hall to see us, and when he starts talking about what a great life we had then walking over to the bed and me starting to cry
