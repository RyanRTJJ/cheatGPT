John had been eyeing his neighbor's house for weeks. It stood alone and seemed like it had been abandoned for years, but every so often a light would flicker on in the windows. John was desperately in need of money, and he figured that this was his only chance to get out of the financial hole he was in. 

Without much thought, John crept up to the door and broke it down. Inside, it was even more eerie than it appeared from the outside. The house was like a time capsule and was filled with years of dust and cobwebs. He was about to snatch up what he could and get out when he heard a loud rumbling outside. He crept up to the window to see what was going on, and to his shock, it was the Ghost Adventures TV show van. They had come to investigate the house and its haunted reputation.

John knew that he had to get out of there as soon as possible. Luckily, the team was still setting up, which gave him enough time to escape. He ran out of the house and down the street as fast as he could. After a few blocks, he realized that the team was following close behind him, picking up each of his movements. He kept running until he reached the next town where he ducked into a dark alley. 

He hid there until the van drove past, letting out a collective sigh of relief. He had almost made it out without getting caught. It was a close call, and John vowed never to break into another neighbor's house again.
