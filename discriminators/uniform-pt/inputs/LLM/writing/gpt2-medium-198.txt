I've mentioned a few Halloween characters before: goblins, ghouls, vampires, and other spooks. However, there is something special about the spookiest of these characters. Like the other Spooky characters, spooks may come in many shapes and sizes and make a few peculiar appearances at times. Sometimes spooks come in multiple forms, like those above, and are very expressive:
Spooks are often shown in all shades of spooky. They're always afraid of dark, and they are never quiet, which are often difficult for children to understand.
If one of these spooks would seem like one of those weird, strange people that often appear at Halloween parties, but don't actually scare anyone, you are right on the mark. It's a signifier of spooky fright. A more common spooky character might look a bit more mundane, but with spooky elements:
Sometimes when spooks move from one location to another, the color changes.  This can happen if the creature is not spook but still scares enough people to trigger fear memories.
And sometimes the creature is so spooky that it seems like it's never seen outside of these same creepy places:
This phenomenon is also called the "death spiral effect."
