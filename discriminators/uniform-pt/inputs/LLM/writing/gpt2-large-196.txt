If you have written a story that you liked, please send it to steve@robertsonmovies.com.  I would be very happy to read them.  If you have written something else to submit for the contest then that will get it into the drawing.  That part is up to you... it is more fun if you send in something.  Feel free to get creative with your submission.  Whatever you come up with, that is your winning entry.  I will get some great ideas for stories from all the submissions I get.  The prize will be a $200 dollar check and an autographed issue of the movie.  Good luck!
