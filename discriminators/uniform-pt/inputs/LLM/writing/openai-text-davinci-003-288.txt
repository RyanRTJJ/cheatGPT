Once upon a time, in a distant future, the world was divided between the god-like beings and lowly humans.

The gods had the power to manipulate reality, traveling through time and space and granting wishes by their mere will. But despite all of this, the gods found themselves curious about the lives of the humans.

One day, the gods decided to compile all of the words uttered by humans into a single sound; a phrase that embodied the collective thoughts and feelings of humanity itself.

The gods worked day and night to make this phrase a reality. Finally, after careful consideration and many attempts at creation, they produced a single sound - a sonic explosion of emotion and understanding that contained the sum of humanity's collective knowledge. 

It was beautiful, and it resonated across the land and could be heard in every corner of the world. It brought joy, insight, and understanding. It was a moment of great celebration. 

The gods and humans alike rejoiced, as they had managed to come together and create something special. The gods had wanted to gain an understanding of the humans, and in creating this phrase, they had gotten what they sought after.

The phrase remains to this day as a reminder of the potential for even the most divided of creatures to work together and create wonderful and inspiring things.
