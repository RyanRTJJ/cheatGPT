Let's say for the year 1948 that 3,000 people have been born in the Philippines at once and 4,000 are counted each year. To make things even more complicated, each of those 3,000 is only one centimeter in diameter. So, the total size of the Philippines is only one centimeter, so it wouldn't be surprising if it was 10 times larger! For all the people in the Philippines, counting the number one means they have an average size of about a 1,000. It also means the number one person in the country is also 4.5 times the size of the average person in the United States.

But let's also be honest here – these are the kinds of numbers a person will be looking for to find out if the Philippines is a total jackpot. Of course, there will be a handful of people that will likely have a pretty high average size, but there will also be many millions who'll have an average size of anywhere from about 1.6 to 1.8. So if you have a small family and you have a huge group of people to serve, many people will be looking for "the Filipino".

Of course, that's not something you can just ignore. It's going to take a lot of thinking, but one of the basic ideas to get going will be to find those people that are best fit to serve.

That's what being a "good person" is…not just going for a shot at being a hero, but for life.

So what do you do?

Let me get this out of the way first – if you're a great person and you have a big family then you will have to give yourself
