 That, or you could just straight up make one up but that way your story is infinitely better.
I've written several stories on the same premise. Always loved it!

I just have a hard time coming up with a good angle for the story. I may make one up though.
That's an entirely valid point.
But I still want to have a go on your challenge :)
Oh you are. This time I have a slightly more specific prompt, but I wouldn't rule it out that I could send more.

Well, first off good luck with your challenge. I would be remiss if I didn't point out that you've also already failed at it, if I recall correctly.  I mean, I don't know what genre you're writing, but some sort of fantasy seems to be... well what it looks like.  If you want, I could see if I can get you published somewhere... but it would mean I would have to lie to editors.  But if that's not an option and you feel like doing it anyways...
I will do my best! And, that's okay, I have already written the other stories. I do have to admit though that I may have exaggerated a bit about the number of submissions I have received...I guess they weren't bad stories but not that great either! :)  Thank you for the offer though!
I was going to guess that all of your stories were like "you killed his mother and stole his virginity..."  No, I never lie about having stories accepted! So I don't think I would do that to you!  But if you don't
