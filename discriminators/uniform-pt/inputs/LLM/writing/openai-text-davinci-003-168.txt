Paul and Sally were two complete strangers who had become unlikely companions that day. They had met while waiting for the elevator in an office building, each with different and separate agendas.

Paul had just finished a rather unpleasant and contentious meeting upstairs in the corporate offices of his company. Even though the outcome had not even been close to what he had hoped, he still decided to take the elevator back down, to clear his head and regain his composure.

Sally was on the way to a job interview. On her lap lay the portfolio of her work, which she had prepared with such care and dedication to make a good impression. She was quite nervous, but in the elevator everything seemed to melt away.

The doors opened and Paul and Sally stepped in. Paul pressed the ground-floor button and the elevator started its descent. Everything about the journey seemed surreal to them. They exchanged nervous glances, each of them quite taken aback by the other's presence. Time passed, and the elevator continued its descent, with the two strangers in total silence.

Finally, they reached their destination. The elevator doors opened and reality came flooding back into their minds.

"Good luck," Paul said with a smile.

"Thanks," Sally replied, touched by his words.

The two strangers shared a brief moment of understanding before the doors closed and the elevator carried them away in different directions. They both knew that the elevator ride had changed something about their lives, though neither of them could say for sure what it was.
