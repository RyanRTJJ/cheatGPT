It began as a subtle change, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Something was different about my friends and family. One day, I would notice that a close friend had the slightest color difference in their eyes, the next I would find myself wondering who replaced my dad's laugh with a quieter version of itself.

I began to question whether I was imagining things, but every time I tried to confront the subject with my loved ones, they simply shrugged it off.

As time went on, the changes became more drastic. My best friend's hair seemed to become a much darker shade overnight, and my mother's voice became tighter at the same rate.

I didn't understand why they couldn't see it, and I started to become increasingly paranoid. Was something wrong with me? Why couldn't I just enjoy the moment like everyone else? 

Finally, after months of confusion and fear, I stumbled upon the answer in a way I least expected. As I was scrolling through my phone one night, a news article came across my newsfeed with a familiar face.

It was my dad.

The article explained how, with the help of a kind doctor, my dad and a few other family members were undergoing medical treatments to change their physical appearances. 

Suddenly all the confusion from the past months made sense. My family and friends were transforming in an effort to become different than their former selves.

Now all I can do is accept the changes for what they are, and appreciate all the new chapters of their lives. No matter what, I will continue to love them just the same.
