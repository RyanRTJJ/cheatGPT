     How does he use it? What's he hiding in it? Would he give it to someone else if it were not needed in the story?
I feel like it would be very difficult to find content that hasn't already been done, so I don't want to do it. Sorry.
No worries. There are tons of existing prompts people have done. Try the search function. This sub is great at that.  Also, try the prompts over at /r/writingprompts - I've heard a couple of good ones there. Good luck!  [OOR] I also forgot to say in the comments that your prompt would probably work over there as well! ;)
Thank you very much. Sorry if it sounds snooty, but the prompt idea is what I was looking for, and I don't like the idea of trying to rip someone else's story into one that already exists. I'll try the prompts.
It's not snooty at all. I only posted my own in here because I wanted others to read it and be inspired by the writing. No hard feelings on my part if your idea isn't the same one I came up with. I was just trying to help out :)
I understand. If I ever have a story idea that fits with a prompt, I hope that I have the presence of mind to take a picture of that story and use it. Good luck. :)
I did the same thing. It's what sparked it. You have a good idea, just have someone else write it and take the idea with you!
Thank you very much. :) I plan to. I haven't started writing anything other than a blog post, but this is definitely on the list of stories to write down.
I have never written fiction but a lot of my friends are successful writers and I have been watching them for years. It always seems to be the same story each time and people will write to
