 If you had the skill to go that far you just might be surprised. But that doesn't make you any safer. The higher your level, the less likely you will be to find yourself in danger. You are trained to see your threat more clearly and to get it over with quickly. As a result, "Dangerous" people are much less common than they used to be. Because it is so easy to perceive people of differing ability level, many people who have high level skills tend to start to be less dangerous than average.  So, if your ability to measure a "dangerous" person on a scale is 10 - 9, you are almost certainly making trouble because you think that "Dangerous" people are way ahead of you. It might be an example of someone who starts playing with a knife but then gets a knife thrown when they hit hard. Maybe as a child you would be an 8 and get stabbed in the head, and then get stabbed by an "other" person after that. If you are a young teen, one would be that way. And if one of the same kids is killed, then one child will probably never get even an ounce more "Dangerous" than one of the people who were trying to kill them.
