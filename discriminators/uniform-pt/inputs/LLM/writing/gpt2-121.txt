One day we'll learn as much as possible about how the Serenity spell works. ________
The sigil makes sure we never forget that that's what happened to our Lord in the beginning.
From what can be gleaned from the events in the books, "The Serenity Spell" means something the Lord knows, some way or another.
For example: if we're talking about the way the sun and moon form, it's possible that the "signal" of this sigil is that it creates the sign of light, a sign that a certain number of souls can be found in the land of a thousand souls. The number of souls in a nation is never precisely defined, but given the population of that nation, the number of souls is very approximate: so, if you wanted to measure the number of a hundred souls in a nation without knowing any of that specific number, you would need at least one hundred thousand souls. In other words, every soul in the universe is a soul.
So, you know, maybe if we used the number of souls in a country, it would mean that when the sun was shining, there were millions of souls in every nation. The amount, perhaps, of souls in a nation depends on the number of souls that one of those people would bring to the sun and moon. If we used that number for the sigil of Serenity, the number of souls that one of those people would bring would be very, very large -- you know, you wouldn't be able to tell that it was a Serenity spell until it would actually hit you.
Which brings us to the question of how a spell actually impacts our lives.
If you know about "the sun" or the moon, your life depends on
