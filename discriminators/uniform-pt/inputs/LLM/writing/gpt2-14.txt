 If it's not on an old building, find a place to live that's not haunted and make it to the front door!  
Now, where did this first "Haunted" name come about?   It has become an extremely popular term in New York, because it refers to a property that was just constructed prior to the earthquake.  In other words, it means a house that has been closed for tens of years.  And it can be rented to someone for years.  That is exactly what happened to a home in South Florida.  It's called a "JFK Homes" and is located in the midtown (I'm lucky there have not been any reports of any of the people listed to have closed their homes for two reasons; one is because of the financial stress on those paying for their "homebuyer's insurance"), but is actually located in the South Florida area of South Carolina.  It's a real estate scam filled with real estate brokers and others claiming to be the "Coup d'Espoir", and has become the nation's leading place to buy real estate for a "big fee", although they were just beginning to go.  My wife and I have only lived there for a couple of months now (I know a lot of you are also wondering where were the people who actually bought our house for $350,000, if they have been doing that for a while and now realize that they've gone too, which would sound like a lot to them, but I guess it's what happens at the end of a long cold winter day), and she's just told me that her house now is vacant.  And for anyone wondering, that was before the disaster, right? I'm sure these folks who are claiming to be the "Coup d'Espoir" have now had almost 2 years to change their minds, either from their original false claim to being the "JFK Homes", or from their second false claim of wanting to buy "Big Fee", "Coup d'Espoir", and
