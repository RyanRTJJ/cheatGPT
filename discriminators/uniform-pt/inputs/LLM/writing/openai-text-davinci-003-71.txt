Once upon a time, the disparate countries of Europe and the Eurasian landmass were forever separated by the boundaries of those nations. But, in the distant future, it was no longer the case. After centuries of collaboration, conflict and growth, the people of Eurasia and Europe had finally come together to form a single, unified nation: The United States of Eurasia, otherwise known as U.S.E.

U.S.E. was, in all senses of the term, a melting pot, in which individuals of all ethnicities and cultural backgrounds could work alongside each other in peace and harmony. People from vastly different lands learned to coexist, provide mutual aid and support, and collectively help each other reach their goals and make life better for one another.

While this newfound unity provided U.S.E. with stability, strength in numbers, and a booming economy, it had its own challenges as well. It could be difficult for citizens of different nationalities to find common ground and it could be hard for a person to know where they belong when their cultural ties span multiple countries.

Fortunately, U.S.E. had a few people at the helm that found ways to bridge these divides and not let them impede progress. These individuals realized that U.S.E.’s strength lay in its diversity and that embracing this could create a brighter future for everyone.

Through the efforts of these talented individuals, the people of the United States of Eurasia were steadily advancing the cause of human progress and making their nation the envy of the world. No matter what tomorrow may bring, it is certain that the U.S.E.'s people and their commitment to bettering each other’s lives will always remain
