Today was the day I had been waiting for - the day I finally left the mental institution; the only place I'd known for the past twenty years.

It had seemed like an eternity in that place - living in a world of monotony and regulation; one with no hope of escape. I had felt like I was stuck in a prison, in limbo, yet knowing that I could never be truly free.

Even after all this time, all the therapy, all the medication and rehabilitation, I was still scared of the prospect of freedom and the world outside of these walls.

I walked out the front gates, my feet shaking as they dared step outside, into the unknown world before me. Even as I took my first steps away from the institution, I was unsure of what the future had in store, but I was sure that I wouldn't be changing my address again anytime soon.

I am finally free.

As I look back at the institution - a place which was once my entire world - I can't help but feel relieved that the doors have been permanently shut on that chapter of my life.

Although I still feel the fear of the unknown, I now also have the excitement of adventure and the courage to take on the world.

But as I take my final steps away from the institution, I also realize that despite this newfound sense of freedom and control, there's still one thing I have to overcome:

Myself.
