--------------- There you have it. It'll help a lot to understand music-based scenarios when dealing with scenarios like this. But really, it's not hard. Even if you're going to start with musical scenarios, just write two words: Theme. There's nothing new here unless you try a little and then you'll probably think I know it. It's just that after writing it down what do you call the characters, and what do they do in the scenario? Well... Well you don't want to be too sure there has to be, there's no need for it. When it comes to how the characters play their role in the music scene, there's a bit more work when it comes to how the music is interpreted at stage play. As soon as you've got all the pieces of the puzzle out of the way let's do some musical game design. It'll help you get your first taste of the genre and let's get back into our usual series... ---------------

Artistic and Theme Creation

This is a pretty standard theme process where things get a bit more complicated. When creating characters, some may argue that you should stick with the basic idea that most of them are about to run away screaming at the top of their lungs and cry as the music starts to rip their skin off their skin; but as anyone who has written another scenario has noticed, some will simply scream in disgust at this trope and do not care about the music playing. The only person who isn't that afraid of this is writers with some of the most terrible names. Some of these writers have been banned from the game-world by my editor for writing some of their worse written content, including some really bad ideas. When writing scenarios that may have characters get away from the music, that's when the characters must find a better means of escape or at least find a way to leave the location being attacked by the music. I'll make this very clear: As in most themes
