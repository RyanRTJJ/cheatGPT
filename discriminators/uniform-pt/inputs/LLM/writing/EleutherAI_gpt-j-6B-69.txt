 
There are many kinds of people, and not just people in the same town and country - there are also people from different countries. 
Can you meet some of these people? And how would you be different from them if you were one of them? 

A:

My idea:

 Your twin.
 Your clone.
 Your cousin.
 Someone else's cousin.
 Someone you've seen on the street once.
 Someone from another time and place.
 Someone you heard of (from history).
 Someone your parents told you about (from books).
 Someone you've come to rely on.
 Someone you'd like to know better.
 A friend of yours...
 You're you.
 In all these cases, you are the same person, since you are based on the same genetic information. Only you know (are "you") and the circumstances dictate (what "you" are).

You start here, and there will always be more "you", as:

you can keep duplicating "yous" all you want; you're still the same person.

 And "you" will never be complete. There's always more "you"...

 You can keep duplicating "yous" all you want; you'll never be "complete"...
 

A:

What if you are 

 Someone that lives far away (like the opposite of the north).

As opposed to closer,

 Someone that lives near (like the opposite of the west)

This is because...

 People that live near seem more prone to do things. If someone has a friend far away, they will not be inclined to visit that friend so often unless there is a real reason for that.

On the other hand someone far away...

 Can also stay away from you. If the only person that ever visits you is someone that lives far away, you never see or hear about that person unless there is a real reason for that.
