  Who/what will be your first order of business?
I had originally considered the button to be nuclear weapons, but your prompt got me thinking of something different. Instead, I'd start with how I might re-establish diplomacy with North Korea.
How would that begin?  I've always been fascinated by NK/US relations. I suppose my goal would be to find out how the past presidents have felt about this stuff, and then start trying to put it into practice.
That I hadn't thought about, but that would really be something. Would be interested to see how the past presidents reacted.
Well, what do you know? I just got an email from NK claiming that one of our planes was shot down - and they have footage of it shooting down. I'm trying to think of how to respond, but I'm not sure whether I should respond with a statement that it can't happen, or to ask it to stop spreading lies.
That's interesting. Does NK really have a plane, though?
They claimed that their nuclear missiles destroyed a plane, so who knows?
Hmm. I wonder how much truth they give to that.
A lot. They're crazy, and we're even crazier. I have a feeling that that plane never left the Earth.
I hope you're right. If you want to know some really crazy things, you should look up the documentary "The Island." It's from the 80s but it's still pretty interesting.
That's a documentary about another country, not NK specifically.    However, NK does have strange claims on certain things. That's why I was watching it. That and their claim and subsequent video of shooting down an American passenger plane.
