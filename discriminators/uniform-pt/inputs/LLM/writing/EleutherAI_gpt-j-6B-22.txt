I am looking for a really short story I can't really think of one...I like making up stories too. Any ideas or suggestions of what to say would help because it is only a small little detail and it will be a problem for my English classes.

I have read the prompt and am considering writing something. I am currently studying writing and am having a really hard time trying to figure out the subject of my story. A really short story like I said...not long at all. I am struggling to come up with a new story. What should i write about? Is it possible to get better at this or am I meant to just start already?

Write a story based on this prompt: This isn't home, but it'll do. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Please add a sentence to the third paragraph of the 'Note' field of your profile and be sure to include that you read the instructions above.

Good idea, except for the grammar. There should be no apostrophes in this post and I'm not sure about some of the punctuation here. Also, make sure the grammar is in line with the instructions. That whole last paragraph is grammatically incorrect, as is the first and the whole third.
