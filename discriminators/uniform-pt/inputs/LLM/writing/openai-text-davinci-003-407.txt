The teen cowered beneath the rubble, fighting for breath as the sound of fighter planes filled the once buzzing city. Tears stung her eyes as her heart raced. This was the beginning of the end, she thought. All of the battles, the suffering and despair, had brought the city to this brink of complete destruction.

Suddenly, her surroundings shifted. She looked up to see a soldier standing before her, their uniform and face hidden in the thick smog. She could not tell if they were friend, or enemy. Her anxiety rose as a barrage of bombs and bullets descended on the city.

The soldier did not move. They stood still, vigilantly watching, their face expressionless. And then the teen realized: they were standing guard, shielding her from the blast. She watched in wonder as the soldier's tall figure blocked out the barrage. Time stood still as the teen and soldier looked at one another, both of them completely still, as if in a frozen moment.

The onslaught, however, could not be stopped. The bombs were relentless and the city started to crumble around them. The soldier yelled for the teen to run, and with the last of their strength the teen obeyed. As she ran away from the war-torn city, she looked up and saw the soldier standing there, waiting for the bombs to end. 

The teen knew that she had found a friend in this senseless war.
