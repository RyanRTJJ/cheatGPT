 A frozen soup packet.  It was cold.  I had an ice axe.  I was cold.  I had no choice.  I would have to turn this off because my mom was in the kitchen.  For someone who likes to think, well, she should have run this last bit of frozen.  But no.  What a terrible thing to be.   They didn't ask for blood on their hands.  They would give me ice in case I needed it.  They didn't have the money to pay for the pain in my arms.  They hadn't given me ice for my mom's birthday yet.  My hands got burned too.  I tried to take pictures because nobody was here to look after me unless they were on duty.  I tried to make a note to myself: "They are waiting on my hand.  Tell them I am not here.  They will pay for it and give me the money."
