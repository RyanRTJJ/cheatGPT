It had been one long, tiring few months ever since they had announced I was the newly elected President of the United States. Even now, standing in the Oval Office, I could hear the hustle and bustle of the nationâ€™s capital outside my window.

The first few days had been spent talking with the outgoing President about the transition of power and learning the ropes. But one thing I'd noticed then that I hadn't been expecting was a large red button tucked away in a desk drawer. When I asked him about it, he told me that it had been there for decades, that some secret about what it did had gone with Kennedy to the grave.

At first, being President kept me too busy to even think about it. But as time passed, I became increasingly curious. What was the button for? Did it control something important? In the end, my curiosity only continued to grow and I decided to find out what exactly it did.

So, after years of buildup and anticipation, I finally mustered up the courage to press the button. Almost immediately, something strange happened. Every light in the Oval Office suddenly switched off and the lights in the corridor outside started to blink in strange patterns. Music started playing in the background and I finally realised what had happened. 

The button had activated an automated music and light show. It must have been set up some time ago by Kennedy. Even now, I feel a sense of awe and wonder at the show and the secret that had been kept for so many years.
