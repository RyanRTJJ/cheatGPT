 I think this would be:

lust > pride.
poverty > avarice.

as I think they are the most relevant:

 Lust is a sin in the sense that you can lust for someone or something which is not the best, and for that matter, I think it's good that you made one of your sins just 'lust'. Just because it's lust, it's one of your seven in no way indicates there will be any actual sexual relations (though that's just what my 'own lust' implies), the point is its a sin that most people will know exactly what that sin entails, and what it is. 

Poverty is another sin in the sense that you can become too attached to your possessions (your car, computer, tv, even money). We can call those things which we become attached to 'possessions' in much the same way as we can use the word'sin' to mean you're attached to sinful things.

Avarice is another sin in the sense that you cannot resist it no matter what, even in the face of starving to death. I think your 'pride' implies an excess of self-esteem which if you take 'pride' literally, it's very important that the sin isn't literal, though we could take it as a sin if your feeling an excessive level of self-reward from doing something. Avarice could be something like 'the sin of sloth' where a'sin' is your excessive attachment to sleeping and food. 

greed > envy.

 Greed is another sin which would make sense if it were literal, but it's not. It's just another sin, but greed in this case is just envy.

greed > wrath.

 I'm not sure that this is anything more than 'pride' in disguise but I would go with it simply because Wrath is a common way to refer to anger or rage which is a sin. Wrath is the same thing.

greed > sloth
