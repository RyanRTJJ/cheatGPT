The smell of rain was heavy in the air, and Emily couldn't help but find comfort in it's familiarity. She would always remember the years her mother and she spent on their small farm, how she felt safe and content when the rain fell.

Opening the window, she allowed the cool air to fill her bedroom and the sound of the rain to mask the emptiness of the house. It had been two years since her mother had passed away, and Emily still hadn't been able to fill the hole in her heart. 

A tear slid down her face as she leaned against the window, and she closed her eyes, allowing the sound of the rain to lull her. But suddenly, she heard something that didn't belong.

At first she thought it was just the wind, but it was too steady and too strong to be the wind. Emily opened her eyes to see a single figure standing beneath the streetlamp. The figure seemed familiar, and Emily squinted in the darkness. It couldn't be, she thought.

But it was. Her mother, standing beneath the streetlamp, smiling as if nothing had changed. Emily wanted to run to her, wanted to wrap her mother in her arms and never let go. 

But she couldn't move. The moment was too perfect and too painful, and all she could do was look.

Suddenly, her mother blew Emily a kiss, and in that moment, Emily knew that everything was going to be alright.

Turning away from the window, Emily whispered, "It's just the rain." And for the first time in two years, she finally felt peace.
