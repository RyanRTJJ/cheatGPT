  It opens itself up to endless twists and turns.    I suggest finding an example of the kind of story you want to write, and follow the prompts until you get to a story like that - then you can build on that.
My problem is when the prompt calls for 3 different characters, and I think "ok, I could write it from the point of view of the other 2" and then end up with the 3rd character doing nothing, and it's not all that interesting or interesting at all, and then I start thinking "ok, I don't really want to write the 3rd character, it could be boring" and then I end up just throwing out the story.
Well, this is my problem too. I don't really know where to start.
I've thought about writing a "story of" about myself, with the events of being alive and all that.  But I really don't know how to begin it.
One thing that worked for me is to write about a character that isn't really like me at all. I ended up doing it about 40 times, and each one was worse than the last, until I saw the pattern. I'd write my stories then go and read other people's stories, then I'd write my own. Eventually the stories stopped being terrible. My only piece of advice would be to start putting them down and read them again.
Awesome.  I'll start doing this.  Thanks.  I will probably give a little story of mine and write about me trying to save something with my username in it.  It's going to make me feel good, I know.
Make it a novel. It'll help you figure stuff out, plus it can be good for helping you write better stories.
Thanks for the advice, I'll start working on a novel.
Check out how writers write - I'm bad at explaining things, so just try not to get discouraged (unless it's because
