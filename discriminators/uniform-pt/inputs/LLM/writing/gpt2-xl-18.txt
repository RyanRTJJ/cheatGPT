_____________________________________________ How the World Began "One morning I awoke to the sound of the bell. From beyond the threshold of my room, I could hear footsteps down the hall. I peeked out from behind the wardrobe door. I could not have been dreaming -- the figure from beside me was a man. He had black and copper hair and eyes. His face was a little round and his nose slightly crooked. One of his ears was tilted back and he wore a hat with a feather." --from "The Origin of the World" by Arthur C. Clarke The origin of the universe is a mystery that has intrigued people from countless civilizations and civilizations ever since the creation of the first human. For those of us that believe in God, there are those who believe that the universe was created in seven days (thus giving us the idea of seven heavens. However, this might be a different God and another universe. One of the oldest cosmological hypotheses involves a great flood that was caused by a falling comet. However, there are many other possible explanations such as a collision with another planet or being created instantaneously from nothing. In any case, there are no clear-cut answers as to what brought the universe into existence, and some suggest that there's no way back. The Earth is a satellite orbiting around a black hole, and we inhabit a part of space located inside a "holographic" universe. In order to understand these ideas, we will start with the concept of a sphere, and then the concept of the hologram. At the surface of the Earth, there are two forces, gravity and electromagnetics. One of these two forces is responsible for moving the Earth. This force causes all objects towards the center of the sphere, and as the Earth is not exactly circular and perfectly centered, the force of gravity is constantly shifting the Earth around. What we have today are a "rectangular" Earth as it is measured by the Earth's surface and its diameter. We also recognize the "flat Earth" as a model of the Earth in which many of its regions have not been created by
