Moral:

Abandoning my previous rule against describing a person too thoroughly, I will give the following details of the people from the previous prompt:

  * A man with a gun.
  * A group of children holding him hostage. (Don't call the police, please.)
  * A kid with a gun.
  * A woman holding an infant up to the camera with a gun pointed in her face. (She's holding the baby in her arms like she's in the midst of a gun battle. It seems to be working.)
  * A woman with a gun aimed at her own head at a table full of family members who are watching an event she is participating in. (She's talking to her son as if he is going to shoot her.)
  * A man taking a picture and placing it up on the internet.

A story-within-a-story in which I take part would be:

  * A man approaches me to ask me to help him, and so he shoots a police officer in the back. (Not really, but that is one possible outcome. If he shoots my dad it is a likely outcome.)

If I get a phone call one day from someone who is telling me they are shot and the bullet that killed them has been retrieved I say to them "I will see they get medical attention." If I am asked "Who would I see the bullet to?" I feel it my duty to answer "The man with the gun. It's the only way he can have that bullet removed."

If someone tells me they were shooting somebody in a movie theater and are looking for a gun that will take the bullets out of their body, I will say "I am sorry that you did something that you have to apologize for."

Some of the most difficult tasks I have ever performed have been those involving self-defense. After my son was hit by a car, I found that my instinct to defend my son was stronger than my own instinct against the shooter,
