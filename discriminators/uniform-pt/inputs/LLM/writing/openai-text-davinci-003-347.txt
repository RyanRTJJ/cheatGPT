Karen and I had been best friends since kindergarten. We'd shared all of our secretsâ€”or so I thought, until the night a few months ago when she and I were staying up late talking. Suddenly, Karen got a very serious look on her face and told me a secret I'll never forget: she was planning to kill someone.

I couldn't believe what I had heard. She was talking so nonchalantly, like it was something normal she was going to do. I tried to get her to explain what was going on, but she just said it was "none of my business," and that she expected me to keep quiet about it.

I didn't know what to do. I was worried for her, but I was also scared for the person she wanted to kill. I knew she was capable of doing something like this, but I had no idea why she wanted to do it. I wanted so badly to tell someone about it, but I also didn't want to betray her trust.

In the end, I decided that the best course of action was to confront her directly. I asked her why she wanted to kill someone and pleaded with her to rethink her plan. After some convincing, she agreed to drop the idea.

I'm glad that I talked to her in time and that I kept her secret. I'll never forget the shock I felt when she told me her plans, but I'm glad that everything turned out OK.
