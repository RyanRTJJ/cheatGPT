You can use this question as part of a test for your creative writing class. Students may use their answers as inspiration for writing a story about a person who sees someone else's death but continues to live on through the rest of their life with a ghost or zombie body lurking somewhere in their mind or spirit. The teacher may allow them to write about a variety of ghosts and zombies, or tell them to write their story as if it were about one particular ghost or zombie. They can then use their work as a model for a story about a ghost or zombie to a friend or family member.

I think that this man would feel cheated if he saw someone in the bar who wanted but could not afford to drink. Yet when a girl goes to the bar, she makes no attempt to buy a drink for the person seated next to her.  I would have thought the situation more humorous if it were a drunken redneck driving his Harley Davidson on a lonely road without headlights or taillights.

**3.** You are standing at an intersection waiting for a bus when a man runs out into the street. He grabs an innocent bystander and begins walking with them.
