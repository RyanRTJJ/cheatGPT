 And when we die, how will you look back?  We die at our greatest pleasure so let's watch out.  If they're not looking, we're dead. The good news is the story needs to tell us what to do next.  After all, the people we're killing with every time we kill someone we kill is our greatest love. I want to tell a story about a loved one that needs to be told, not based off of the worst one they'd ever had. The good news is that those deaths have a kind of a light source and purpose. It's not that we're being mean to their deaths.  It's that we're doing so to serve them and to remind them that this is one of our greatest strengths, and we believe that if we can keep the characters alive, that this is our last attempt to kill them in order to allow them to live together and live again. We give each other our hearts and we tell each other if we can't. We let each other think. We listen. Together we create these stories. Then we move them on to something brighter, more fulfilling.
One of you can be the next.
And if anyone cares about your success, you are the next winner.  I hope you have a great day, and let's take this one moment from now!
