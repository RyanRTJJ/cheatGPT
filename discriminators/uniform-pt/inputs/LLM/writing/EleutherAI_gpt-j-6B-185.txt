I'm going to go against accepted wisdom here and say...

 Your first and second thoughts aren't your dreams. Your first thought is your subconscious, while the second thought is your conscious mind. If you remember your dream, it wasn't a dream per se: it was one thought, your subconscious, manifesting.

If my guess is right:

 Each time you forget to take your suppressant, your subconscious thought "This was a dream, let's take the suppressant" is suppressed, so that there is no dream that night and you wake up with a clear conscience.

Why?

 Because the conscious mind works very fast. Most dreams are less than ten minutes long so, if you forget to take the suppresant, you won't be able to wake yourself up from a dream that can be detected by the conscious mind. Thus, the only dream of significance is one that you remember consciously - something that's not actually related to the suppressed subconscious. 

A:

 You have dreamt that you have taken your suppressant.

This is why you are forgetting your dreams.

 Because your dream wasn't about your dream, but instead about your forgetful thinking about your dream. 

If this is right

 If you remember your dream, it was about your dream, but if you don't remember your dream, it's because it was about your forgetful thinking about your dream.

Forgot to take my dream suppressant

 Your dreams aren't suppressed by your real thoughts about them, but by your thoughts about forgetting to take suppressants.

Therefore:

 You have dreamt that you have taken your suppressant, and forgotten to take it.

 She might be happy to be dreaming and thus her dreams are happy?

Or, she's so happy that her conscious thoughts are being suppressed

 She hasn't suppressed the conscious thoughts so she
