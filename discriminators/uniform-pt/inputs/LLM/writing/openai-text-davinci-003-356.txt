My eyes flew open and I scrambled for my iPhone, frantically trying to untangle the charging cable from my bedsheets. I couldn’t believe it, but I hadn’t imagined it—I was getting a Facetime call at the ungodly hour of 2am. I swiped the notification to answer the call, my heart racing.

My breath caught as I saw the familiar face of my best friend on the screen, illuminated by the eerie blue light of the mobile phone display. Tears stung my eyes. I hadn’t seen his face in three days—he had died tragically in a car accident. He seemed to be in shock, looking directly at me without saying a word.

At first, I was too afraid to speak—afraid to understand what was happening. But then something clenched inside of me and I found my voice.

“What are you doing here?” I asked, my voice trembling with fear and confusion.

The familiar face on my screen stared at me for a long time, and then spoke.

“I’m sorry I couldn’t say goodbye.”

And then he was gone. I sat there for a few moments, still stunned. Then I slowly put the phone down, not wanting to believe what had just happened. It felt like a dream, but it was real. I had just talked to a dead man.
