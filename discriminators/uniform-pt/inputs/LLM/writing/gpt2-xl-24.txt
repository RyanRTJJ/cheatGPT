 That way, I can decide for myself whether or not being an alcoholic makes me an alcoholic, and if I choose to say anything at all, I can say so at my own pace.
Get a question to the panel.
I used to get people on my mail list asking whether you shouldn't use a specific word when describing someone.   One person, for instance, wrote me: "You should be a little more careful about the use of words such as 'diseased'. This means that you can't use them for describing an individual living with a non-life-threatening disease. It might actually make more sense if you just say 'diseased' like if you're thinking about a medical diagnosis."   For another, I got an inquiry from a woman who wanted me to "please make sure that when you write a story about a couple, you don't write that they love to make love."   So what do you think?  Why or why not?
In a recent piece for this blog, I said some people were starting to use the word "disease" as a slur.  A quick google search confirms this is, in fact, what they do. I also used it for a story where someone was talking about their condition, but it was not related to their identity.  So I just used the words "mental illness" for that person in the story.   (This was a "case study" where the mental health issue is actually an important part of the character's story).  I'm glad I didn't use the word "lupus" in that story, and I don't feel it's okay to use it in a story about a character without a medical diagnosis. I don't feel that using the word "disease" in the way the woman at the end of the story used it is okay, since it implies that the person is "dying" for some kind of disease instead of being on their own journey towards recovery.
There's some language that's fine.   For instance, it
