Once upon a time, there was a little human, who's name is not important, who was going about their life, when suddenly they were visited by God.

God said to the human, "I have come to you with a great gift. I have three doors that each lead to a different, incredible outcome. The first door leads to eternal happiness. The second door leads to infinite knowledge. And then there is the third door, and I have yet to open it."

The human hesitated, as they did not know what might be hidden behind the third door, but before they could express their doubts, God said, "Do not worry, the third door may contain something that is still unknown. It may bring the greatest reward, or the greatest challenge. It is all up to you."

The human, who was now filled with curiosity, bravely decided to open the third door. When the human opened the door, what he saw amazed him. It was a vast field filled with stars, galaxies and planets made of diamonds, sapphires, and rubies. The stars were so bright that it lit up the entire sky.

The human stepped into the vast field and realized that they were in the center of the universe. They felt both small and immensely powerful in the presence of such beauty and grandeur.

The human now understood the power and mystery of the unknown, and knew that one should never be afraid of facing the future, no matter how uncertain it may be.

The human thanked God, and went off in an ecstatic trance, ready to take on whatever the future may hold.
