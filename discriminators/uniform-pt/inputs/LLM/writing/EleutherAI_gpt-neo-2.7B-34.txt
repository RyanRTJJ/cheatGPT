## **WONDERFUL THINGS**

_Write a descriptive quote about something that has been wonderful in your life._

You would not like to think about what it was about you that made people so lucky to experience such positive things.  
But consider the following things:

A. That the people who know you were willing to learn from you  
B. That the way a person looked at things made you feel that you were on the right path  
C. That a person's kindness made you want to follow the path so much you ended up getting hurt  
D. That you took a chance one day to take a walk through a place that no one had taken before  
E. That a person was a little eccentric, but you loved her anyway (especially her sense of humor)  
F. That one of your good deeds led to a great opportunity  
G. That someone in the most painful situation (death) was the most self-aware  
H. That your family had an example to follow—you—and that it inspired you to do better to make it easier for others
