 A good rule of thumb is to write a paragraph and a few paragraphs, then leave a few paragraphs untranslated.  At the very least, when they translate, ask for permission to give anything you write away.  There is a good chance they will give you space. So... what can I write this time?  Well, I need to know what you want, so. Here, have some ideas. 1.   "Fate/Live" - Shirou is sent to a simulation where he fights for the Grail.  In Fate/Zero, Shiro was given a copy of the Saber Class of Saber and Saber's Knightmare Frame, "Aria", for the sole reason of fighting his father.  I'm sure Shirou would do anything to have a copy of his father. 2.  "Fate/Stay Night" - Shirou is trapped in a world where reality doesn't exist.  Well, okay, reality isn't really anything like reality, but the idea is that if you kill someone, they'll come back a few minutes later.  But what if the person coming back isn't the person we killed when we killed them?  What if the person is a demon with the same blood, the same memories, and has the exact same personality?  This is the same concept behind Fate/Stay Night's Grail, but what about Shirou? 3.  "Chuunibyou" (or whatever) - Shirou is forced to deal with all of his schoolmates' psychological problems with them doing terrible things to him.  This one is pretty self-explanatory.  It's a fun idea in the novel, but maybe would be too much of a good idea in a manga.  I wouldn't go around writing about my classmates as if they're characters.  Would you actually want to talk about those things with your friends?  I doubt they would do it for you anyway - they'd think you were crazy. 4.  "Bakemonogatari" -
