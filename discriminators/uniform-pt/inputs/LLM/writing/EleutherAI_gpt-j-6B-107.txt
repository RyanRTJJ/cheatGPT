One of the soldiers in the story: We're outgunned.
Another soldier: Not really.
Third soldier: Not really.
The second soldier then turns to the third soldier and says: We are outnumbered, but our training and teamwork still counts.

What would be an appropriate and engaging way to describe this story?

A:

The soldier in the story says "We have an ace in the hole."  
(Your example is a non-standard definition of "ace in the hole", which in this context means one of the humans has a secret technology.)  
That would answer the prompt, and the conversation in the story.
From Wikipedia:  

An ace in the hole is a metaphor for a hidden advantage or resource, as used in situations where one party has better odds of success than another party may believe or guess.

It is not an especially common or well-known term, but it has existed since at least 1848 in its variant "ace in the hole", which seems to be a direct descendent of the original "ace in the hole" -- the earliest mention I found was in the US Patent Office Records, 1848, U.S. patent #2864, in which the inventor was given the second option for the title of the patent -- and was likely inspired by "ace in the sky", another expression for the same concept. 

  The exact original meaning of "ace in the hole" was unknown, however, until a recent paper came out in 2000 by J. Andrew Hoeflich and David E. Minton  -- "A Brief History of 'Ace in the Hole' in American English".   

  I have found a reference to a variant of this expression, also from the US PTO, in U.S. patent No. 857,172 (1906):  

It is claimed that the combination with a plurality of spacer tubes constituting an annular space, may be so used as to provide for the ejection of the projectile, whether by impact or
