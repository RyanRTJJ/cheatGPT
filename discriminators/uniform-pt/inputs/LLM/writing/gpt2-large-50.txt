~~~~~ I'm writing a "best-case" scenario, to make sure my imagination is clear here, but if you don't see exactly what you want in your scenario, please don't worry. This story is about a dog in a happy, family lifestyle and what happens if a new owner doesn't "fit in." This is not a romance story, nor does it fit in well with "my" personality. The "best-case" scenario I'm envisioning is that your dog is well behaved in his or her household and doesn't make you feel resentful or anxious about anything.

Please make sure that you're comfortable writing fiction in your own voice, and that this isn't written for adults.

All the best,

Irene

SOME REASONS NOT TO USE THIS SOURCE:

If you work and/or live in Australia, and you need to find the word for "family", then you're using a "family" word from an overseas reference. "Family" is an Australian language word that isn't actually a single thing, it's the plural of "familia". It sounds like what you'd call two unrelated people living in the same house.

If you need to spell out a word that you're not sure about and it's a foreign word written down in a foreign language, then you're going to get a spelling error. The Australian Dictionary (published in Australia but not in the US) has some handy links and examples (eg. "familia") which I haven't been able to find in the US version.

If the question isn't clear, don't expect to get the answer from the source.

If a reader has a different preference than you do, then don't be shy about changing the question, but please don't just go home and start creating your own query. It will probably end up being edited by someone else, and then again later on by someone else.

If it's a single sentence with no explanation, it's usually not a good source, even if it is
