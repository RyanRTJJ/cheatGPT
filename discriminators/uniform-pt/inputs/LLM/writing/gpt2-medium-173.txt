If you're going to ask me if puzzle is a puzzle, I am going to have a hard time explaining it, but if you give me an opportunity, I'll give it to you like this: "Let's say it has turned out that your dream version of the moon is now a small black, cube with three smaller dots down it in three concentric circles. That's a cube of the Earth." Then maybe I'll add, "What is this cube with three similar dots going on over here?" If you need my name in the next post, it's your best friend: John Doe. He's never liked you but he is loyal, and he makes fun of you. I'm assuming people think I'm cool just because I go to parties. It's not hard to find me here at People's Room.

A lot more people like me than I think. We're like people who
