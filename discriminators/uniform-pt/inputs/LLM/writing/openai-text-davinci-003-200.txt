Once upon a time, there lived a great and powerful hero. People from miles around knew his name and respected his courage. He had saved numerous towns and cities from destruction and no task had ever been too great for him.

But then one day, the hero received a mission he could not complete. A powerful enemy had taken root in the kingdom and no matter how hard the hero tried, he could not defeat it. After months of struggle, the mighty hero finally accepted defeat and fell to his knees and wept.

At first, people could not understand why the hero was so upset. But then, as the weeks went by, they began to understand. The hero was mourning all the lives he could not save and the destruction he could not prevent. He was feeling the burden of his own powerlessness.

After a while, the people of the kingdom showed the hero their support. They told him how he had brought reason, justice and hope to their world, and although the current situation was dire, it would be solved eventually. The hero eventually gathered his strength and lifted his head again. Realizing that his journey wasn't over yet, he vowed to fight on and never give up until the enemy was vanquished. 

The mighty hero was never able to defeat the enemy, but his heroism and courage remained ever-present in the mind of the people he saved. He became an immortal figure and a symbol of hope in a world of despair.
