____________________________________________________ A. You speak from your heart, not from a written speech that doesn't have a connection to reality (but is still technically a speech).

Your speech: You are the leader of an Alien species about to make first contact with humans, with the offer to mentor us past this stage of our civilisation.

Example: "Let's work together to find a cure for cancer."

In a written speech, you must provide some idea about what you would like to communicate to a particular audience, such as the members of a forum, students at a speech, company employees, etc. You can use an already existing written text, use a website or simply write down a prepared speech.

You must never try to use a prepared text. For example, if you write down a speech based on a blog post on the Internet, you might end up with an inappropriate answer and an argumentative speech.

Even if you've written down the speech beforehand, it's recommended to use a natural flow (in this example: you might ask questions about where to find a cure for cancer) and to deliver it in a natural tone. Even if you talk about a topic that has nothing to do with your speech, you should still focus on making the audience feel comfortable.

If a speech must include the names of all your loved ones who have left the Earth, for example, it can't be considered a speech.

When you start to write a speech, take care that no unnecessary text or irrelevant details must be included. Your speech is not made up of the details on something, nor should the details mention anything that isn't the topic of the conversation.
