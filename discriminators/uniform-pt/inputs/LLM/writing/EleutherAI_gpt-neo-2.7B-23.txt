 It is a world of intrigue and struggle, of treaties signed and broken, of alliances forged and broken, of love blooming and festering, of friends dying and friends renewed.  In the days long before cellphones, this world was almost unimaginably vast, but it existed.

War has already begun.  Here is how you can help.

What is the nature of the conflict between the two sides?  What is the nature of the opposing sides?  Why could they possibly conflict?

If the story you have been writing is primarily focused on the "ending," what is that ending?

A good way to find other questions to ask in the story is to write a list of questions that readers might have.  What kinds of questions do you want to ask in the story?  Can there possibly be a conclusion to the story?

For example:

You could ask: What are the consequences of the war?  What kinds of things have war brought to the world?  How do we feel? How will it affect us?

Or you could ask: If it lasts much longer, how will it affect us?

Or you could ask: The outcome is uncertain right now, but what will happen in the end?

And so on and so on.  But also consider writing short stories only to answer one question about your story--to see if that seems necessary.  How do you have
