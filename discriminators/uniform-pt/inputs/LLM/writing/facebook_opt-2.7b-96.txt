 It's that easy :)
That’s an awesome idea! I’ve never written fiction. I actually wrote an entire story about me being stuck at home with no social life because I got really depressed but it never saved or anything. Do I just publish it or do I get published?
You have to do both. That is the magic of stories.  You can also check out a story writing class online. They can be pretty helpful. It's a great first step to writing fiction.  Also, this prompt is awesome!!
Thanks, your enthusiasm really helped me pick up the writing process. I really appreciate it. You’re awesome!!
I like it! Keep using our prompts, they will come to you!  And also write a story about how your life came to be like the one you posted.  It will be epic!
Alright, I’ll consider it. Thank you so much. Have a great day/night!! Have a spectacular week!!
You too, the world is yours! All you have to do is make it a little more epic :)
So far, my epic story has involved a giant cockroach, an exploding microwave, and some alien cockroaches. And the ending is tragic. I’m very disappointed. Can I do better next time? 😜
I’m sorry. No. This is your story. You will make it epic. It’s in your DNA.  Go, write. Have a blast dude.
Now I just need to find some time to do it. I literally have no idea lol.   Thanks again for the advice man, and thanks for reading, it was good. 👍🏼
All good. If it helps, I could probably come up with a crazy cool ending for you if you just need someone to suggest something ;)
I’ll keep that in mind. I think I just need to have a brainstorm and do it.
All good. Just send me a picture of it and I’ll give my best recommendation.
