 --TJ: As humans, we are given a limited number of lives. But you and I, with our much greater consciousness, can choose to live much longer: we can live for thousands of years. And because we knew more of life in this universe, that makes us a higher level of life. Not a life to do anything but live and explore. The universe has given us our own minds, and our own wills; how we choose to use them is up to us -- and our own conscious decisions!  How do you go about developing your own will to pursue your own goals?  This is a very interesting question: Why were people programmed into this universe to be a bit crazy? If they were programmed to be rational and reasonable -- why is it that people still tend to go insane at certain times and places in their lives? Can you give some reason why this would be?" How do you come up with good plans?  Why do so few ever see the goal through to the end?
