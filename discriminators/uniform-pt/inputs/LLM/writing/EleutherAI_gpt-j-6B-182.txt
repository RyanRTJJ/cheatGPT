________________________________________What if you've traveled the world, only to be left by yourself, to be alone on the streets, or even the Earth? Well, how do you feel? Do you feel alone because you haven't yet discovered a group who loves you and supports you the way you deserve? If you have found true friends, do they know about all of your other problems, failures, and heartaches? Maybe you’ve done so. Maybe they’re still your friends. Maybe they’re not. Do they have any inkling of your life? Of the things you’ve done in your life on this Earth? Perhaps things you’ve done that most people don’t get.

Who are you? And where are you from?

In what way are you different from everyone else?

How are you similar to everyone else?

What’s your biggest fear?

What are you scared of?

What do you care about?

What do you like most about yourself? What do you like least?

What kinds of things make you feel good? Who are the people you enjoy talking to? Do you feel you enjoy talking to everyone? Does everyone listen to what you have to say? Are you open and honest with everyone?

Have you ever been the victim of a crime (for example, robbery, rape, assault, fire)? Have you ever taken revenge on your own? On someone else?

"To explore the world, we had to sacrifice our youth."

"Life is a journey. A series of mistakes and learning experiences. I’ve wasted more time than I could remember in various ways. But have I wasted my youth? Not really. The journey has always been worth it. I haven’t wasted my youth. I’ve only needed to experience the world. I’ve enjoyed those experiences. I’ve made mistakes. I’ve learned. You grow up; you get older. Time passes. Life continues.”
