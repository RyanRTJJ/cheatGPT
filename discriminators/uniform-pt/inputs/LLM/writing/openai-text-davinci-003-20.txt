Once upon a time, deep in the unknown reaches of space, there existed two planets that were almost exact carbon copies of one another, perfectly mirroring each other's physical attributes and environment. 

The planets, known as Terra A and Terra B, resided within the same solar system, and were capable of sustaining life. As far as anyone could tell, they looked no different from each other; they had the same mountain ranges, forests, seas, rivers, and golden yellow sunsets at dusk.

The inhabitants of these planets, who had no knowledge of one another, both believed that their own world was the only one in existence, and that the stars in the night sky were simply other shining points of light within their own universe.

So it was a grand surprise to the people of both Terra A and Terra B when a group of interstellar travelers came across the twin worlds, speaking of numerous other planets thought to exist in far off galaxies. 

Upon realizing that their own planets were part of a larger cosmos, the Terrans couldn't have been happier. Representatives were chosen from each planet in order to establish a lasting peace between them, and soon afterwards, Terra A and Terra B were unified under one banner.

Together, they worked to create the first interplanetary alliance, called the Terran Alliance, which granted the two planets a new found freedom and prosperity that they never could have imagined.

The people of Terra A and Terra B, having once felt so very alone in the universe, now found a newfound connection that strengthened their resolve in conquering the stars.
