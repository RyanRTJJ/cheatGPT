The last soldier of a once great empire sat alone and still in a small room. The window was shuttered, and the world outside was forgotten. The room he occupied was sparse, with a single bed, a desk, and a small chest against the wall containing all his possessions.

But at this moment, he was far from alone. There was a sudden, sharp knock at the door-- two men in uniforms stood out there in the hall. The last soldier could feel the presence of those two men as surely as if they were standing right in front of him. There was no mistaking the purpose of their presence, or their mission.

Slowly, he got to his feet and approached the door. As he reached out to open it, his heart beat faster. He could feel a deep and powerful dread rising within him. He knew what these men had come for: to take him away from this room, from this last bastion of refuge, from his homeland.

He opened the door, and there they stood-- two dark figures cloaked in uniforms, grim looks upon their faces. The last soldier of the once great empire knew that his fate had been sealed. He silently stepped forward, out of the room, and followed the two men. He knew that soon he would no longer be a soldier, but a prisoner, and his life would take a new and uncertain path.
