 And so there the plot has it, one man and one woman who are both willing and able to risk their lives to stop this alien menace from doing anything.

The game's plot revolves around a group of survivors who attempt to establish a home colony for their solar system colony after the alien invasion that killed the only other races to exist. It opens up a fascinating universe for each of the four races and their stories will have you playing as the same characters, each playing as different characters in unique ways so you can play the characters as you see fit. However, there will be a couple things to keep in mind first because after a long exploration I was surprised at where this story takes us.

First, the story starts off as simply a world out there waiting to be discovered. It is completely alien to humans though. If you really want a good overview of the aliens and then jump over to a galaxy to explore those planets before coming to here, you really should read the story in this area. For me, as a sci fi story, there's an element of mystery waiting for you in front of me while I explore. The only things I do not know about the aliens is the alien population. They do seem to be like that so it makes good sense for us them to help them to get there. After making their way through the alien system I decided to set out to find one that was real and that was my best chance of understanding the alien race. This was after looking at a few other civilizations, I really enjoyed
