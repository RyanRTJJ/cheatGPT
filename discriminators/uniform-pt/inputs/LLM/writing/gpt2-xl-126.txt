—J.R.R. Tolkien I am a firm believer in two of the best quotes in the English language: "Read my writing. Your body and soul will be improved (and I mean that metaphorically and literally) by it." And "To those who cannot remember the past, make it to the present!"

—Sherwood Anderson

A few things that make me think that there will be a new comic based on this:

1. I think I've finally come around to the idea of seeing "Superman" as a romantic comedy.

2. While everyone seems to think he's a feminist, he really has been a lot of other things, so he actually didn't have to be a feminist.

3. It is a very difficult film to do well and I doubt we'd want to rush a movie based on one of the world's most famous superheroes at the onset of the new millennium.

4. It'll be fun to see an actual DC superhero make an appearance and the possibility of an Aquaman movie too.

5. We don't want all the best things of all the other big characters, that would be too dull.

6. So far, there haven't been a lot of superheroes that are like superheroes anyway, so we think it's appropriate.

7. Of course, there was some speculation that a new Superman would be based on the Dark Knight, and I think that might be the first movie that might be the first of many.

8. Superman's costume is a very powerful symbol.

We're still deciding on the title, and even though it might be fun to write an epic science fiction trilogy in the DC Comics universe - maybe in the style of "Harry Potter" and "The Lord of the Rings" -
