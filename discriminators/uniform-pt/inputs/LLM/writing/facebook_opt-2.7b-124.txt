  So long as nothing is explicitly sexual in nature, I think this could be really compelling.   You could also write a short story based on this prompt:   You're a young, single woman. You just moved to a city. You're an artist.   How is life treating you?
Thank you for the compliment!   Oh, I also forgot to mention this is a college student living on a budget; I'm not *that* great with short stories. I will see if I can get some people's advice on it.  And for those who are unsure, I would like a male.
I have to go and watch the Super Bowl. Maybe sometime this weekend, we can meet.   Good luck.
That would be great! :) Thanks for the offers
You got this! Just write what you think. Your writing and I know this from experience--it can be hard to get started. Remember, we're your readers, and we want to hear what you have to say.   Good luck!
Thanks! I look forward to hearing everything you have to tell me,   (and you too!)
Just write whatever comes, okay?   It would help if you could come up with an original topic.   You can always write back. If you don't have anything to tell, what would we talk about?   Write! Write! Write! And good luck.
Oh, I've got a ton to say. In fact, I've got so much to say that I'm afraid I may say too much haha. I think writing a few sentences now would give me motivation to start writing. Thank you!
Sure. Just come back and say, "Oh, what would you advice? What would you love to know?"
I will when all is said and done, no doubt haha
