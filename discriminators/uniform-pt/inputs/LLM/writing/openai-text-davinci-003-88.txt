The station was crowded as the evening commute began. Everyone was pushing and jostling for a place on the train.

I pushed my way through the crowd, feeling claustrophobic, when I heard a voice in my head. It was loud, crisp and clear and it said, "Kill them. See them all stopping in their tracks? They heard it too. Kill them before they kill you!"

My heart started to race as I looked around, wondering if anybody else had heard this voice. To my relief, no one seemed to notice anything out of the ordinary. I looked around quickly and it seemed as if the voice had come from nowhere.

Summoning all my courage, I took a deep breath and shook off the feeling of terror. It was probably just my imagination, I told myself, though I knew that wasn't entirely true.

I made my way onto the train, still feeling a little uneasy. What had just happened? I asked myself as the train rattled along. To my relief, my stop came quickly and I made my way out of the station, eager to be somewhere more open.

Was this some sort of spell or did somebody really mean me harm? I wondered as I walked away from the station. And why was I suddenly hearing voices in my head?
