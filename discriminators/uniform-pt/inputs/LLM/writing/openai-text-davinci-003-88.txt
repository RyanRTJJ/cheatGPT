Passengers of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 were filled with confusion and awe when they arrived in Beijing Airport three months late, on a flight they swore had taken its regular route. There were no announcements during the flight and no explanation of where the Captain had taken them; it was as if they had gone through a time warp.

As they disembarked, reporters and other onlookers raced towards them with questions. No one could give any answers, though - it seemed as if the passengers had no more idea than the reporters what had happened.

One passenger, a young woman, said she had been sleeping for much of the journey and so had no idea when or where the plane had gone. Many of the other passengers said the same; the only thing they knew was that their passage had been uneventful and that the flight crew had been friendly and helpful throughout.

The only clue from Flight MH370 was the odd readings from the cockpit which showed that the flight path had deviated from its original destination by thousands of miles. How or why this happened, none of the passengers could tell. 

The Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation was quick to launch an inquiry, but without any clear explanation from the airline or the passengers, it seemed that the cause of the unexpected detour would remain a mystery. This, however, did not stop people from speculating; rumors and speculation were spreading faster than the truth.

The government focused on finding out what had gone wrong, but the passengers were more interested in getting their lives back to normal. After all, the passengers of MH370 had experienced something extraordinary, and they found themselves with a unique and unusual story to tell, one which would be passed down for generations.
