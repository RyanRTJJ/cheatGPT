The world was at a point in which resources were limited and the population threatened to exceed the Earth's carrying capacity. As a result, a revolutionary technology was created to facilitate the reuse of genetic material. 

When someone died, their genetic material was automatically collected and put into a database by a special kind of drone. Then, on the other side of the world, a computer would generate a baby with all the same genetic sequence, but with a completely different life and appearance due to the randomization of different traits.

The implications of this technology were staggering, as it meant that the same person could be born many times over and with different memories, personalities, and physical features. It was a remarkable breakthrough, one that was described as "The Immortalization of Mankind."

There were, of course, some ethical questions surrounding the technology as some people felt that it was a kind of "playing God." But, for the most part, the world was forever changed. No longer did people have to worry that their death could take away a special relative or loved one, as they would always be born somewhere else, in a new life. 

The technology was embraced and it changed the way people understood life, death, and the importance of those who have passed on. It was a powerful reminder that although we can't see them or touch them, those that have gone before us still exist in a new form, ready to be reborn.
