Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom, a young knight was minding his own business when he was abruptly summoned before the King. The King proclaimed that a brave knight was needed to save the kingdom's most prized possession - a fire breathing dragon who had been living peacefully in the kingdom's lands for centuries.

He was further shocked to find out that the dragon had been kidnapped by none other than the kingdom's own Princess! It was unheard of for a Princess to dethrone such a grand creature, but it was true. The King explained that the princess had gone mad and wished to keep the dragon as her own.

The knight set off immediately, determined to complete the mission. After days of riding, he arrived at the castle gates and was welcomed into the Princess's court. He presented his case, begging the Princess to surrender the dragon, but the Princess was unmoved. The knight persisted, pleading with the Princess until eventually she sighed and agreed to surrender the dragon - but on two conditions.

The first was that the knight must swear an oath of fealty to the Princess and the second was that he must agree to serve her for the rest of his days.

The knight steeled himself, forgoing his freedom for the good of the kingdom, made the oath and the Princess handed over the dragon. The knight smiled triumphantly and began the long journey back home with the dragon.

Though the knight had bravely fulfilled his duty, he could not help but feel uneasy. He had witnessed firsthand the power the Princess had over the dragon, and could not shake the feeling that the Princess was not done with him yet.
