Tom had been preparing for this trip his entire life. He had researched the location thoroughly, planned out every detail, and he was more than ready - he had to be. The locals told him of a secret cave, deep within the mountain range, where legend held that a forgotten loot of gold and jewels could be found, but not many dared to venture in so deep for fear of the monsters that were said to lurk in its depths. Tom, however, was an avid explorer, and the challenge was too much for him to resist.

He and his team set out the very next day, armed with torches and the necessary tools to dig and carve their way through the darkness. They hiked for days, and when they reached the cave, it was exactly as the locals had described - deep, dark, and foreboding. Tom and his team forged ahead, and for hours, they searched and worked, but found nothing.

Depressed, they headed back and arrived just before dawn, but where there had once been a dozen men, only three remained. Tom's heart sank as he realized that the others had abandoned the quest and left him behind, but there was nothing to be done. He gathered his supplies and began the long, heavy trek back home.

At first they all came back with nothing, and then they stopped coming back at all. Tom regretted ever setting out on this fools errand, and he knew that he had let down his team, but he refused to let this one stumble destroy his desire for exploration and adventure. He would try again, and this time, he would be ready for whatever fate might be waiting for him in the depths of the mountain.
