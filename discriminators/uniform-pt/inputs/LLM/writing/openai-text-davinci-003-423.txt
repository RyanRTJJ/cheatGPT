I was walking down the street when a strange figure suddenly appeared from out of nowhere in my path. He was dressed in a black hoodie and his face was shadowed by the hood. He pointed a gun to my head and said those mysterious words, "I'm sorry, but we will explain everything at the reset. Hopefully we'll have a fighting chance now that we have you..."

I had no idea what he meant by 'the reset', but I was too scared to ask. I could feel my heart pounding and my entire body trembling as I tried to remain calm and think of a way out of this situation.

But then he pulled the trigger and everything went dark.

I awoke some time later in a strange room. A group of people were surrounding me and they all seemed to know me. They told me that they were a group of rebels and that they were on the run from a powerful government organization. They had been searching for someone with special abilities that could help them overthrow the oppressive regime and they believed that I was the only one who could do it.

I was still in shock from what had happened, but they quickly explained the situation. Apparently, the stranger had been sent by the rebels to capture me. The reset was the plan they'd come up with to give them a last chance at freedom. They had injected me with a serum that allowed me to access my powers and now I had the power to make a difference in this world.
