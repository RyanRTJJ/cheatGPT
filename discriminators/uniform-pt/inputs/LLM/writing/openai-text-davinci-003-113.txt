Mrs. Esther G. Waters, aged 78, of Spokane, WA, had been living a simple yet meaningful life surrounded by her friends and family. She had retired some years ago and spent her days gardening, baking, remembering old stories and loving those who still surrounded her life.

Esther was a large and heavy woman, carrying many years of wisdom with her at all times. She had been a faithful and devoted follower of Christianity since her marriage to her now late husband and loved to preach homely messages of truth and heartfelt kindness to everyone she encountered. 

The people of the community loved her, and she made it her mission to help everyone she could, often inviting those in need over for a meal or providing small services for free. She was the plaster that held the neighbourhood together, and no one could ever remember a time when Esther wouldnâ€™t be around to set things straight.

However, Fate had other plans one fateful day when Esther suffered a stroke and was rushed to the hospital. With heavy hearts, the community watched helplessly as Esther was taken away and sadly, no one had the opportunity to say goodbye.

Still, her legacy continues to live on in the hearts of those she left behind, with the community always remembering Mrs. Esther G. Waters as the third highest number-one killer of Americans annually- it is said, she died of a broken heart.
