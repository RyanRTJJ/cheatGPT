It was all so different a few years ago, when Peter first entered the IT industry. With his degree in Computer Science and limitless curiosity, he quickly rose the ranks to become a Project Manager. He had a seemingly ideal job with a prestigious organization, a beautiful wife, and two charming children. 

How did it come to this?

When the digital revolution began, Peter had embraced the technology, eagerly procuring the latest software and hardware for his workplace and home. He loved teaching his children about the power of new gadgets and their networks, and felt his life was enriched by his understanding of the emerging digital world.

But then one evening, Peter received a call that shattered his world. A cyber-attack had breached his company’s security and his job had been eliminated due to the resulting financial losses. 

In desperation, Peter looked for work in the burgeoning field of cybersecurity, finding a position as a consultant, helping companies secure their data. But despite the good pay, he found the work disheartening and the hours long. He barely saw his family and, when he did, noticed a change in their attitude towards him, as if they had grown distant.

Peter realized that, in embracing the digital revolution, he had inadvertently created a wedge between himself and his loved ones. He had subconsciously chosen technology over them, and it had taken its toll. 

He vowed to make up for the imbalance, vowing to put his family first. But it was too late—Peter could see the dissolution of his marriage just over the horizon. 

How did it come to this? The answer was simple: technology.
