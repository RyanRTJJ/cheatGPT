Once upon a time, there was a young scientist who was always tinkering in his lab. His specialty was science experiments and inventing all sorts of gadgets. One day, while tinkering in his lab, he happened upon a dusty old box. He opened it, and to his surprise and excitement, he found a time machine inside.

He was thrilled - a time machine was a scientist’s greatest dream come true! But then he saw the catch - printed on the side of the machine was a phrase that read "time travel only one way." He quickly realized that with this machine, he could only travel into the future and not into the past.

He was initially disappointed, but he soon realized that the possibilities were still limitless. He could visit the future and see what new technology had been invented, the discoveries that had been made, and the solutions to many of the world’s problems.

He spent countless hours traveling into the future, and marveled at the things he found. Eventually, he became so well-known for his time machine that cities all over the world reached out asking him to help them solve their own issues. He even wrote a book about his travels.

And though he only had a one-way time machine, he was still able to make incredible contributions to the world. He showed people that the future held many possibilities, and that even the most daunting obstacles could be overcome with creativity and determination.
