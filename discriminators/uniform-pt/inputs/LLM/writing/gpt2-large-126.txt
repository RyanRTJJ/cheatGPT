 Here's your chance of changing that.  Write a story where the hero must take care of problems that are not his own responsibility and solve them while simultaneously saving the world.  See you at the next hero school. Have an idea for an in-universe event you'd like to see me talk about?  Let me know. Please let me know  if my submissions are too long.  I use the "unfamiliar" option instead of the standard "too long" so any story can be the same length as your submission.  This lets me pick the most interesting story.

I had a great response to my first story, "I Feel You."  It's the next entry on my "Things to Read" series, and I hope you enjoy it!  This was a great story to make my list, and I'm glad I went through my "things to read" to find this one.
I also want to note that I'm reading (and liking) your story (the first in a series.) And I'm hoping, when this one goes up on the "Things to Read" page, that you could do something for me where I could ask your author for suggestions on how to make the story better...
Thanks again!

Hi Carolyn.
My friend, Amanda, recently had a lovely birthday party for her older niece, Julia. I invited the kids all over the world for one big party for Julia for all the people that Julia would be attending.  It is absolutely lovely.  I'm happy they're a big part of Amanda's niece, and love all of her family over the ages.
When I look at my niece's room, I see a collection of cute little gifts: books, candy, a beautiful painting, a doll, a bracelet for Julia. But most interesting, and most wonderful of all, is the baby blanket that's been stuffed with everything from baby magazines to stuffed animals and more goodies.
What a brilliant
