"If someone is shooting at you, your response is no. A well-placed bullet through your brain will end your life quickly and with less pain."

The girl in the corner lifted her eyes and looked up at the large man above her. The man, holding a pistol in his right had the barrel aimed at her forehead.

”Are you a hostage?” The man asked, looking for the most suitable response, trying not make it too easy for someone to free the boy.

”No,” The boy stammered

”The answer is no you are not a hostage.” He said

”I would never put myself in such a situation. I am sorry I lie.” The boy added.

”You’ll never know why I’ve called you down here.” The man said

”Are you really?”

”Look there was a time you would have asked me a thousand questions to see if I was telling the truth.” He replied

”You were shot at and have a bullet in your shoulder, you can’t carry out an action so I have to choose. Don’t make it too hard to choose,”

With that, the man reached for his phone and quickly tapped the number nine. The boy moved away from the gunman as fast as he could and then looked back up at the man.

”What are you going to do?” The young boy asked.

”9″

“1″ came the reply

”9″ The boy shouted again

”Can you hear me?”

The man in the corner responded to the boy by waving his pistol at the kid that was pointing towards him.
”What did you hear?”

”You said 9″
