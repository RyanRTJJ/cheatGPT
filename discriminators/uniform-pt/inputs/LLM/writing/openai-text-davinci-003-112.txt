John had always been a bit of an oddball in his small town. People didn't understand why he seemed to stay isolated, preferring to spend his time alone in his home. Most of his fellow townsfolk viewed him as strange, but benignly so.

One day, John decided he wanted to become a serial killer. He figured it would be the ultimate expression of his inner angst, and the perfect way to make the people around him take notice.

To his dismay, trying to kill someone proved to be much harder than he thought. Everything he tried failed utterly. He simply couldn't bring himself to hurt someone. Instead, he found that he was actually improving the lives of all of his intended victims!

He became so frustrated that he stopped trying altogether. To this day, John is still the worst serial killer in existence... because every time he tried to kill someone, he actually improved their life.
