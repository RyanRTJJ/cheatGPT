Once upon a time, there was a girl named Kendra who believed in the power of luck. She had a trinket that she kept hidden in her pocket, which she would touch for good luck each and every day. It was a small smooth pebble that Kendra had found on the beach during one of the happiest days of her life.

It had been during a vacation with her family to the beach, four years ago. She remembered it precisely - the day was bright and sunny, the waves serenading in the background and the laughter of her loved ones ringing in the air. As Kendra walked along the shoreline, she had spotted a small stone glistening peacefully in the sand. She had bent to pick it up, a little more smooth and smooth-edged than the rest; feeling like a beautiful blessing from the sea.

Kendra had made it souvenir of that day, refusing to part with it since then. She had stitched it into a piece of cloth and kept it tucked in her pocket, not wanting to lose it. She believed that, each time she touched it, it reminded her of the kindness, beauty and love that surrounded her life and inspired her to be present and enjoy each moment for what it was. The pebble gave her hope, strength and courage by reminding her that smiles and happiness will always find their place with her family and friends.

Kendra was sure that the luck of that small, special trinket was enough to carry her through tough times and challenging days. As long as she would keep it safe, it would ensure a lifetime of good luck.
