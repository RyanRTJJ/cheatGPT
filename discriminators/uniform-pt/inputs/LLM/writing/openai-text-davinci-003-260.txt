It was a bizarre sight to see someone walking around in the middle of summer who was wearing a coat and a scarf. He usually wore a winter hat, too, but it must have been too hot for that today. People would often stare at him, but no one ever stopped to ask him why.

The truth was that the man had never, not once in his life, felt warmth or comfort. He had always been born with a chill inside, and it was something that he had gotten used to. He was never warm in his entire life. Not once.

He must have been a fool to think that this summer would be different. Even the hot sunshine seemed to just pass through him without having any impact. He was a walking ice cube, and he knew it.

Most days he would just ignore people's stares and keep to himself. But sometimes, when no one was looking, he would take off his coat and scarf and stand in the sun for a few moments. Just to feel what it was like. To have a moment of warmth and comfort, however brief it may be.

But it never lasted and eventually he would have to put his protective coverings back on and carry on with his life. He might have felt comfort for a moment, but it was never enough. He was never warm in his entire life. Not once.
