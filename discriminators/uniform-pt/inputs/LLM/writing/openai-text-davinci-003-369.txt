It was a quiet Sunday night in the ER- no screaming patients and the halls bathed in a soft light. As the doctor quietly stitched up a scraped knee, the patient aside him, a stranger, watched in wide-eyed wonder.

This stranger's name was Abigail. She had wandered into the ER on a whim, looking for something to distract her from her troubles. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, until the minute she saw the doctor.

The doctor had a kind face, but his hands told a different story. Abigail watched as they moved slowly and precisely, his every move thought-out and gentle. It was mesmerizing.

As the doctor finished with his patient, he turned and asked Abigail if she was alright. She mustered a faint smile and nodded.

The two started talking and, gradually, Abigail felt more and more comfortable sharing her worries. The doctor listened intently, his gaze never wavering and his voice never judgmental.

By the time the ER was starting to wake up, the two had become fast friends. Abigail felt like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders, and her smile was brighter than ever as she waved goodbye to the doctor.

As she walked away from the ER, Abigail thought to herself that even in the quietest of places, life can still find us.
