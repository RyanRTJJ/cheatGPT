## Chapter 4

The night was bright, the stars bright and all was quiet. A gentle breeze came gently rustling through the trees of the woods behind your house. A deer trotted into the clearing, and another deer ambled over to his place. Another deer ambled away to explore the world outside.

It was a beautiful night. With a peaceful sunset. A peaceful day.

And as you sat at the small dining table reading a book, a letter came in the mail.

Dear "Joe" (or would it be "John" or "Jane"?);

You don't know who this letter is from, but you must know who it is to: "Mary".

That little girl doesn't know what she did. She's so confused now. She has no idea what happened. She says she heard a noise, and then she turned to see a wild horse flying past her at high speed, heading straight for the woods. The letter goes on to say that Mary was thrown against a tree when the horse crashed through the branches.

The letter goes on to say that the horse ran off, and Mary is now safe in the house, back in your bed. The letter says: "I am sorry that I called you. Please don't be mad at me. I thought you might like to know I'm just fine".

The letter ends with a little "Love, Mary".

So why would anyone put such a letter through so many different hands?

I wonder.
