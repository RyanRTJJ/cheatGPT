Jefferson lived his life like any other 18-year-old, never thinking much about the future. He hadn't given a single thought about the rest of his life when he was asked to pick an unlikely life event. The one he chose would determine the course of his life from there on out. Everyone around him was picking huge events: getting married, winning the lottery, becoming famous. But Jefferson chose something much smaller, something that he thought he could really achieve within his lifetime: He chose to become an astronaut.

Every time Jefferson died, whether that was at 18, 28 or any other age, he was reborn at the age of 18 with the same task to complete. He would go right back to working towards his aspiration, no matter how much the world changed around him. Each time he died, he was given the same opportunity to achieve his goal.

One time, he died much later in life, after he had achieved his goal and made his dream come true. He was finally an astronaut, and he was admired by many. It was a bittersweet life. But dying that time, he knew it was for the last time. He finally realized he had been in a kind of a loop, when he first set out at the age of 18, he knew exactly what goal he wanted to achieve and he was determined to see it through.

And now here he was, a fulfilled and happy man. Finally, the cycle was broken, he never had to be reborn again. His life event had come to pass and death was permanent. The years living the same life over again were so worth it for this moment of satisfaction. This was a life that Jefferson could be proud of.
