The streetlights had begun to flicker as the evening sky faded to black. As the evening had begun giving way to night, the city had grown quieter. Darkness had started to fill the streets, and only the occasional sound of a car passing by or the chatter of locals walking along the street could be heard. 

Suddenly, out of the quiet settled a figure on the lone park bench. With a deep sigh, the person settled in, adjusting their backpack and pulling their coat closer around their body. The night seemed to swallow them whole as they drifted off into a deep, dreamless sleep.

As the hours passed, the darkness only grew thicker around the figure on the bench. It seemed to wrap them in its grasp, as if to cradle them in a welcoming embrace. The chilly night air made them tuck their hands deeper into their pockets, only to eventually give way to warmth.

The ticking of the clock was their only companion as the figure sat on the park bench. No one passed by; not a soul. No one seemed to notice the figure in the night. To them, they were invisible. 

The hours seemed to draw on, yet eventually the figure grew sleepy once more and soon enough, they drifted off into a deep sleep, finagling themselves in the warmth of the night, wondering what the new day may bring.
