 I'm looking for submissions of one or two chapters, max.  For example, you can write about how one character dies.  It's cool for authors to go in and take your ideas and rewrite them a little, but in this one we need to get the parts together.  Please do not write fanfic or similar genre.  This is fiction.  Please include a link in your submission, and if you are accepting via a website contact me there as well.  No emails please.  I do read them, but you might get deleted, so if you want this to be a surprise please remember to give me one week notice if you are sending to another blog or message board in the process.  This makes it easier for me to contact you.  And if you are sending a story to another site, please mention that you are writing for this blog, because that would help me know how to message you and keep track of your submission.    If you are writing an original work please link to your site's site.    We are not interested in posting stories that are not your own, and we are certainly not interested in stories we haven't read or stories sent in that are more than a few months old.  We are looking for first time works and first time chapters.  Please do not send story ideas in, because we will just discard them and look for fresh ones!  I will get very annoyed if I get emails asking me what to call the hero or one of these things.  They don't belong here!  You can write ideas on things you've thought about, but they are just not as interesting if done more than once and/or in different places.  No more than 10 ideas will be considered, no matter how amazing they are.  The best way to become the next great indie author is
