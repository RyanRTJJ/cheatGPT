There is a way to make a character completely invisible without actually making him invisible. The characters from some movies have to have this effect and this can even be hard to pull off.


But there is one guy and he is able to do it, but it is a little creepy.


Take the two biggest characters in the movie (well bigger than a real human). The biggest one is James Bond, he is six foot four inches, he weighs almost as much as the most expensive car in the world, he is built like the strongest human being ever (or if you are american, the strongest men, and the strong women), he used to be the secret agent of the world's most powerful superpower, until the guy they put him with was assassinated.


When the movie starts, he is on the cruise ship with several other people including one guy known by the real name of Daniel Craig.


Bond has already infiltrated and taken control of the cruise ship. When this scene starts, his character has already killed the guy on what is obviously another cruise ship.


When the Bond team arrive on that boat. Bond has already been placed in the captain's chair and is about to take a command. James is sitting there, in some sort of chair, in the captain's chair.
