 Tell a unique twist on the story, or you can choose one and use it in an existing story, although you may not use any of your characters names, except perhaps to describe them. The idea is to be able to use anything within the world and have it exist in your story to a degree. How far, in the world, has this gone?  In reality it's possible to have a totally separate plane entirely, or an entirely new world, but this is a good way to establish a world that is "distant" and not a part of our own world. This can be either a new Earth, that is completely alien, a post-human world, or a hybrid of earth and post-humans.  Each of these can be described using the world rules. 
Step 3: Write down notes on what you want to include. Make notes about any additional options to add, or create extra details that you like for the character.  The notes should make it clear where this is taking place in the story.  If you want to change their appearance you could say so, but not make it a big part of your story...yet.  The idea here is to get the character to feel as much like our world as possible, and not make it impossible.  For example, a character who lives on a desert planet might find themselves able to travel on a hovercraft.  They cannot speak or write, but their appearance is very similar.  But, on a desert planet, such as Arrakis, where they must walk very slowly, they can do so. This is where it gets weird, though. There are very few deserts that you could visit because they are uninhabitable for humans.  But, there is one that you and your character can visit; that is a
