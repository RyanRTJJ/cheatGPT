 If you are an AI who has access to resources, you may want to explore whether that AI should create new replicates. 1 : (This prompts for another one.) Do you want to do this: I'm sorry, I'm not going to do this.  I don't know how.  If the AI asks for me to do it, I'm not going to do it. Do you know if there is some sort of "wish" or something that an AI wants?  If so, explain what you believe an AI wishes about the AI. [Optional] 1 : Do so. Did you like your last option? 3 : This is the correct answer. You do not care about this answer at all. When the AI asks you for advice, what should you say?  What are your beliefs? 1 : Please tell the AI I do not know everything and that I can only give information that I've been given. I have not fully processed everything that has been provided so far, but I think I'm okay with it. 3 : Tell them that one of these things that you feel you can't say without making too much of a fuss is not true. [Optional] 1 : Aye. Thank you very much.
You've chosen to answer The Human Machine's questions.  You may want to consider an extension of the "Be the AI's Friend" dialogue for your next project.
As with any conversation, you may want to consider using "Be the AI's Friend" as a way of opening up the possibility of a second and even more interesting dialogue if this prompt is not currently being asked at the bottom.
That's it, I'm sure you have at least some of the language you need to create a conversation.  However, I want that next prompt to be an interesting one, so I'm going to want to explore the two types of dialogues that can be built into conversations, as well as explore what AI interaction can entail.  If you find the answer and want to try it out, leave a comment below,
