______________ The main subject, the main person (that often is not obvious), and the protagonist each has a set of qualities. The protagonist's trait is the emotional state of his or her heart and the hero's trait is the spiritual aspect of their being. ______________ __________________________________________________________ (6)              Do not be drawn into a cycle where an author will want to get the reader back into the story. An author will want us to continue and create fresh chapters as opposed to continually creating new stories. The goal of these chapters is to maintain that continuity that is vital to the story. The story will suffer if we continue to repeat this process and repeat the story, not only through word count but also through the dialogue within each chapter with characters and with each other. The writer will want us to feel all the excitement and action in the story, while holding the reader in suspense, so that the reader can begin to make decisions about how they are going to respond to the events while they are being predicted. (7)              If possible make each chapter unique. As far as style goes, do the characters feel like they feel in the character's body? That they have the potential to affect someone around them? How much will the character reveal in that way? If one character is just a stranger, then that character will be more interesting to read about. If all the characters in these chapters were real people you would have some real conversation and action to read about. (8)               Do not try to fill up a writer's diary. Write a diary to show people how important your story is to them. __________________________________________________________ Written by Michael P. Wright, PhD
