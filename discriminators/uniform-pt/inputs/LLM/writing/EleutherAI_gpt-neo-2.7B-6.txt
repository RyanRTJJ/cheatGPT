  You have to get this habit under your control, or it will kill you. Your parents' actions have caused you to lose a year from your life. There is no right or wrong answer to this prompt. Your parents (and you) are in complete control of what is going to happen in the story. Just write something along these lines: (Note this character has a significant amount of control over what happens, and has some time travel, since only a year has been lost. Also, since there is only one character in this whole process, not all the other characters are in control of time like in your situation.)    You have the ability to run as fast as you can to the end of the block, or the end of the block in one direction or the other, but don't worry about it. The only thing that is really going to matter in this story is that you run to the goal! And when you get there, and your parent is there to greet you, you get to tell them the story of your year of lost time.   (Note: if you are using this prompt for fun, you don't really have to tell the story.)

Now you need to make all the information fit together as if it were coming from just that one year old. And write it to convince yourself that you should believe your parents. Then start to fill in yourself.
