The sky was a deep, healing blue that evening as I watched the sun setting behind the fields. The rolling hills thick with green grass laid out before my eyes like a dream from long ago, one filled with hope, optimism, and the promise of life and love.

The breeze fluttered through the trees, rustling their delicate branches and filling my nose with the smell of fresh summer grass. It was almost like a gentle reminder of the good things in life, a subtle respite from my daily struggles.

The horizon shifted with the movement of the clouds, every nook and cranny revealed in the soft, pink hues of the sky. As I stood there and watched, I felt my heart soften, its heavy load of sorrow lightening ever so slightly.

I thought of what life had been like before the days of violence and insecurity. Laughing children running through the fields, their faces alight with childish joy. Parents and families gathering together in the warmth of home and community.

As I continued to take in the landscape, I noticed a flock of birds flying in a perfect V formation, gracefully soaring above and away from the troubles in the world. I closed my eyes and imagined the feeling of being one with them, of leaving behind all the sorrow and heartache that had become part of my life.

And even though the person I loved was no longer here with me, I still felt connected to them. I caught a glimpse of their spirit in the beauty of the landscape. I could feel them in the wind and I was comforted, knowing that their essence still graced the horizon.
