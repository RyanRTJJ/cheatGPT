Bonus: Let's have a random person on the internet ask for someone from Google/Yahoo/MSN to help them with a problem.

Send to google@yahoo.com (replace "yahoo.com" with an actual domain name such as google3.com)


Bonus: Write a story based on this prompt: If it's snowing outside, Google returns a message letting you know you can buy tickets on the subway. (I'm thinking of a Google Adwords promotion, though.)???????


Bonus: Give someone a link to a website that uses Google search to find things. Make them type the URL into google to find the information. The idea being that if they type the URL into a computer that's using Google, that it will return the kind of information they need. It could be a website page with a quote, for example, a website with information on how to buy a ticket online if you happen to think you'll be needing it at the box office.


Bonus: Give someone the URL of an article that will be a link to a website. Make it a simple link to a page on their web. The idea being that the URL of the webpage will tell people to go there, and the "google.com" in front of it will let them know they can do this with any browser.


Bonus: Have a friend who is interested in how to sell anything, have them take a survey to see if they have the right kind of experience about how to sell things, then have them do the deal. (Hint: ask the person about how they were introduced to the item, that is so that you can verify what they've actually said about the item. It sounds weird but it works.)


Bonus: If you are interested in making a website to sell anything, make another website with some of your personal info. (If someone who has your info is interested in selling something, then you are a good customer, and you'll get people to link back to the website you are making.)
