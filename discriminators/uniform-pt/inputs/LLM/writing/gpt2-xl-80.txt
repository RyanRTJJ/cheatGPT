Welcome to the world of

The Perfect Drug for a Crime Novel.

The Perfect Crime is a crime novel series by David A. Wilson that starts in 1991 and ends in 2012. Each book builds and builds. The suspense is amazing from story to story and the characters are just as intriguing as the plot. Wilson has written the perfect crime novel. There is almost never a mystery to hide in there, but there is always an interesting protagonist along for the ride, and when we learn about what happened it is one of several twists and reveals. Wilson's skill at writing a compelling crime novel is unrivaled. "If you want to enjoy a crime novel by David A. Wilson, don't expect to learn all of what happens, or to feel you've solved it. You won't. There is almost always an epilogue full of fun facts, tidbits you didn't know before and information you may've forgotten, which will make you feel like the detective. I hope that will be enough to put the detective out of business. If Wilson isn't your style, you have to start somewhere else." - The Atlantic

"This is an incredible series and a great read. Each book in the series was just so good. If you can get your hands on one of Wilson's books, then buy it and finish it. Just buy me a drink and I'll wait patiently." - The Huffington Post

"This books is absolutely unbelievable. The mystery of the series is so thrilling." - The Daily Mail
