There is no indication of what the alien is thinking. (We probably get a hint when it speaks, if it speak, and it does not come across as a man who has forgotten what language the ship is in.  
Is "A flying saucer containing advanced technology" acceptable for a non-native author to write dialogue for its alien?  
There are more examples if you want to get creative. (Note, if you don't mind, I am open to suggestions.)  

A:

I like the way the alien's dialogue sounds like that of the people on Earth. And, while I think it could be a bit "generic," I guess the alien could answer:

Earth is discovered by one of your neighbors, a peaceful coalition of
  civilizations?
No.  It is discovered by two peaceful civilizations, Earth is the
  second.  You are the first.

This way, the reader is given the context of why "unfortunate" was chosen. 
Another way of using an alien's alien language from alien perspective would be to have it say something like "Your planet is found by the aliens who came from the stars in a UFO." 
This alien sounds much closer to the reality of what the human would say after getting his mind blown, instead of making something from an alien's perspective that the aliens did not believe.

 And, with all this talk about aliens, I think a better idea of a human would be to write the entire thing and then have the alien answer in their alien language the humans' answers. That way, they learn more about their new home and better
