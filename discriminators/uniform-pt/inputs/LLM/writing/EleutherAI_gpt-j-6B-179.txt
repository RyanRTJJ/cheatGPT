It's important that we understand that this will be

our last chance at this if we are successful
the people who are doing the selecting won't change their mind if we fail.
If we fail they will start looking for a new domesticated animal.

We have a few ideas on what to do to win.

A:

This is what we did
Our idea was to go back to our roots, not only as domesticated animals but as mammals as well.
Our first idea was to take an existing mammal and see if it was a good fit for domestication with no other animals being used in the selection process...
We chose 

Rabbits

Reasoning being we already had a domesticated rabbit.

It's already an existing animal with a lot of experience around
They are small (relatively)
They produce milk    
No other herbivores to worry about competition for food
No threat of extinction if we succeed or failure, there are plenty more in the woods and around the houses

We needed to decide on a diet for the animal too

Rabbits can be fed with any sort of food, a lot of people would put out dog food but that's a bad idea, at the time of the domestication ruminants and herbivores were used which would have worked better if rabbits can't be used because of their different digestive systems.
We went on to talk to a few other experts, they said a lot of things that we disregarded the most important being:

No humans are going to start killing a bunch of small mammals and trying to use them as food
There are too many smaller animals than cattle around to feed them to make it worth their time

On the other side a bunch of other people made their points but in the end we left those behind and went with our first idea.

We decided against chickens, geese, and pigs because they already have a large enough market and not enough people would use them for food.
Cats were out because their instincts are similar to humans making them
