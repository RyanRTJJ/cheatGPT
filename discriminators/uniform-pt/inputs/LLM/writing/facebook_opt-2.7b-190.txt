 I'm doing this.
How was he immort?
I got the idea from some other people. It's mostly fictional though.
The Immortal Man by Kurt Vonnegut
Also written by Kurt Vonnegut.
But not immortal!
Well no. He could be a vampire and still a human.
Well no, being a vampire just causes you to age normally like everyone else... unless you drank blood from a murdered baby or something.
I think that's still immortal.  You might have to spend like 1000 years to see your parents. Then you could be immortal as long as you were one and your vampire body lasted.
That's not really immortality though.
Immorality also isn't immortality so what are you getting at? Unless I'm misunderstanding the question.
Immortality would be living well into your thousands. Not being born before your ancestors.
Immortality is just not dying. You're body will continue aging and your genes will live on in offspring. You will live as long as your body continues to function.  If I die but I'm still alive and don't spend the rest of my life in a vegetative state I'm not immortal, my life is simply not over.
That's not immortality though. To be immortal you have to die.  Immortality is actually defined as having your soul or consciousness preserved after death.
It isn't defined that way. Do you think I'm going to start defining immortality as having a good personality?
No but that's what it means. All life is immortal except a small portion of the time.
That's not what it means, you don't even know what immortality means. Being an immortal being doesn't require death, you can just be living.
Immortality is being preserved after death, the definition changes. Do you even understand how immortality is defined in this context?
You can be preserved by death.  Your brain might die but you wouldn't really be dead.  You could be in a coma and be restored to consciousness later.  That's not immortality though; that's just having a good personality.  You can't live forever just because your brain stops
