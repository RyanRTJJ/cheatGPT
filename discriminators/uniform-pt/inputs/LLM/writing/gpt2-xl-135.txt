_________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ What would your name be on the back of the license plate? You've gotten lucky at times, and you are really lucky at others. A special birthday, anniversary, or even just a celebration that's very special to them. But often, you just have nothing. A car in your name still has to find its way to the garage at some pointâ€¦ or can it? Get the car back and see how long it will last and if there is any chance of getting its license back. No one is quite sure quite what to do to remove the sticker that is stuck on each car at any given moment. How can car owners keep track of the current number of people that have or have had their car, and how can they be sure that they are not dealing with a dealer who has removed all of these stickers before moving into a new property? Can auto insurance companies still be responsible even now? You're going to put your home up for sale, but the property has been sitting there for more than eight years before you even bought it. Can you sell it at a profit without having paid the mortgage off? Can the price be lowered if your name is on a deed? And how can you find someone to do all of this for you? This article will be a "novelistic, non-fictional" look at what it takes to restore a car and what a title might cost!
