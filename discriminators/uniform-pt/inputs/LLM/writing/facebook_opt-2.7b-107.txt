  Or use it for a campaign where each team is on a different planet. They all start out with their weapons, and the players must work together to defeat the alien invaders. Have them find their way out and figure out together how to kill the invaders.
That'd be kinda cool - or maybe the aliens actually just decide not to destroy humanity and instead have it turn them in a bunch, then you all do the same thing the aliens all did.
That would be cool. It would be funny if the aliens got captured and used to serve some purpose.
Have the players figure out what their purpose in life is, then the final battle is between the aliens and the PCs. Have them work together to make the last fight (after the aliens have turned humans into mindless soldiers) as intense as possible. Maybe the PCs are trying to save their planet from the aliens by destroying another alien race, too. Maybe the aliens are hiding a weapon in their planet that allows them to save another from destruction at their expense, but they'd give that same weapon to the PCs once they're in control.
That seems really cool too. Another good idea to do is to have them hide in a city and get turned into soldiers. So they have to work together again but this time on a different planet. It would be even better if they went to the moon, which is where the aliens are getting their ship from and all the other planets.
This is what we originally were going to do... but we ended up with the other plot and decided to use this as a backup plan. I did have one idea after the first thread, though - have an alien planet with very powerful weapons that's actually inhabited by human beings to work in conjunction with the PCs. If that still goes through then I'm definitely going to use it in another path.
