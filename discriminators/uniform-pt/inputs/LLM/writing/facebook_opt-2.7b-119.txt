 If true, how do you feel?
I would have thought that if they were going to do that, they would have a disclaimer on the link to read, but since it's just a hyperlink to wikipedia, I don't know.    I'm scared, and I'm sad, but mostly scared.  Even though my death is a long ways away, I would like to go peacefully at some point.  And like my username, it would be sad to die without having done anything great or terrible.    I may have thought too far ahead.
I don't think they'd allow that on the Internet though. You'd have to type in your details then press a tiny little "save". What?
Well yes, but you can also click delete.  And really when I say my death, I'm thinking it will be at home, from an easy fall or car accident.  Just trying to be as non specific as possible.     But I will admit, this all seems rather morbid.
My point is that people would have to type in their account details and save in order for it to work. What if one's account is made private? And it shows a blank screen? I think your death sounds too neat. Maybe you should be more likely to die in a car crash. You could die on a toilet. You could also die if you trip over an old piece of furniture in your kitchen on your way to grab something.
True. That's not a bad idea at all.  Although really my death would probably be in the back of someone's car, maybe a drunk driver.  Or maybe my death would be on the toilet, it happens a lot in there.    My name could be listed as my user name, or maybe someone could do it to mess with me.
You might also be buried in sand, too.
