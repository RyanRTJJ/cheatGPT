 What would happen if I did this?
Well, that sort of depends on whether I am in a world where there is magic or not.
No magic, but very strong religious undertones and an apocalyptic event in the future.
*I am leaving in a few hours to head back to my life in the city. I won't remember everything, because I will be too busy not caring about it.*.    If there is magic, I do believe you probably wouldn't make it into the front doors.
Ah, yeah, you're right. I was thinking of going through the front doors but I wasn't sure if it would work that way. But I guess magic won't be so much of an issue since the two doors open in opposite directions.
The other way is what you say is possible, in that case.
Is there anyone on Earth who could go through the doors (not be locked out, or have them not open in their favor)?
Not if they don't know about them. But the most powerful and skilled people are unlikely to be in the city.
The most powerful and skilled people would know about the doors. At the very least, there would be some kind of conspiracy between them and the gods.
Yes, but they'd probably be the minority. The gods would be a small minority, too.
But they had to have gotten somewhere to create the two doors, right? So it's safe to say they had a strong influence on how the world worked beforehand.  And the gods probably aren't small, so I'm not sure what the percentage of them would be.  I mean, the gods could easily run circles around all of this and it would be all for naught. Because there's always a weakness somewhere.
That's true. But they likely couldn't go through the front doors. They'd just have to sit it out somewhere where they have an escape mechanism.
