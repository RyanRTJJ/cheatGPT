********* When you're alone, you don't have a clue what awaits you. Or maybe you don't know. Your own brain is a closed loop, unable to recognize that it's falling apart. The thoughts and ideas loop and loop again, until finally your brain stops. And that's when you have to ask yourself a question. No idea what I'm talking about? You don't have to know what's going on? Well then. Here's the script I wrote that I think you can follow to learn more about the process. "Oh? You'd like to try and catch?" That's right. What does one look like these days without their number? And what does the number mean? I'm not a mathematician myself, but I'll give you my best guess. The number 22 is the final number of numbers which will fit in the world in one. And here's where the world becomes much bigger. The numbers begin to spiral upward. As the numbers spiral upward with no end in sight, the number gets larger. As the number gets larger, the world becomes smaller. Smaller in every dimension. The spiral will continue. As the spiral continues, every number smaller than your number. The numbers will continue to spiral. They are now infinite. With no end in sight. A small world, a very small world. A few atoms separated by an indeterminate distance. I'm sorry, but this is not something that is likely to leave. You, of course, are out of luck. You're not getting anything bigger. It is as simple as that. There is nothing you can do. Except to enjoy your time in this tiny world. Enjoy a few moments when the world is so much larger on the other side of the number 22. And enjoy your life, even if it's all about the numbers above and behind your name. The numbers above your name are always in place. And so are the numbers above and behind your number.
