 What does he want in life?

This is the story of how I became a writer. It is the story of how I met a woman who changed everything, and this story is the story of how we married, and this story is also the story of how I have tried to be the greatest husband in history.

I was in a bookstore when I saw him, sitting in the children's section reading to a boy. He had an old fedora hat with a wide, brimmed brim that came up and then covered his ears and made him look just like a character out of A Christmas Story. He looked old and young, young and old. He sat in that chair with that hat and I just watched him, and then we looked at each other, and I could see that it was right. This was who I wanted to see. He was everything I'd ever thought I was looking for, and what I had imagined my future would be.

I looked over the children's books. He had a collection of Little Golden Books, including The Lion King. He had some books by Dr. Seuss, some others by Dr. Seuss too, and a few picture books and board books. I watched him read silently, and I remember wanting to cry. I wanted to read aloud to him, and he wanted to read all of them aloud to me. We made that first plan to read all of the books aloud to each other.

He sat next to me in that small section of books for just a few moments, and I watched him read to a child who had just turned five, who was wearing a t-shirt that said He'll Be Back, he'll be back, he'll come back. I wanted to know his name.

We had to leave. He had other people to meet. He walked out the door and I just sat there. I watched him walk away until he was lost in the crowd. I had found this woman that I knew I want to be married
