### 
What if the very world war being fought on our galaxyâ€™s surface was being played out on a microscopic scale in the cold, dark depths of the ocean - underwater?

This is a concept piece depicting what a battle like that might look like. The world as we know it has ended, and the tiny combatants are preparing for war in an epic struggle of wills.

Who could their enemy possibly be?

The first of our three concepts is now available. And it's based on the game - A Game Of Thrones: The Board Game!

You can read an excerpt HERE.

The second concept we have is based on the first game of our 'new series'

S.N.O.T. - An Alien Race Fights For The Right To Stay (S.N.O.T.)

You can read an excerpt HERE.

And finally, another new concept piece. This is the very first game of our new series and it's one of many to come.   
S.N.O.T. is a game of political correctness gone horribly wrong. Players take on the role of two opposing worlds desperate to establish and defend their own colonies in another Galaxy. The other colony seeks to use the situation to gain the upper hand and force the other colony off their home world and into deep space, where they can be wiped out.
