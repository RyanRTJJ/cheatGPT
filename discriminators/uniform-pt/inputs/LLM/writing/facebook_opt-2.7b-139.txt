>No time travel allowed.  I love this rule, but you wouldn't need to follow it - there's no story to tell if the future was that much like the past.
You could make it so the future wasn't that much like the past. I'm guessing this guy is writing about the near future with a lot of things that are going to be a little different than things are today.
That might work, yeah. "A dystopia where the near future is as far as the eye can see."
Or you could also flip it and say that there is a utopia where the past was really crappy and the people live like there is still the past.
Yeah, but there's nothing wrong with the idea of a 'utopia' - you don't need to change history to make a good story.
I know but it can throw off the story and the pacing can get weird. It's like a double set up, I could only imagine how a person trying to make a great story might need to deal with that.
You probably have a very different outlook than I do - I know plenty of people who love that sort of thing.
Like it? I guess I can see it but like what would you do with the premise and not the premise? Would you change time? And how would you change it enough to make it so there isn't a connection?
In a sci-fi or fantasy setting, I'd say you could stick to the original premise and just write about how the future has changed, in an interesting way.
Okay, I guess I see your point, I do like the idea of making a story for the sake of writing. Good luck next time!
