 If you give readers a novel where the narrator says something bad about a child's brother or sister, but doesn't deliver its description of what that lie actually was, that would be a bad story, for example, so you need to try and improve your prose around it. A good example is Mark Twain's letter to his mother about the beginning of the first chapter and the author's second chapter.  (And a few others too....)  Don't let that make you get out the real, honest facts that the story is telling your reader.  It's actually easier to get the real truth from the story and more satisfying, and more believable, from an actual story, as opposed to some fakes or fiction. In short, the author is responsible for the story's message. By contrast, the author can't directly tell readers what his story is telling. All he can do is give them a story for them to think of with real consequences after being told. How often do people go to bed knowing that the story they wrote (without knowing the real outcome) did not end up with anything but just one good thing? And it gets worse, because in some cases, you get that same story even if your story didn't do that. And this all happens before the story or a character actually gets into a position to see the truth, or even be able to decide what the story does.
What's important right now is that readers don't have to worry about writing in this way.  They can put the story aside. They can let yourself think about it. Maybe they can explain the whole thing better (as a little experiment, if I may) to just see what happens.  I think that's exactly what we should do in this case; we should write a story like this.  Here's
