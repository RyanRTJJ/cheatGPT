 I'm reading 'The Island of Dr Moreau' right now, and I thought of a bunch of dystopias I'd like to read--many of which would also make fantastic movies.
I loved that book when I read it as a teenager, as I recall it was fairly disturbing. I really love the concept of something where humanity can turn into something totally new, and what the consequences of that might be.
Yeah, it wasn't that scary or weird, per se, but something about a scientist experimenting on an ape that looks like a person and transforms him into a thing that would then be able to take over another person scared me.   I really want to do this. You could call it 'The Beast Within', or something like that, and it could be a sci-fi/thriller with some fantasy elements in it. Kinda like Harry Potter meets The Matrix or something.
Definitely a good idea. I have also considered writing a series where the main character discovers they have some rare power, and gets sucked into one of three parallel worlds, where they are either evil or the good guy. The one where they are evil is the one where their soulmate dies.
That is a very interesting concept.  If you ever get a chance to do writing or film, I'd still love to hear about it.
Definitely! If you find yourself in Australia for some reason, and interested in something, don't hesitate to drop me a line. I would love to discuss my idea with someone who is actually willing to read my ideas, and give me their constructive criticisms.
I'm in North America--I was just in Melbourne, Australia, while on vacation with my family. I don't really know anybody here though.
Wow. Nice. Yeah, if you find yourself in Australia for holidays again, please let me know if you are interested. I would be glad to discuss my ideas in greater detail.
