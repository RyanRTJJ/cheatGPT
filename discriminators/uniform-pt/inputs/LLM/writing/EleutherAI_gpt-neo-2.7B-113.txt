Here we are! Remember to include the title of the story before the end of the prompt!

A/N: Welcome to my first story here at the Wordless Wednesday Blog. I hope that it will be not only a fun thing for me to share, but also that you, dear reader, learn more about us who are a part of this group. I am glad you're here.

So remember, you've got to follow along with me. I can't wait to see where this series of novelettes will take us!

The next one is going to be a little slower, mainly due to the fact that I'm a bit scared to write another novelette (but at least there's something new and different to say this time, I believe). Maybe next Wednesday I'll get inspired to actually write a complete full-length novel. I still have that one I'm pretty sure I should write, but I just don't need it quite yet.

Now, on with the new series.

And no, you're not going to go back to the end of the previous one for the start of the next one. Unless I decide to. It's all good, though. ;)

"You're drunk,” he said as he started towards her. "You need to go home, Lynx! And don't think I will drive you!”

She lifted her hand, a wave of red hot fury coming from it
