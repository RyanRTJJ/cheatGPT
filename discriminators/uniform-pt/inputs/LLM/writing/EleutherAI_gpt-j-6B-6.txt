A:

So after a lot of thought, here's what I came up with:

 You take the first step to the right and follow it with the next one and keep doing that until you make it back to the starting point. To stop, you need the right amount of time to go back.

 So for instance, it would take a certain amount of time to go to the starting point in one step. You would need to figure out if that time is a little more or less than a year. That way, if you went back to when you started in one day, you wouldn't have time to turn around, start to go back, and hit yourself on the head with a hammer. 

 So I think that basically, the premise is that going faster takes you to greater distances in time (think about the arrow of time), and slowing down lets you go farther in time. Thus, you use this to go back.

 This also explains the premise of time-travel. Because if you know when you started, you know when you ended, and can work backwards from there (assuming you know how fast you were running/walking when you started - if not, you'll need to do some extrapolation). It also explains the premise that you need to figure out the exact amount of time it takes to get back when you do it a certain way. That way, if there is a mis-calculation and you actually end up back when you started but a day earlier, you won't be sent back to the present, but will be killed by a falling boulder.

As for why,

 It's about as far from something simple as it could be. You'd do everything right and start, and every turn you take seems to take
