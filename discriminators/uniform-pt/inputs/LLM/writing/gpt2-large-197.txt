What's your favorite quote or essay to use in your story? 
What is a plot device and what is a plot hole? 
Give me an example of someone who's done something really extraordinary in one way or another. This shouldn't feel like that you make a mistake in the definition. If it sounds like you're trying too hard. When someone gets it wrong, they're usually afraid that they have missed something and should not have done it. When you're trying, you feel free and confident. It makes you feel like you really don't hold anything back.
