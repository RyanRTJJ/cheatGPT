I'm game for a game, we can do this Reddit meet up thingy.
Amen.
Are you guys actually going to do this?
I don't know man. I've never done a meet up before. I'll find out.
I'll be your wingman. I've done a few and they've been good times.
Alright. Let's get this done.
You got the link to the game?
I made the game. I just posted it to /r/pkmnheroes
Sorry. I was on mobile and didn't see the link
Oh, well, it's okay. Thanks for getting back with me though. :D
Np. Just curious, is your game going to have an online mode?
I was hoping to do something like the GBA versions of Pokemon XD. But I'm trying something new. It's going to be more of a puzzle where the player has to build a gym by beating it before it falls into the hands of the opposing team. There's a pokemon you can add to your gym and every time you beat a gym you can get points. Then by the end of the game the points build into the gym itself.
Interesting. What's the story behind this idea?
It's kind of simple actually. I wanted to build a gym as a kid, but I didn't have any pokemon. That was the start, really. So I made this game to get back to playing pokemon.
Well I think it's cool because I'm sure I know what it looks like. I like it!
Thanks! I'm glad to hear you like the idea. :D
Hey hey, have you ever had any ideas for a story based on the game in progress? I'm really glad to find someone who actually wants to do it!
It's pretty much what you described here. It's just going to be in black and white, so it's a lot easier to work with.
It sounds like a great idea. Are you going to take this all the way through to release?
Yeah. I'm
