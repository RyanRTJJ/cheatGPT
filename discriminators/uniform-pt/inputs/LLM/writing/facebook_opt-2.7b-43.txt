 (Don't worry it is just for fun)!
Well my friend was the one that did most of it so...  He was found "not guilty" as well
I mean like as the writer, where you have to make everything sound like it is true and plausible. Then you have to decide what to base it on.  Or just do what I did and say you are guilty.
You're guilty. You and your friend were both found not guilty based on circumstantial evidence.
What is the crime?
Drugging and rape
Then I would probably go with his scenario: you take the blame, while he gets out.
He raped and then murdered a woman. It was also his 5th time raping that year but he was found not guilty so I guess I should have added that.
Then he killed her, so you're the only one who's at fault there.
I guess... I can't remember who it was now
Yeah, the only way I'd try to justify this as a murder is to say that he killed her in cold blood and I wouldn't think of any other type of murder being plausible.
Yeah well I guess the people who did the trial were stupid, then
Not really. It's pretty hard to do some kind of murder in cold blood, and if they found him guilty they would have gone for a much harsher punishment.
Yeah okay I understand that thank you.
I see no problem being helped. If you ever find any problems again, feel free to pm me.
You don't mind at all if your username comes into play then yes, you can pm me. :3
I'm glad you took my advice :D  Oh actually, can I ask you a small question regarding your username? Do you have a reason for choosing that username, or is it just out of randomness?
You can ask me lol but I wouldn't tell you. You can ask my friend.
Alright, I'll just go to him, but thanks anyways.
