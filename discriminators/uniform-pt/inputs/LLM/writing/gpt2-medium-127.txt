Please answer no to all of the above questions. I really don't want to hear much about the dogs you think are dead! Send me a picture of your dog if you're able and I'll use it as evidence, or just send over an outline and give you a short synopsis on the details (if I've read your story). If we both accept at the conclusion of your survey, we'll agree that this is one of the craziest stories in every book we've ever read (unless there's a really fun side quest or funny scene that makes it truly crazy).


You are welcome to write two other entries in the story too, just that their title(s) will also be entered. If you win a giveaway, I'll award a random reader the link to one of your entries and include it here.


Thank you again for reading my post! If all goes smoothly, I hope you'll enter your answer at the end. I'll have a second random reader answer this story in the next couple weeks so don't worry about coming up with new titles. Just be aware of my usual disclaimer as well as my expectation that no matter what we do we'll come up with at least a couple dozen "wild" submissions and maybe some entries that I love, too :)


Someday. (Or, well, it won't! I'll post a link to the thread you've entered in case your story just doesn't make it).
