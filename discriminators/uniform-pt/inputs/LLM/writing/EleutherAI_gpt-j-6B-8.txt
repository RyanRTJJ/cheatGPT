 
But the first memory I would have told you was from two years ago,  
when I was thirteen and living in an apartment in a residential neighborhood in New Jersey.  
It was a clear, beautiful night and I was walking home with my neighbor. He was about to have sex with her.  
And then, out of nowhere, some memory flashed in my head.  
I had only been with her for a few days.  
Then, suddenly, it was as if the sky had opened and an explosion happened, and I woke up in my bed.  
My heart pounding and I was freezing cold.  
I had never been that scared in my entire life. But it seemed normal  
because when I'd been born I was scared, too. I am sure it was the first time anyone ever hurt me.  
But it wasn't until years later that any of this would make sense  
and come back to me. It would help me get to the point where I could tell you  
the first memory I would ever have told you.
The Night That Changed Everything

1. Write a story that takes place on the night  
that you were born.

2. Write a story that takes place on the night  
that you broke a rule you knew you'd regret if found out.

3. Write a story that tells how you began  
to learn who you are.  
What changes when you begin to think  
who you are and what you're good at, and who you're not.

I had to laugh.  
Maybe I was a little bit crazy, but that was because, as they say,

I was only as strong as my weakest link.

You get better at pretending, and the next time
