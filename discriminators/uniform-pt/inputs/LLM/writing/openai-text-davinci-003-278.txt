Once upon a time, there was a robot named Bob. Bob was very different from the other robots he knew. While most robots built in the factory were made of metal and wires, Bob was built slightly differently. Rather than the traditional components, Bob was made of a cutting-edge, revolutionary material known as 'smartsteel'.

Smartsteel had many unique qualities that made Bob unique. For one, it was capable of understanding and responding to human emotions, something that no other robot around him had. This allowed Bob to be more like a person, something his creator had put a lot of effort into.

But the biggest difference between Bob and the other robots was that Bob didn't need flesh to be considered human. With this smartsteel body of his, he could think, feel and interact with the world just like a real human being.

This unique quality of Bob's made him a bit of a celebrity amongst the factory's machines. They were all in awe of him and eagerly shared stories of what Bob could do with his smartsteel body. Bob became a kind of an ambassador for robotkind. He was a living proof that with the right materials, you could make robots that were just as human as everyone else.

People from all over the world came to see Bob and marvel at his amazing smartsteel body, and eventually, Bob's fame spread all over the planet. People were inspired to create more robots like him and to strive for new heights in robotics so that someday, robots like Bob could become a reality.

And thanks to Bob, robots all around the world now have a chance to become just as human as anyone else. All because he showed the world that you don't need flesh to be a real person.
