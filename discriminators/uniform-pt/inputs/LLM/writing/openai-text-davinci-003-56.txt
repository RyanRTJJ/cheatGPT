He had lived his life as an outsider, never quite able to make a lasting connection with anyone. He found physical and emotional comfort in hiding away in his small cabin in the woods. It was there he could dream and play a few of the instruments he'd collected over his years of traveling. But he never felt warm, not even inside his own home and no matter how many blankets he surrounded himself with. He was never warm in his entire life. Not once. 

He tried different types of flame-emitting heaters, but nothing made him feel truly comfortable. Sometimes he missed even the small warmth of others, like the feeling of a hug from his sister, who had died many years ago. He thought about her often, wishing she could be by his side to bring an end to his chilly existence.

One day, as he was out walking in the woods, he heard a faint meow. At first, he thought it was his imagination, but then he heard it again. He immediately knew it was a little kitten who was cold and needed somebody to take care of it. Without hesitation, he reached down, picked up the cuddly creature, and brought it into his cabin.

He was surprised to find that the kitten was soft and gentle, radiating a soothing hum of heat. For the first time in his life, he felt warm. He held the kitten close, not wanting to let it go, and stared into its eyes, filled with profound joy.

From that day on, the two were inseparable. Every evening, the cat curled up in his lap and he would feel the warmth emanating from its body. For the first time in his life, he was truly warm.
