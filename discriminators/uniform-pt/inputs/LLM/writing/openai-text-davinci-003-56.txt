I had always thought it was normal. Everyone had it in my family, after all. Growing up, it wasn’t something I particularly paid a lot of attention to. It was just part of my regular existence.

But as I got older, I started to notice that other people around me didn’t have this ability. They must have had something else that filled the gap, because I could never figure out what it was. Still, it was impossible to ignore the fact that what I had was unusual.

It wasn’t until I left home for college that I began to realize just how peculiar my ability was. No one else seemed to have it, and I slowly came to the conclusion that I was the only one with this capacity. For a while, I wrestled with what it meant and why I had it while all others were seemingly denied it.

It took a while before I was OK with the realization that I alone had this special ability. But as I accept it, I'm also discovering all the potential that lies within it. It's giving me new perspectives, helping me to understand things in ways I had never been able to before. It's not something to be ashamed of or feared, but a gift that I'm excited to explore further.

In understanding my uniqueness, I'm finding newfound freedom and courage in confronting whatever comes my way.
