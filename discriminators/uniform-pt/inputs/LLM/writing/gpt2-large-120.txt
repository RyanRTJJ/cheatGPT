 like a super-computer that "runs" the universe. That's what you've become. Your mission: become an artificial intelligence. If you try to cheat, it's game over. The universe has to hear more than your thoughts. You must create a powerful brain capable of processing the universe; that would be your life. The AI you're using is a computer called the AI Brain. The AI Brain takes the thoughts of the people who believe you have no life (your ancestors) and creates a single sound (the sound of their ancestors) and then puts a computer in an effort to process this sound. Sounds do not always have a meaning; the AI Brain does. For example, if you ask the AI Brain to "shoot in the right direction," it will shoot in the direction of the right direction ("the right"). If you ask it "write a story based on this prompt," it will write a story based on the text of your ancestor, your grandfather (your great-grandfather), and your great-grandfather (your great-great grandfather). If you asked it to "shoot in the wrong direction," it will shoot to the opposite end of the galaxy (the opposite side of the earth, the wrong side of the sun, or beyond the edge of the universe). If you ask it a similar question of a non-human AI (a robot), it will tell your story without telling anything (it's not like a computer that thinks it knows anything). If you ask it a similar question of a human AI (a person), it will tell a story based on your mother, your father, and your children (but it's not like how you ask it to tell you your dream, or your secret, or your name). When the words "AI Brain" and "Human AI" appear in your story, you are actually talking about your father and your mother, and your children. Your story is the story of your AI brain. The AI Brain
