 I like to imagine this person as if they were in some kind of life machine, so the scene plays out as if they were trapped in a minefield. If the person manages to get out, then I think the scene just keeps progressing. What do you do when a story's too heavy on words but not heavy enough on plot?  The following prompts from "If the plot were easy I wouldn't be doing this," are good for changing that.
