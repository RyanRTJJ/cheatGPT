  You go to a bookstore and you buy a book to read on that premise.
Thank you.
No problem.  If you write one, tag my inbox and I'll upvote it.
Wow, you're awesome! Thank you!  One of his scars he keeps in his top pocket. He has a secret drawer full of things like this and stuff he wrote in school. I was going to make my own story in my head, but I thought what better place to ask and get suggestions from people who know him? I can't really write about how I met him or how we became so close, but maybe I can write about how they became so close.
My vote is for you to write one, since you're actually in his head, and that's what writing is really about, the characters and story. You have the story, and I'm sure you have a great idea for what you'd like to write.   So go for it, please. I'm in, too.
Thanks very much. I'm totally out of touch with fiction, but I'll be using this prompt as a rough outline. Thanks again for the support. Happy writing.  Also, are you going to make a story in my head? I'm going to use the same prompt you've been using.
Sure, whatever you fancy.   And yeah, I'll be using the *same* writing prompt, as it is from a prompt generator that is a fanfic I use sometimes.
I'd be interested in seeing it. Could you let me know when it's up?
Absolutely :D  I'll PM it to you. And I believe I have another one saved, will have to check.
You are awesome for doing that.
