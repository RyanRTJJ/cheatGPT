It all started when Will was three years old. During his typical antics and wiggles, he noticed that every time he stepped back he was taken back in time. By the time, he was five, he was already adept at walking sideways, which served as the only way to stay in the present.

Though he didn't know it, Will's parents were growing more and more concerned. They tried to talk to him about why he walked that way, but Will didn't understand himself. As days passed and the strange habit continued, Will's parents did the only thing they could think of — they took him to a psychologist.

The psychologist took one look at Will and his sideways walking, and immediately diagnosed him with temporal disorientation. He explained to them the phenomenon of time-travel that their son had stumbled on, and then set out to help them find a way to rid Will of the habit.

But, no matter what he did, the psychologist couldn't seem to find a way to stop Will from walking sideways. So, in a last ditch attempt to keep their son safe from unintentional time-travel, Will's parents took him out for a morning of dancing.

At first, Will didn't understand why he had to participate in such an activity, but then he realized that dancing would be a great way to use his 'special skill' without his parent's ever noticing — and they didn't.

Will was soon running and dancing with ease, and the habit of walking sideways slowly began to fade away. Now, at the age of twenty, Will can easily walk forward, but still break out in a shuffle every now and then — a useful reminder of his time-traveling years.
