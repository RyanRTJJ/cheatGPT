 used to drink soda.

The engineers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison discovered that some molecules are able to cling to bottles even when they are dipped back into liquid. The researchers then attached this material to plastic caps that could not only be used to seal bottles but also absorb liquid, creating watertight sealing.

The scientists tested their product, called M-Slick, on bottles filled with different types of beverages. When they heated these bottles to 90 degrees Celsius (194 degrees Fahrenheit), they discovered that many of them had a coating of molecules on the inside that could cling to the sides of the bottle, making it difficult to remove the bottle from the container.

"The liquids and solids move around in the bottle and they may not be able to separate, which means it is easier to break the bottle," said researcher Daniel Nocera.

Bottles with M-Slick are also more slippery, which is important since they make up more than half of the liquid that leaks out when a beverage is left in a bottle.

The researchers plan to develop a water-resistant version of the film with other molecules attached to it, since the coating does not work if the liquid surrounding the sides of the bottle is too cold.

The study was published online in the journal ACS Nano.
