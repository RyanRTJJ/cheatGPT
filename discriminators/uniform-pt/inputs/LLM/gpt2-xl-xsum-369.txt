 occasion as he reads out from Shakespeare's Hamlet as he has for centuries.

Bond will be read out of Hamlet by the Queen in a private audience, which has not previously been seen by the public. On her behalf, her official spokesman also read out a line from the play in the presence of the press.

The programme is a series of readings that have taken place every decade. In the last decade, there were three readings in Shakespeare's time by Bond: one, by George Bernard Shaw, another by Andrew Lloyd Webber and a final by Shakespeare himself, who will read parts of Hamlet, As you like it and Othello.

Bond will not be alone in the reading at this celebration of the Bard, as Christopher Plummer will also perform the part of Duke of Windsor from Tuesday until the end of September. This will be the first time since 1955 that Britain has had a major male role played by a former Bond actor since Anthony Blunt.

Blunt was James Bond, playing the role in 1954's You Only Live Twice, but quit after he became a father and the actor retired after 1967's Diamonds Are Forever.

The next opportunity to see Plummer in action as the Duke of Windsor will come in October for the launch of the new James Bond film, which is said to be an extension of the character's "more sophisticated" films, but with some improvements.

Christopher Plummer will be the lead of Prince Charles to be played by Sir Ben Kingsley, while the cast includes Naomie Harris as the Duchess of Cornwall. The film has not been announced to the public.

Bond's 50th birthday is the 10th anniversary of Skyfall, with some predicting that the film's success will ensure the series will stay around for at least an
