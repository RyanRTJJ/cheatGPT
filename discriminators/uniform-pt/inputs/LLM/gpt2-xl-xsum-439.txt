 could, while Greek authorities were carrying all migrants who had already made it onto Europe's shores.

The boat's captain told the Irish broadcaster RTE that many of the Syrians were from the village of Deir al-Zor, northeast of the city which was the site of a deadly chemical attack last month.

"Most of them have health problems: asthma, diabetes, stomach problems. Many patients had severe problems and they died. There were some babies on the boat with skin problems, diarrhea," Captain Abu Abdullah said.

An Irish naval ship carrying migrants rescued a number of people Wednesday on the coast of north Africa. The ship picked up 15 people from two boats that were intercepted in the Mediterranean Sea between Morocco and Sicily on Wednesday.

The latest arrivals included four Syrians, one Tunisian and four others from sub-Saharan African countries including Eritrea, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea, the official said.

The migrants were taken aboard the Stena C. Not much else was known about the passengers' nationalities. However, they come from countries such as Ethiopia, Sudan, Eritrea, Gambia and Niger.

Many fleeing the conflicts in the Middle East and Afghanistan, as well as poverty and joblessness in Africa, have been trying to reach Europe.

However, hundreds have drowned or were left stranded after smugglers overloaded them into ships, leaving them adrift in the sea. And those who make it ashore to Europe face the task of integrating in a new, impoverished society.
