 police as "impressive" but with heavy footfall being reported.

Hundreds of people, mainly young men, appeared to have turned out en masse, as well as large numbers of female supporters from both clubs.

Aberdeen fans turned up in force in their trademark black tops. Many carried signs saying "F*** off, Celtic", "No more Glasgow" and "Aberdeen FC the most offensive fucking club in world football".

Argyle fans took to the streets to promote their club's return to Scottish football, while Celtic and Rangers fans took to Edinburgh city centre for a match against Dundee United.

Hundreds of people including students and tourists visited the city centre's famous Hogmanay celebrations.

The Celtic supporters were greeted in the city by a Scottish Defence League (SDL) members, who were filmed punching an Aberdeen supporter in the head.

The crowd of demonstrators, who appeared heavily drunk, had already begun to set fire to bins and rubbish bins throughout the city.

More than 100 police officers made arrests at the game on Monday night - the most since the sectarian disturbances in 2014.

The violence and disorder began before kick-off at the stadium, as the Celtic supporters, who had travelled to Glasgow from around the North and the South of Scotland, began throwing missiles from the front of their bus.

Scuffles broke out as police tried to control the two sets of fans, with the two sets of supporters both trying to attack officers with the same items - bottles and flares.

The violence spilled on to the ground, where supporters, some of them with placards or banners, continued to throw missiles and smoke bombs.

Aberdeen supporters clashed with rival supporters at Buchanan stand before kick-off.

On the streets of the city, Aberdeen supporters hurled smoke bombs, bricks and bottles and set off fireworks, while Celtic fans were among those who lit flares and fired fireworks.
