 government to set up facilities and set up a scheme for women to reach out to healthcare facilities with no appointment necessary, so that they may be able to receive abortions.

A few years ago, the Supreme Court was hearing a petition filed by the National Campaign for the Protection of Human Rights of the Child (NAPCAR) that sought to set up similar centres across the country.

In 2014, several NGOs that had started work in the area reported that several women were turning up at their centres wanting to give birth, as they were not able to find any help or advice. "We provided her with medicines, but since the health department does not provide any counselling or free health checkups to patients, she got a saline filled syringe and injected herself at home. The next day, she miscarried," said Raghavendra, a senior NAPCAR worker.

This was the first such case of an illegal abortion being committed in Jharkhand, the first state that had passed a Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTP Act) in 2013. It brought the total number of states in which the practice is being practiced to five.

The state has seen an increase in number of abortions since the act was passed. According to figures of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), at least 6,388 clandestine abortions were performed in Jharkhand in 2013, the year the act was passed, against only 1,723 cases in 2013.

The figures were compared with the corresponding figures for 2012 (2,555 cases) and 2011 (2,335 cases). While 5,567 abortions were done in Jharkhand in 2013, when the law was passed, the figures for 2012 were 3,077 cases while for 2011 it was three.

At least 1,350 of those performed were induced by the use of drugs during labour, said a NAPCAR worker. The woman was allegedly sent to Alibaug (a town in Pithoragarh district), a city in the Pithoragarh block of the district, for the an illegal abortion. After the birth of a girl, the parents told the child welfare department this happened without the knowledge of the child welfare committee where the girl was registered.
