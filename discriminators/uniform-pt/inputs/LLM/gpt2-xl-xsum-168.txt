 the Reds' success.

Pressed on how he persuaded them, they replied: "It came from above - it's got to come from above." A few weeks later, the Reds beat England 2-1 to clinch three points.

However, the Welsh Football Association said their preparations were behind schedule with the match postponed because of "unprecedented heavy snowfall" over the border and the English FA's stance on moving the match back - or even cancelling it - during such conditions remained unclear.

While Liverpool's first game was set for the following Monday - a game at home to Sheffield United - Strachan said the Welsh FA were keen to start a training camp in January.

"The Irish FA have a difficult task in front of them as our game is on the 13th and we feel with the weather that we cannot progress into that game," Strachan said.

"The weather has had a big effect on what preparation we want to do and it's not easy.

"We've been here, we've worked really hard this week. We can't rush into a game that is the last opportunity for the team to go to that next stage.

"We're hoping that next week at least we can begin some activity and start a process towards getting ready for the next game because we think it is vital we get a good test because we have one of our rivals here. I have the utmost respect for the Republic of Ireland, they are a good team on the pitch but they cannot guarantee us that the game can be played if we play today.

"We should expect that in the last few games we get a good training match, which is important, a chance to see who are contenders and who are not and then we will see where we can progress, which we believe we can in our next match at home against Sheffield United."

FIFA rules state that the home team must be the lower-placed teams in their respective groups and that the lowest-placed team from each group must be relegated if no group winner is found
