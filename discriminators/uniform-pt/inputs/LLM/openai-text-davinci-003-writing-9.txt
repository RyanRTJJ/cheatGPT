The night started out like any other. Edgar had just finished his dinner and was relaxing on the couch watching television. Little did he know, this would be his final night.

Suddenly, Edgar felt a chill go through his body, and his vision began to blur. He knew right away that he was dying. He stumbled to the floor and moments later he was gone.

But he wasn't done yet. He rose from his dead body, in spectral form, and followed it around. He was a ghost now - unable to communicate or influence the world.

He watched in horror as his zombie body attacked and ate people. Their screams of pain and terror echoed in his ears and a sick feeling filled his stomach. He felt guilty that he had caused this, but there was nothing he could do.

He was a ghost now, doomed to follow his zombie body in eternal torment and regret.
