 has been stepped up at public events, like sporting events and concerts.

Brussels, home to 28 million people, is still on edge after Friday's suicide bombings in March that killed 32 people in the city's main airport and a metro station.

The bombers were on their way to Paris, but the Belgian capital has been the scene of heightened security for two weeks as Europe struggles to integrate thousands of refugees, many of them from the Middle East.

Mali, a West African nation on the Sahel, also suffered a major attack by extremists in early November. Islamic State also claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Bamako, Mali, earlier this month that claimed the lives of 38 people.

In Paris, the suicide bombers struck at a crowded concert in the city's north-eastern 15th arrondissement.

At least eight people died in the attacks and another 120 had been taken to hospital, including four people held hostage inside the Bataclan concert hall, on top of the more than 80 people killed and wounded at the stadium.

One witness told French media that one of the attackers had a Kalashnikov assault rifle.

"The explosions went off as we were leaving the Bataclan," he wrote on Twitter. "There was blood all over the floor."

French police and anti-terrorist forces are said to be securing the rest of the city, the site of the French national stadium and other public buildings.
