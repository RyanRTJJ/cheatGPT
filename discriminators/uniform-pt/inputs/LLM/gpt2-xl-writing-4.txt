********** I wish this was true. For as long as I can remember, I've heard the rumors of a town where everyone has the same name. There's one exception: there are always two people named Joseph Easley in the library at my school. They call their youngest one Josiah, but they're a bit different than the actual, real Joseph… There's an interesting story behind why he's called Joseph, though. As I'd been learning throughout my time at school, there were people from all around the world. Even though I'm not a scientist, there was always talk that every country had a different spelling for their given names. There was even a country that spelled their name with the letter T. So I wondered what it was about the name Josiah that made it so different from the others…. ….. ….. It was only a few minutes after my first day at school.

"Aren't you supposed to be playing hide and seek?" "Yeah, I am," I said non-committally. "Did someone say something?" "Oi," James scolded. "Listen, Josiah. Don't tell anyone it's you. There's some bad people after you." "It's not me," I muttered. "It's them. The dark wizards." "But who?" Josiah asked, confused until I told him. "Look over there," James said, pointing. I peeked my head over and saw a blonde woman with dark brown skin and long red hair walking towards us. Her hair was braided into twin tails sticking all the way down to her waist. Her dark green eyes were half-closed, like she was trying to sleep. At the same time, she had what looked like an earring in the shape
