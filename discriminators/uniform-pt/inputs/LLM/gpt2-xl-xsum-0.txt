A second bank, the National Australia Bank, cut rates earlier this year, but cut the deposit rate in October. The central bank has a $3.74 trillion monetary base and a benchmark 0.5% federal funds rate — the equivalent of a 5.5% federal funds rate for Australians who hold deposits at the bank.

The Reserve Bank expects economic growth, as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics' seasonally adjusted Gross Domestic Product (GDP), to remain the same this year.

However, it said growth could slip slightly in the following quarter as the effects of the "cyclical" adjustment in the mining investment boom, which it said last quarter was "modest", dissipate

"GDP growth is expected to ease gradually in the year ahead as the cyclical adjustment in mining investment over the last quarter of 2013 is completed," it said.

The bank said while "it would be premature to ascribe a specific timing to any potential slowdown", it was expected the Reserve Bank would maintain its inflation target of 2.5% for the next four years, as it had done since 2014.

"The key drivers for the underlying trend in interest rates — the extent and speed of the recovery in the labor market and the extent and speed of inflation gains — remain in place," it said.

"Although growth in investment is likely to be modest in the second half of the year, the economic outlook remains broad-based and accommodative, and this is reflected in the RBA's outlook."

The RBA will not raise rates in December as previously planned, it said, adding that it expects economic growth to weaken this year and next.

Bank of England moves up rate forecast

The Bank of England moved up its forecast for growth in the UK economy to 2.5% in the second half of the year, from 1.7% in May with wage growth expected to slow.

"We expect continued moderate growth in the economy and a return to a more normal inflation rate in the next few months, with risks rising from the UK's recent activity data," it said in the statement, adding growth this year would be closer to that of the US and the euro area.
