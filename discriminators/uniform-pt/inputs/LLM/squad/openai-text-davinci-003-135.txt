Virgil's works were praised for their artistic skill, their beauty of language, and their description of real moral values. His verse is marked by clarity, nobility, and grandeur, and his style plays with the traditional elements of epic while favouring restraint and subtlety over loud rhetoric. He manages to convey with extraordinary precision not only adjectives regarding emotions and illusions, but also nuances of atmosphere. His use of mythical themes and images to convey powerful messages about human nature and relationships has earned him the reputation of being a great poet.

In the Aeneid, Virgil combines a profound knowledge of the Homeric epics with a skillful mastery of themes such as the sense of duty and the struggle between culture and nature. He brings accuracy and a subtle awareness of the human condition to his writings. It is not only for its artistry and its moral content that Virgil's work is remembered but also as a powerful story of the Trojan War, which provided the Roman people with a great source of inspiration and identity. 

The influence of Virgil's work lasted through the ages, inspiring later Roman poets such as Ovid and Lucan, and was translated and admired by the European Renaissance. His works continue to be enjoyed and studied today, and his poetic style is renowned for its classicism and timeless beauty.
