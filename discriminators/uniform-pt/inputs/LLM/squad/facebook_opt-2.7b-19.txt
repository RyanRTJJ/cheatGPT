dale's previous career with Status Quo and Deep Purple. The single "Burning Love" reached number five in the UK Singles Chart, and was the highest-selling single of the year on both sides of the Atlantic. The album produced a number one hit in the United Kingdom with "Lonely Housewife", while its follow up "Burning Love" was number two. Although the album and singles failed to garner as much attention from younger audiences as their predecessors, its success was still notable for having topped the UK album charts on two occasions, and for having entered the American charts as well.

Coverdale then released his first compilation album for the Mercury label in February 1988, comprising 10 previously released singles and the album. Some artists had already released tracks from the compilations on single, including White Zombie with "Screaming for Vengeance", The Damned with "Never Gonna Dance Again", and Whitesnake with "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" and "The Woman I Love". "Burning Love" also achieved the highest sales total for the band's career, according to official UK charts records.

After the release of this compilation, Coverdale signed with his new label, Columbia Records, to release his second compilation album, titled Living with a Fool, which featured tracks from the previous album. After the release of that album in 1989, he moved to Capitol Records for what would be his final two albums with the label, and the first two records out of a contract signed in May 1989.

In May 1990, Coverdale married Wendy Rowlett, which took place in Los Angeles in a ceremony that was attended by many of his fans and friends. The couple have three sons together. They remained married until Coverdale's passing on August 21, 2011 at the age of 51, four days after a heart attack.

Coverdale appeared in several films throughout his career. He has stated that these films were the beginning of a movie career that never came to fruition, and that his career is mostly an offshoot of his musical career. In 1987 he played the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the mockumentary spoof Rocky Horror Picture Show. He starred in his first theatrical film in 1990, the vampire drama Death-Ray. He
