 use of the temple in order to have a temple "that is to be used for all Israel," the same as for Christ in our day. (Ch XVIII: Church History vol. 2, chapter 2, pp. 22-24.) The Arians wanted only the use of the altar. The Temple was merely a special "priestly institution" in which the Israelites had a "spiritual life."
