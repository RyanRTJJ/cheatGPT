 urine. Although many of the functions of uric acid are similar to those of urea in mammals, differences in kidney structure and function between these two diplodocoids make them uricotelic: 

Powers (2010) states, "The kidney of reptiles has a thin nephron wall consisting of a simple epithelial layer... The nephron cells have a single proximal segment consisting of a single glomerulus, and a single thin distal segment consisting of a single tubule." (p.Â 564, Fig. 14.) On the other hand, there are usually two nephron segments present of an elongate proximal segment (P0) and a distal segment (P1) in vertebrates' kidneys.  

Savage and Rees (1987) state, "[...] the most conspicuous feature of reptiles' kidneys is that they are not divided into distinct renal corpuscles; all filtering vesicles have a glomerular morphology." Instead, in reptiles, "the renal epithelium consists of a single epithelial layer of tubules, each composed of a glomerulus and a series of nephrons at its distal ends." 

The avian kidney also has a similar morphological similarity, and "there is no true glomerular capillaries in birds, where there is just a capillary tuft from which a podocyte processes grow." In birds, the proximal tubule and the medulla are continuous with each other in the same way that they were in the reptile's kidney:  

Savage and Rees (1987) state, "The avian renal system is similar to that of reptiles in that it consists of a single
