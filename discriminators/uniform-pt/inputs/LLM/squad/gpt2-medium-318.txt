 to influence the Armenian population and to dominate Armenia. In the same way, various European and Muslim ethnic groups, as well as a substantial number of Armenians in Turkey became Muslims during this period.

This pattern of history has led to three main groups. First, in the nineteenth and twentieth century, it became more and more difficult for the Armenian diaspora of Europe and North America to adjust to the Ottoman rule and Islam; the Armenian Orthodox Church was attacked within the last few years by radical Islamic elements and by the Ottoman government, especially during the 1920s and 1930s. Second, many refugees and refugees of the Turkish state took advantage of this political situation as a means of making a good living in the refugee camps. Third, and perhaps most importantly, today many millions of Armenians, at the mercy of both internal and external traumas have no voice in the political system in Armenia. This is particularly the case for the Armenian Democratic Party.

How did the genocide unfold?

The genocide of 1915 did not occur on Armenian soil, but rather on the Turkish-controlled territory of Anatolia. In the following two sections we will explain the nature of the events.

Introduction

Although it was initially assumed by the Armenians and other minorities of the north Caucasus to have been carried out by Turkish Ottoman soldiers or traitors, it became clear that the killing of certain tribes was a deliberate decision of the Turkish leadership and that a significant section of the Armenians were present during the genocide. In the period before 1915, the Ottoman government and its allies committed serious massacres, mostly against the Kurdish population. According to contemporary accounts, about ten thousand people were massacred between April 1915 and January 1918â€”in some cases, over three million people were massacred, according to estimates.

With the rise of fascist Turkey, many of
