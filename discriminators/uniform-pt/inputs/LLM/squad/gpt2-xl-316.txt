oths can detect vibrations. Other insects can detect the magnetic properties of metal objects.

Some species of insects also possess senses that assist them in sensing where they are in the world and even their position within it. These sense organs have been known for thousands of years. Some of the senses may not be found in all species of insect.

There are the first known insects with a pair of eyes. Scientists are still discovering what these eyes and how they work. Some have said the reason insects with eyes didn't become extinct is because they are a useful tool for many things in nature.

Insects may be the only animals with eyes that are able to detect magnetic fields in the earth. It is not known if these insect have special magnetic proteins or if their sense of magnetic waves exists on a different wavelength.

Insects have been known to have hearing, and it's not clear how they can see, smell, or taste due to the insects being unable to move their head or ears. But it is known that they can detect vibrations in the air.

A pair of eyes has been called a "lung." For all known insects, the eye is a place called the cochlea. When a bug perceives its environment it sends signals to the back of the brain, from which the brain sends signals to the antenna. When the insect moves its
