 north-south route in the south and west of the country and the A1 motorway and main north-south thoroughfare. Motorways in other European countries, such as France, have since followed suit, such as the A60. By the 1950s, the motorway network in the Land was very extensive and traffic was increasing rapidly. In 1958 and 1959, the first highway extensions were opened in the northwest and west, respectively. At the same time, the A4 was extended to the west, followed several years later by the A3 northward and the A3W to the east, along the previously mentioned motorway network. In all, from the 1950s to the 1970s, there were nearly 200 highway kilometres added to the Landwide network on both ends and most of it was motorway.

In the 1970s, the network development slowed significantly, resulting in some motorways being duplicated. The main projects were the A10 motorway extending from Hannover to Darmstadt, the bypass of Heidemarkt-Reichenau in order to relieve traffic congestion, the bypass of Neubiberg in order to relieve traffic congestion in Hesse, and the A6 motorway that runs from Schöningen (Westphalia) to Koln in order to bypass Frankfurt (Oder) Airport. In the 2000s, a new project for the A3 south east from Hanover to the city of Osnabrück was approved and work on a new motorway route started in the same year.

In the 2000s, further extensions of motorways within the Land were approved and works on the A3 south east were launched in 2004.
