, Maine, Normandy, Brittany, and Aquitaineâ€”but most of his power rested in his control of London. The king had taken a succession of lovers and in 1159 married his second wife, Berengaria of Navarre, in an effort to gain additional lands and political strength by strengthening his ties with the great noble families in the West. In Eleanor's youth she had been betrothed to Louis VII of France, but they were in conflict over the succession to the Byzantine Empire and were also deeply in love with each other. John's father sought to have the relationship finalized and in February 1164 married Eleanor to Louis's younger brother, the weak-willed Philippe Auguste. The union caused widespread hostility among the barons, who resented the loss of their liberties in favor of an Angevin regime. Nonetheless the young couple enjoyed a warm welcome in Paris and, later in 1165, at the wedding of their nephew King Louis, took oaths of homage to their father-in-law and to his regent, Queen Blanche of Castile. The marriage ended Eleanor's affair with Louis and her hope of gaining the Byzantine throne.

Upon hearing his half sister's good news, King Henry II rushed to Normandy in July 1166 and, in the course of several meetings, reached an agreement to make William of Normandy and Eleanor's son and namesake, born the previous January, heir to the English crown. At the same time he insisted that William give up the lands that his father-in-law had provided him in return for the crown of England. William readily surrendered his French territory, but he continued to claim the duchy of Normandy.
