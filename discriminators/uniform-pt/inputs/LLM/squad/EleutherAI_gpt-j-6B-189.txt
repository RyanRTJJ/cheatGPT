 highest population of Asian Americans, numbering 4.3 millionâ€”a population that's greater than San Francisco and Los Angeles combined.

The Asian American Population

For the second time we examine the characteristics of the Asian American population in New York City. Once again the numbers are larger than the combined populations of San Francisco and Los Angeles. While the population of Asian Americans in the Los Angeles-Long Beach metropolitan area numbers 2.1 million, in New York the total is more than 4.3 million. While these figures are similar to the 4.6 million Asian Americans in the San Francisco Bay Area, they're still a very significant presence and demonstrate that Asian Americans are a dynamic and vibrant segment of the New York urban population.

As we reported in our last post, the Asian American population in New York City shows strong trends. Between 2000 and 2010 the New York City Asian American population soared in numbers, with growth in each successive decade. In the first decade of the twenty-first century the Asian American population grew by more than 60 percent, to 1 million, and we can expect continued growth for at least the next decade.

According to the 2010 Census, 4.3 million people identify themselves as Asian, greater than the combined numbers of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Most notably, more New Yorkers identify themselves as Asian than identify themselves as whites or blacks.

Here are the estimated numbers of New York's Asian population:

Indian: 1.2 million

Chinese: 1.1 million

Korean: 400,000

Japanese: 410,000

Philippines: 380,000

Vietnamese: 200,000

Taiwanese: 110,000

Filipino: 110,000

Haitian: 100,000

Thai: 90,000

Laotian: 90,000

Indonesian: 80,000

Bangladeshi: 70,000

Nepalese: 70,000

Vietnamese: 50,000

Malaysian: 50,000

Other Asian: 1 million

One important point to make is that the numbers are not the result
