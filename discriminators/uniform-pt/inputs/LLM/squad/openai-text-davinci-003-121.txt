 and an estimated more ancient origin is possible. Copper has been mined for use as coins, ornaments, and utensils since pre-historic times. The richest source of the metal was found in the region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers which made up the ancient civilizations of Akkad, Sumer, Assyria and Babylonia, in what is now present day Iraq. In the Mediterranean, the island of Cyprus was a major source of copper and the Egyptians and Sumerian people used copper to make various tools and ornaments. Copper was also widely available in Europe, where it was used to make weapons and tools, as well as being sculpted into decorative pieces. Copper tubing was used by the ancient Romans for plumbing, and copper roofing and copper vessels were also used in their architectural designs.

Through the years, copper has been used in multiple industries. The Etruscans and Ancient Romans produced swords and shields with copper, which is still used today in many industries, including electronics, telecommunications, aerospace and construction. Copper is also essential to many alloys, such as brass and bronze, and is used in the production of coins and jewelry. It is also an important component of plumbing and electrified wiring due to its excellent conductive properties. 

In modern times, copper is used in a variety of applications. It is an essential element in producing renewable energy as it is used in solar panels and wind turbines. Copper wires also provide the connection for the power and data lines in homes, buildings, and machinery. Copper is also widely used in the electrical industry and can be found in most consumer electronics such as computers, tablets and televisions.
