gimon Xros Wars (or Digimon Fusion in the North American adaptation). It aired in Japan from July 6, 2010 to March 21, 2012 and featured seventy-eight episodes.

The series follows Mikey Kudo, a human boy who is the leader of the Fusion Fighters, a group of Digimon who are on a quest to save the Digital World from the evil forces of Bagra Army. Mikey is aided in his adventures by his Digimon partners Shoutmon, Ballistomon, and Dorulumon and a mysterious figure known as Nene Amano.

The battles in the series focus on a system called Xros Loader that allows Digimon to "fuse" or combine their forms through the process of DigiFuse. The Fusion Fighters often use this ability in order to fight against the Bagra Army. DigiFuse is also used to Form Change, granting Digimon Massive strength and enhanced capabilities.

In the North American adaptation, Mikey is accompanied by the human kids Rika, Zenjiro, and Christopher and the Digimon Cutemon, Knightmon, and Sparrowmon as they continue their adventures in the Digital World as the Fusion Fighters.
