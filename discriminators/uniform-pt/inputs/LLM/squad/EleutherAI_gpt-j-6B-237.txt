 could generate a series of small electric pulses[@b1]. This discovery was shortly after made public in a pamphlet titled *Principes d'Électricité*[@b2] along with some illustrations, which show the generation of three rotating magnetic pulses from an ailing electromagnet and a simple generator, called the oscillating armature (see [Fig. 1](#f1){ref-type="fig"}). The idea of this invention was later used by Benjamin Franklin, the famous founding father of electricity, in his first electrical experiments with the invention of the lightning rod to prevent the sparks from his kite from starting a terrible fire[@b3].

But this wasn't the first time that magnetic fields were observed to rotate. Over two centuries earlier, Kepler had witnessed the rotation of the planet Jupiter when viewing it through his telescope[@b4]. Now, over 240 years later, Galileo has discovered the rotation of our own planet, the sun, and now the possibility that it may rotate in the opposite direction as the planet Mars[@b5][@b6][@b7][@b8][@b9][@b10][@b11].

When he was a young assistant astronomer at the Santa Maria-Observatorio del Cielo in Rome (Italy) in the early 1630s, Galileo Galilei observed and measured many interesting aspects of the Sun's rotation when viewing it through a small telescope he had had installed at the observatory[@b7][@b8][@b9][@b10]. At about 3:15 am on October 22^nd^ 1616, he observed the Moon as it passed through the Sun's shadow as they appeared alternately along its diameter. According to these observations, the Moon moved very slowly during a few seconds while it occupied the center of the Sun's shadow, and then moved with great speed (almost twice that of the Moon's orbital speed) while it left the Sun's shadow moving towards the east, where it was blocked by the Earth. By the end of the observed time, the moon had made its final exit from the Sun's shadow, moving north at high speed (just below the orbit of Saturn) whilst the Sun travelled southward, moving
