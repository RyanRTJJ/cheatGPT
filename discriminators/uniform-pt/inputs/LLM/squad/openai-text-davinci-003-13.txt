 the U.S. Constitution. Strict separation of powers, in the traditional sense, is not part of the British political and constitutional tradition. The UK has a "mixed" or "fusion" of powers, whereby government is composed of the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary, but the three branches share certain powers and abilities.

The executive has the right to propose and enact legislation, create and regulate government agencies, and issue executive orders. The legislative has the right to propose, amend, and eventually pass laws. The judiciary enforces the laws passed, as well as presides over trials over those accused of breaking them. However, the branches also periodically work together and share certain powers, including the expenditure of funds and appointment of government officials, both of which must be approved by Parliament.

The UK's political structure is based on the principle of Parliamentary sovereignty, which precludes any convention of the separation of powers in its traditional sense. While the UK does not subscribe to the concept of a separation of powers in the context of the US Constitution, it does guarantee a strict separation of powers between the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary in accordance with the rule of law. This belief has been firmly upheld and developed over centuries, and is fundamental to the British parliamentary democracy and constitutionalism.
