However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which then gets up and grabs for another, or even for its owner.

No it's quite clear to me that the answer, though it may vary from experiment to experiment, is always the same, namely that the "mechanistic" cause and the "chemical" effect are separate and are governed by different mechanisms.

Yes, you said it. I am not so sure I would say "non-arbitrary" though. If I say I don't experience asymmetry in causal chains even though it seems obvious, then I'm saying that the difference between the two possibilities is what I would call arbitrary in nature.
