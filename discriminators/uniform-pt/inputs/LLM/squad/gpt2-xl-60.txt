 to be less responsive to some antigens than older infants and children. This is because many adults are exposed to allergenic foods and drugs at a young age, whereas babies and children are born very young, and are thus dependent on their mother/caregiver for nutritional needs. Mothers are also less likely to react to the same antigen in two babies in succession, because some antigens cannot enter the blood stream. However, some children do have an increased sensitivity to certain antigens, due to both genetic and environmental factors. It may be possible that the children who become allergic to chicken, for example, developed this sensitivity later in life, although studies of such children have not been published to our knowledge. Infants may also have an increased sensitivity to certain allergens once they reach school age. In fact, it is estimated that 10 to 20% of school children have a sensitivity to at least one food antigens.

Prenatal development of allergic reactions The developmental course of allergic reactions to allergens is well explained by the concept of 'latent sensitization'. This refers to the period before an individual develops a specific allergy, and occurs sometime before the age of five (or seven depending on the antigen being studied). The term 'latent' is important because all babies become sensitized to allergenic foods at some point during development. However, unlike babies, they tend not
