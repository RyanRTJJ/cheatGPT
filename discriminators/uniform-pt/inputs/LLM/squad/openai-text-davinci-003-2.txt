 had been sponsoring terrorist activities and was in possession of weapons of mass destruction.

The Bush administration argued that a preemptive invasion of Iraq would bring stability to the region, eliminate the threat posed by Saddam's regime, and pave the way for the establishment of a democracy in Iraq. Other U.S. allies, such as the UK, were persuaded by the US case, and approved the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

The invasion of Iraq was highly controversial, both domestically and internationally. Critics of the policy argued that the stated reasons for invasion were not valid, that it increased instability in the region and damaged US credibility, and that it was a distraction from the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan. They further argued that the war lacked a clear legal justification and potentially contravened international law, due to the lack of approval from the United Nations Security Council.

Despite these criticisms, the Bush administration was successful in obtaining approval from the US Congress and public opinion was divided. The invasion of Iraq resulted in the overthrow of Saddam's regime and the establishment of a democratic government, although it also resulted in a lengthy occupation, continuing sectarian violence, and a deepening civil conflict in the country. In 2020, the war in Iraq is still ongoing, although the threat posed by Saddam has been eliminated.
