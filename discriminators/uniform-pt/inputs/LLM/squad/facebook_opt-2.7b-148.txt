 has always been defined by its academic achievements, as exemplified by the high standards of education of the Jewish educational system.

Some of the main issues concerning educational achievements are:

The quality of schools is in decline in Israel according to several studies conducted in 2007 which indicates that the country's K-12 schools rank at the bottom in the world in academic achievements for mathematics and science combined, among other subjects. The country's best schools are distinguished and the country suffers from shortages of teachers and a decreasing number of students.

Education in Israel emphasizes a "liberal" approach towards religion and a "secular" approach towards the human rights and well being of its children.

The Israeli education system also focuses on the belief in a separation of religion and state in public education and encourages religious students to study separately or not to participate in compulsory secular schools.

In Israel, religion has become an important part of the public discussion and discourse; it is not a taboo since the founding of the State of Israel and has gained an important space in society, influencing many aspects of public policy and in the public sphere.

One the other hand, school funding is low and the quality of education offered to the most disadvantaged students is not being significantly improved.

Israel's education system is highly valued for its high levels of achievement and standards however it has long been recognized as being problematic and one of the main issues that is identified with the Israeli education system is the lack of adequate resources.

Education in Israel is highly valued in the national and cultural ethos.
