 capital of the Song Dynasty (960 - 122 B.C.).

Nanjing was one of China's major military points in the imperial era, and many monuments and historical sites associated with the city are located throughout the city. The city itself was built upon a site of ancient mud-brick fortifications that were erected along the river in the fourth century B.C., under the direction of T'ang Hsiao. The riverbanks, which began to be developed around the first century B.C., formed the original basis of the ancient city. Although the city was originally named "Ch'ang YÃ¼eh-Chu," which means "Little River City," by the imperial court, the name Nannan was adopted by the Chinese people to reflect its original name, which referred to the river water.
