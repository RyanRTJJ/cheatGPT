Also, Umar ibn al-Khattab was a prominent figure in Muslim History and should have been invited. Umar ibn Abu-Ubayta was Umar ibn Abu-Aufaanaah's uncle. He was also a prominent figure in history in Khurasan and had fought as a part of the Arab coalition against Byzantine forces in 613. Therefore it is very difficult to believe that he would not attend this feast. It would make sense, however, for any significant number of the Muslim leadership to attend, including the caliph.
