t of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The City of Melbourne has implemented a range of local initiatives to meet this objective, such as increased public transport services, a major switchover to solar-powered street lighting, and an urban forest program, which includes a drive to increase the trees in the city's parks and gardens. The City of Melbourne is also working to create a carbon-free economy, with more than one million tonnes of carbon dioxide being captured and prevented from entering the atmosphere through the use of energy efficiency and renewable energy measures. The City also participates in various international agreements and initiatives to reduce climate change impacts.

Moreland City Council has implemented an Energy Savers Action Plan to reduce the cityâ€™s emissions, particularly those from buildings and transport. This plan includes the use of renewable energy sources, the conversion of existing buildings to highly energy efficient retrofits, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles, and the promotion of sustainable transport. Additionally, the Council has been working with local businesses and industries to implement renewable energy projects, such as installing solar panels on public buildings, and providing advice on energy efficiency measures. The Council also offers eco-tourism certifications to businesses to encourage eco-friendly practices. Through these initiatives, Moreland City Council hopes to reduce its total carbon emissions and become carbon-neutral by 2050.
