 United States sought to protect their shipping interests in the Atlantic and their right to neutrality. America declared war with Britain in June of 1812, and for the next two years, the United States and Canada were at war. The conflict featured several major battles and skirmishes, most notably the Battle of New Orleans where a United States force led by General Andrew Jackson defeated a large British force in January of 1815. The conflict ended with the Treaty of Ghent in December of that year, and with both Britain and the United States recognizing each other's claims in the Atlantic.
