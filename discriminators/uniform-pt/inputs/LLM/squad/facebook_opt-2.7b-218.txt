 of the 12th century. The Irish and Picts appear to have been closely related, as both are the only known Celtic people of Ireland, Scotland and Northern Britain who speak an isolate Celtic branch of their common language.

Early History of the Hibni People

The earliest written evidence for the Hibni people of Ireland dates back to c.800 BCE when the inhabitants occupied what is today called 'Connemara.' They were known as 'Liric or Corcuillann.' By 700 BCE they were known as 'Míri.' By early 536 BCE they were known as 'Snorri.' In the fifth century BCE they settled the island as 'Senlúd' or 'Liradach.'

The history of the Picts, who were descendants of the Liric people, is less well known. They seem to have settled in the eastern part of Ireland within the territory of the Corcuillans. According to the Annals of Ulster (721–691 BCE), the Corcuillans were overthrown in 725 BCE and replaced by a Pictish-speaking people, who came to be called 'Picti.' The later literature of the Ulster Cycle suggests that during the middle years of this period, the name of the early Pictish people was 'Iveraghni,' and that in some parts of North Britain, they were called 'Áiríghni,' indicating a Pictish-speaking population. We may be told more about the Pictish people after their removal from Ireland and their establishment in Pictish-speaking communities in Britain.

The earliest Irish names for the Picts are listed in the Annals of Ulster, with the earliest mention being c. 724 BCE when Strabo refers to
