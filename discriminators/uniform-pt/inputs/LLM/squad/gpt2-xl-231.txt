 west coast of modern-day England. In Norse mythology the invaders originated from a giant snake, the Fenrir (the German for "glutton").

The Norse language, which is still alive in all its original forms throughout Scandinavia and other parts of northern Europe, is the oldest surviving language in the world, and has a rich history that stretches over 1.8 billion years, although its history of occupation is only around 500,000 years.

Language family

Norse is a branch of West Germanic but is distinct from the West Germanic languages of eastern Germany's Lower Saxony, and even western Germany: Norse is a West Germanic language as opposed to the Germanic languages of eastern Germany, which are also West Germanic, but from the North Germanic branch of Germanic, which is an Indo-European (or Old English) language.

Although some West Germanic languages can be traced back to Proto-Indo-European (PIE), this is generally not the case with Nordic languages.

Norse was officially recognized as an independent language by the Danish National Language Board in 2001, making it the first Germanic country to do so. Danish has spoken the word "Norse" for the last 500 years, which also made it the first West Germanic country to do so.
