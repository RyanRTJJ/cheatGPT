In the end, it was Hillary Clinton that ended up holding on to Ohio:

The Clinton campaign, still smarting from what it perceived to be the Trump campaign's dirty tricks in a couple of critical swing states last week, has gone on the counterpunch, bringing to bear its arsenal of big-money Democratic donors.

The Clinton campaign released a scathing television ad last week that attacked Trump for lying about his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.

The campaign also plans to expand the ad out beyond the battleground states where it first appeared, including the battleground states that Trump carried.

And the campaign has set up an "Ohio Project," a war room on Monday dedicated to bringing tens of thousands of people onto the phone, email and social media to talk about why they will vote for the Democratic presidential candidate in November.

More to come, and a good read for the campaign.
