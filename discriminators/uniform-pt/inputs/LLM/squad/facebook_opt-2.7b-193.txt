 grows, their interactions with friends and peers change; they interact in different ways and with different expectations; there may be a change in the nature of their social interactions. As their social circle continues to diversify, it may become more focused on friendship relationships, or the interaction between two individuals may become more flirtatious. Adolescents may experience a social identity crisis at this time, as they attempt to figure out who they are and what direction they want to take their life. They are interested in developing romantic relationships as well, and have trouble discerning whether one relationship is sexual or platonic. By learning more about how individuals engage in social interactions that may or may not involve sexual or romantic orientation, teachers, parents, and students can make better informed decisions about the health and social development needs of adolescents with a sexual orientation or gender identity opposite to their own.

This project focuses on the relationships adolescents have with friends (specifically those who are gay, lesbian, or bisexual) and their family members. We study how gay teenagers interact with their friends, parents, and partners, and how gay families interact with each other. We focus on the relationships that adolescents have with their parents and family members because we believe the relationships between these social circles play a vital role in adolescents' social development. It is difficult to determine how a child's relationship with one parent or family member affects the relationship between them and their other family members. In addition to the role parents and relationships play in adolescents' social lives, the nature of the relationship that they have with adolescents is also difficult to assess. By studying various kinds of relationships between adolescents and members of their social spheres, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the social behaviors and beliefs of the adolescents in question.
