also be seen as the catalysts for social, economic, and political change. In the centuries following the fall of the Roman Empire, the political structure in Europe would become decentralised and fragmented.

In the wake of the Roman collapse, barbarian tribes moved into the Italian peninsula and across Europe. Barbarian tribes, such as the Visigoths, Vandals, Franks and Ostrogoths, moved into the region and established their own kingdoms. These kingdoms became centres of power and authority as they broke away from the weakened Roman Empire.

The political structure in Western Europe also changed as the Holy Roman Empire arose in the medieval period. The Holy Roman Empire, an evolution of the original Carolingian Empire, was particularly significant in the creation of Europeâ€™s political structure. The emperor was elected by a council of Princes and was usually of the German territories. The empire had an uneven distribution of power, as the emperor and several princes had legal authority over the lands and people within their particular domains in the empire.

The political structure of Europe was also significantly altered by the development of the nation-state system. Monarchs enthroned in European countries from the 15th to 18th centuries were become increasingly powerful and this period marked a transition from a decentralized feudal system to a centralised nation-state. This period saw a large-scale consolidation of power, as European countries such as Spain, France and England began to develop more unified and independent nation-states. The Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 is often seen as symbolizing the end of the feudal system
