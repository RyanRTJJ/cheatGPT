 measured by the Human Development Index, and how these errors can systematically bias the reported findings. They also give a short summary of how these data are affected by the Gini coefficient and discuss how this affects the HDI.

The index is a composite measure of life expectancy, educational attainment, and per capita income or consumption. The index can be calculated both on individual and aggregate levels.

I want to discuss the limitations of the HDI and the underlying datasets.

This might explain why the
