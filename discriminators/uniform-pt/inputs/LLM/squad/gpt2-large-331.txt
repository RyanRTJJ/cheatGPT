 a huge push from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) in 1889 to protect the life of the farm animals from the dangers of the light bulb.

For the first time, farm animals could be kept outdoors (there was no need to have a large, chimney-like building for the indoor facilities). The use of a modern building with glass as a window pane meant that animals could see more clearly and were safer on the water. The building also removed the need to build artificial lagoons or ponds in which to keep them. The farm animals were kept on large, open farm floors covered in a thick plaster-coated carpet.

Easter Egg – Swan's Planting and Harvesting of Eggs

There are a number of Easter eggs at the Swan farm – a very interesting addition not least because these are also where the chickens are laid and raised. Many of the eggs are used to make the "seed of love" cookies that the people visit.

Also in the shed and garden is a large pond for water collecting. There is also an artificial pond (for keeping the ducks), the main pond for holding a large flock of birds, a tank with a shallow pool for catteries, a large room for making toys, and a large room for holding eggs that have been bought from a local dealer. All of this will be on display when the farm reopens.
