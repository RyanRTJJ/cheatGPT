 of the disease or to improve the management of the diseased condition."

The report notes that there is not a single study that has established who received the first viral infection or who was infected with that first agent. However, it notes that "all of our findings support the view that viral transmission of the influenza virus during human or animal-to-human interactions may occur through close contact between persons with the same infection and susceptible hosts or between susceptible persons exposed to either viral or bacterial agents."

But there's a lot more to the study than that. It identifies the four people who are most likely to develop the infection: the family members of those with the most previous infections who were also infected, those at the highest or lowest risk of having had an oral vaccine for the virus, those diagnosed with a coagulopathic condition whose clinical manifestations are influenza within the first 7 days after vaccination, older than 18 years of age and a family member who is living in Asia or who is infected by another carrier virus.

The study reports that of the six individuals who were diagnosed at or within 7 days of a vaccination, 15 (37%) contracted the first influenza infection but did not get the disease.

Two had severe oral vaccination challenges. Among them were four adults (4%) whose immune systems had been compromised after an acute respiratory infection; one adult (1%) who was a child with a co-morbid infection with pertussis,
