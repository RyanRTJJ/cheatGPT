 bilingualism was the hallmark of Yugoslavia, which was, more than any other, founded on the concept that the state lacked the resources and resources of other nations. In the case of Slovenia, for instance, "the system was clearly broken: the state was overwhelmed with new immigrants as well as new languages," explained an academic who worked on the project. Croatia "had never given up on the idea of changing national borders," explained the Slovenian civil affairs judge. "The Yugoslav state had adopted an official bilingualism system in the first two years of the period. When the situation fell apart and Slovenia did not have a policy for foreign speakers, it worked perfectly."

Accordingly, Croatian officials began to discuss the Slovenians with Slovenian officials in early 1999. The decision to take Slovenia out of the "Treaty on Refugees", which was the centerpiece of the 1995 resolution, drew attention from other countries: Hungary, Austria, Cyprus, Greece, France, Italy, Lithuania, Italy, Malta, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Slovenia, and Germany. The decision was quickly followed by a referendum on Slovenia as the new nation, in 2010, after the country refused to accept 200,000 refugees.

At times during the war, the Slovenians were asked to "change" their language or national language. For instance: when a government policy on foreign students refused to allow Croatian citizens entry into Slovenia, the President Serzh Sargsyan stated, "I don't want to take that opportunity in order to change our language. I would just like to have the country more open to foreigners."

In February 1998, Yugoslavia's High Court ruled that Croatian citizens cannot be deported at all from the Yugoslav Republic unless their nationality was changed
