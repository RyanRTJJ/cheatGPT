iation of past discrimination that benefits minorities today, and diversity that enhances the overall quality of American life and provides a variety of positive benefits to minority and non-minority groups alike". He explains in this quote, "There is a significant amount of literature on affirmative action that has nothing to do with racial inequalities".

"In fact, one could argue strongly that affirmative-action remedies disproportionately benefit disadvantaged non-minorities because they target their own groups for affirmative treatment rather than the minority group on the basis of discrimination."

He further supports his case while giving an example of how affirmative action is practiced in today's America:

There are at least forty states in the U.S. that have implemented affirmative action in higher education since 1978. Even the federal government under the Bush administration, which officially opposed any program that used race as a factor, implemented an affirmative action program for education in 2008 that is the same program that existed under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s. This program, the Obama Administration's own Affirmative Action Guidance, provides incentives to colleges that enroll high percentages of low-income and first-generation students of color. The program has the same aim that affirmative-action advocates of the past have fought for: to provide minority and women students with an educational boost by giving them the same educational opportunities and rewards that would have come to students who were not discriminated against
