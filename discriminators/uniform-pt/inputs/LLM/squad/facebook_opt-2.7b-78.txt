 in any way compared to iOS's has never been clear to me. It's been interesting to watch the iPhone's success over the last two and a half years, though. That's become the dominant platform for Apple â€” by far the most important, I'd say, even though its share has declined since early 2010, according to a new study. More than half of Apple's OS X users now run iOS, and OS X is even less popular with PC users than it is with Mac users.

If I could, I'd move the Mac to the cloud so I wouldn't spend time worrying about it, but we're not quite there yet. It does seem, however, that the Mac's share of operating systems is slipping away faster than Apple thought.
