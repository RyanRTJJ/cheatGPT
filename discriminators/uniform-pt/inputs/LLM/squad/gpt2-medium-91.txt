 their energies. Feynman's remarkable power over the mathematical description of nature led to the development of modern physics that would enable us to use atomic and molecular physics with the utmost reliability to prove that everything we believed to be true of physical laws of nature—the laws that govern energy, mass and momentum, or the laws governing particle motion—were wrong.

And it wasn't just Einstein who was trying to disprove Feynman's model. At the same time, it was in great crisis for many physicists. The famous General Relativity was in doubt. The idea was that gravity had no place in the world's biggest, oldest and most mysterious machine. The discovery of a mysterious "ghost" of the early universe had been made; it seemed to confirm that all matter was gravitationally bound, which would mean that gravity couldn't explain what we see around us. Moreover, a recent paper by physicists from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, showed that gravitational waves, thought to have come from an unknown source behind us, could only have come from a nearby black hole with a larger mass than our own Milky Way. Now, with such convincing evidence against Gravitational Waves, they were forced to consider leaving their cosmology in place, although they would maintain that dark matter is a distinct possibility. (Gravitational field theory is a branch of physics that, like the standard model, makes the existence of dark matter and dark energy a central idea and part of cosmology.)
