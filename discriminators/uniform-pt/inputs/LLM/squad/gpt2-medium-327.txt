 these texts—that includes a large number of African-American authors—came later. For contemporary scholars of cultural studies, there are at least two problems with the authors' model: first, it is false. The texts of culture studies do often look like texts of American political science—both implicitly and explicitly—while implicitly and explicitly they do show that in the United States racialism was a significant part of democratic life and that whites dominated the Democratic Party for most of the twentieth century. The evidence is overwhelming that racial politics was a pervasive influence on American society and democracy throughout the twentieth century.

Two of the major academic works that are critical of cultural studies do find some indication of racial politics. In the book The End of White Nationalism: America in the 1950s and the End of the Second Empire, David Graeber argues that racism was the dominant culture-building ideology in the US from the 1930s through the 1950s. In the 1960s, however, it turned against itself, which in practice meant that the culture of racial and ethnic resentment developed into a toxic brand of white manhood the likes of which the US had never seen. There are clear parallels between the cultural historian John C. Loftus' assessment of the 1960s and the analysis of the authors of Martin's article. Both argue that racial politics was a core element of contemporary U.S. politics, and both point to the 1960s as a crucial juncture in the rise of racial politics as a mainstream political message.

Martin and his co-authors also take a different approach than Loftus and Graeber: to what extent did political rhetoric within the national culture of white nationalism and the white supremacy
