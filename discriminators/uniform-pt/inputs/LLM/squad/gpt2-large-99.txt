 the Classic Set.

The Deluxe set was produced by Taito, who used their standard SCE trademark font for the packaging (see the image below). The Control Deck and Action Set came in smaller-format forms, were produced by the Bandai Namco subsidiary Namco (Namco's sister company) and were printed at the same time as the Deluxe Set by a third print run. The Classic Set (pictured below) was produced by Sega and was not included in the control deck bundle. The two sets of the game were available in different coloured boxes and the Classic Set was available in a black or white version.

With the release of the 3DS in North America on 27th July 2012, the 3DS included the standard GameBoy S controller in a black or white colour scheme. The 3DS was not as popular in Europe, with the system arriving after its release in Europe (see Europe below).
