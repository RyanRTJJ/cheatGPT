, tar, and pitch, was used in Greece for roofing. In 1877, a German researcher also found a paper describing a recipe for pissasphalto still available in Greece, and noted that pissasphalto roofing in Spain still had strong ties to Greek colonies in that country. The name of the process was also called boulisne. In 1887, the term pissasphalto was already used in the trade as the name of a waterproof paint, and in 1900, an American manufacturer introduced boulisne roofing that was not waterproof but lasted 10 years, and by the 1920s, there were over 1,000 manufacturers of boulisne.
It has long been known that the manufacture of waterproof paints can be an extremely laborious process, especially since the material usually has to be melted and poured into form. Therefore, in the traditional method, there was not necessarily enough time to melt the material, to pour it into form and to apply at least a first layer of a waterproof paint. It has now been known for several years to have a so-called “liquid lay-up” principle by way of which the waterproof paint can be manufactured in two steps. In accordance with the principle, one melts waterproof paint into a form in a furnace or in a reactor to which the material is already prepared in a form, for instance, in the form of flakes, pellets, balls or tablets. Then the melted material can be poured at different times into a first bath of a liquid for application. The layers are subsequently joined by heating to produce an adhesive layer, that can then be put into form
