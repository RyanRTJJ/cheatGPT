, they can be exposed to cultural and social norms in an appropriate and effective way. This ability to self-actualize is the basis for their successful participation in school activities, and this engagement can help build social competence as well as economic and academic success. For example, research found youth who performed at high levels in the activities and achievements, educational standards, and civic engagement were less likely to become depressed or socially isolated as adults.[10]

Efforts to help youth achieve this social competence are needed. For these purposes, we conducted the following study to understand differences in risk factors between adolescents and other youths in the United States. We examined longitudinal trends in mental Health service use among adolescents and nonenrolled adults and what educational outcomes were associated with the same mental health service use among adolescents and nonenrolled adults.

Methods Study

Data and Findings

The data from this sample are from the Longitudinal Health Insurance for Adolescent and Adults sample, which was a nationally representative sample of American youths ages 16–19, aged 2–17 at random during the 1996–1997 and 2001–2002 surveys. The sample included 3,092 participants, of whom 1,003 were selected randomly. This sample was also a nationally representative sample of 18–21 year-olds, aged 21–24. The sample included 1,937 participants with a mean age of 16.5.[11] The estimated rate of unemployment for nonenrolled Americans during these years is approximately one percent.[12]

For the data presented here, we used the latest methodology for use with the US Population Estimates, which include information on selected years (1987–1995). To reduce the probability of any bias that would result from the use of data from an earlier time date, we employed a more conservative estimation method known as "standard error-specific," or "SES" for short, in which a set of numbers (e.g., years of schooling) are assigned to a specific population using a fixed margin of
