 but the chemical composition of copper was not discovered until 1729.

Before the development of modern chemistry, copper was known to have medicinal properties. Today we use copper in such things as plumbing, refrigerators and air conditioners (due to the development of the American electric grid in the early 20th century), appliances and electrical wire (and even wiring in the air of airplanes), and jewelry.

Copper is known to have amazing health promoting properties for human and animal health. Most copper products are now treated with copper solutions to help maintain that health promoting properties, but what does that mean biologically?

The biochemist J.H. Laidler studied copper in animals and found that trace amounts had been given to all animals studied. Laidler found that copper was required to protect animals from disease in small quantities. Laidler called the function of trace amounts, “biological protection.” He hypothesized that copper acted to control infections and that excess copper was toxic. Later studies have discovered more evidence to support Laidlers hypothesis. This article will discuss copper on a biological level.

The main function of copper is to allow cells to receive electrons. That is what a redox reaction is. (Redox is another name for what bio chemists call electron transfer — see the article below on the topic).

Copper is necessary to allow animal cells to receive electrons — not just human cells. Animal cells do not have a protective barrier like human cells, so the only way to receive electrons is to be exposed to the outside. Since copper is not toxic to animal cells, we could be exposed to high doses of copper, and since it would not be toxic, there
