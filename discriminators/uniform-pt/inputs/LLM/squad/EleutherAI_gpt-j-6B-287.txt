 and prestige of the western church by emphasising the spiritual and liturgical achievements of the early Christian church. Its main theme was the depiction of the passion and crucifixion of Jesus. Although the central theme was still the life and ministry of Jesus, the artists of Carolingian art were more concerned with the theological importance of his death than with his life and ministry. In some works, the emphasis may be that of the triumph of good over evil, but not for the Carolingian art of this period. A clear sign of the increasing importance of the Eucharist was the fact that scenes of it predominated in the art of this period, as it could be traced from the earliest Anglo-Saxon art of the 7th and 8th centuries, through the Early English and Romanesque, and on into Gothic art. The later French art of the 11th century developed both in the monastic context and in larger secular church buildings. Many later churches that incorporated earlier Norman architecture incorporated much of the art styles of the period, thus blending them into a new artistic style. This artistic transition was well represented in the Sainte-Chapelle, which combines Romanesque and Gothic features.

After the end of the Carolingian Empire and at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, the art continued to evolve with the Norman tradition developing in the hands of church-builders who took what was useful from earlier art and adapted it as best as they could.
