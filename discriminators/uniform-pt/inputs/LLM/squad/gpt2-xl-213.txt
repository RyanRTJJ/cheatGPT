 land and set about founding a colony similar to Jamestown in Virginia. In July of 1686, the first colonists reached Jamestown. The original plan called for two ships and sixty men. The first three ships, however, didn't arrive in time to begin work. The remaining twenty two arrived two months later. The remaining nine ships arrived in the spring of 1687. Four more ships arrived in the summer of 1687. Four more ships arrived in the fall of 1687. Two small ships did not arrive until mid-December 1687. These ships were originally supposed to reach Cape Hatteras in December 1688 and arrive there eight days later. But as the time dragged on, the first ship never arrived and the second one only arrived during the Christmas of 1689, more than two months later.

The colony flourished from then, beginning in June 1689. The colony flourished for more than a hundred years, even reaching the height of its glory on June 21, 1718. George Washington led his troops in a decisive victory against the American forces at Brandywine on June 21, 1718. With the success at Brandywine, Washington led the American forces in their triumphant victory over the British at Yorktown. On December 20, 1788, the British forces surrendered at Yorktown. With the victory at Yorktown, American troops established a temporary foothold in a foreign land. America was no longer a foreign country.
