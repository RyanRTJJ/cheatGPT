It is the only work produced by Duchamp, and he refers to it as 'A Cubist House,' although he has not identified the artist who created it.

Others had been constructed in Paris; in the north of France, such as the famous house designed by Paul Louis Auclers in Albi and at Versailles, Paris (now occupied by the Louvre Museum); as well as at Montpellier, Chantilly and Lyons. The Cubist House at Montmartre, however, is the only house ever built by Duchamp (a total of three projects were lost, the others being the
