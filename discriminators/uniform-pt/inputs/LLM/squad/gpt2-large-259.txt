 the first carbon capture and storage facility in the world at the former Maitland Park. Melbourne's City of Sunshine (Mons), in the inner-suburban west of Melbourne, achieved this goal by investing $60 million to build a carbon capture (CCS) facility in March 2004. This led to the capture of 829 tonnes of carbon dioxide, and the operation and transfer of this carbon from the ground to a liquid waste stream as CO 2. To date, the carbon-capture facility is open to the public and is under constant threat of further theft. Melbourne is one of a few cities with carbon storage that has made significant progress. In Sydney, a CCS facility has been operational since 2001 and is considered to be carbon neutral. The City of Brisbane has been a driving force in CCS, with an ongoing development of the carbon capture system and in August 2005 Queensland became Australia's first capital city to approve CCS permits for its new liquefied natural gas (LNG) power station. There are currently four CCS facilities in operation in Australia, including the largest plant in the world, the Burdekin Power Plant in Western Australia. In Europe alone, the continent is home to a host of CCS projects from Belgium to Sweden.

The City of Melbourne's CCS program comprises a carbon capture and storage (CCS) facility, a carbon offsetting facility, and the collection and processing of waste at its Maitland Park site before being transported to a state-owned landfill.

In 2002, the City of Melbourne received a $16 million federal grant for the operation and removal of the
