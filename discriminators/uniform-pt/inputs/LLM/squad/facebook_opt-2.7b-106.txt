When the Blores took over the running of the hotel in the 1890s they had no grand schemes for change, but the owners of the hotel decided it was time to move on. After years of neglect and little improvement the hotel finally closed in 1952. It was not until 1976 that a decision was made to demolish the hotel and start again. That work began in 1979.

In 1978 the hotel became the headquarters of the Blore Trust. One of its aims is "To preserve Blore's fine and historic buildings and to protect their heritage by raising funds to purchase and restore them to their original character and to ensure they remain open to the public."

The Blores' vision was for Blore to become "the centre of arts, culture and leisure in the whole of the West Midlands". This involved a range of buildings and areas, including the East Front (rebuilt by Webb), the Courtyard (which is now the Grand Ballroom, built in 1890), the former stables around the Courtyard, and the building in the grounds known as the Coach House.

Blore also hosted two films, the 1931 Alfred Hitchcock romantic drama An Evening With Love starring Barbara Stanwyck as Ruth Langdon and The Woman in Black, which was filmed in the courtyard and also features many of the same actors.

Between 1990 and 1999 the hotel was partly taken back to its original 18th-century style with the restoration and refurbishment of its courtyards and the
