Hunting Small Game Animals

There are quite a few wild game animals in Trinidad, mainly deer, wild goat, boar, squirrel, and even pheasants. In Trinidad, you can go hunting all year round. However, it is best and cheaper to do it in the season. The season for hunting deer starts in March, but the hunting season starts just before the first of the year. The Deer season lasts until the end of March.

The goat is hunted around mid-April and goes through to mid-October, and the boar and squirrel are hunted all year round. The squirrel can be hunted almost every day of the year except during Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Yearâ€™s Eve.

Pheasants are the only small wild game that is hunted all year round. The hunting season of pheasant starts in March and lasts until May and June. Pheasants are sometimes hunted for their meat, but they are really just a food for hunting dog.

The Game Hunting Laws, Regulations, and Licenses

There are certain game hunting laws, regulations, and license you must get in order to hunt. Deer hunting includes the need to get a license and get one of the types of licenses depending on whether you are legally allowed to do so, such as shooting, trap, sport archery, or trap and release. The trap and release license allows the hunter to trap and then release the animal, as long as the animal is not found to be diseased. Hunting with shotguns and rifles requires a hunter and a shotgun, and a rifle at least 25 gauge. This is to ensure that the pellets that exit the gun are less than 1.5 ounces, and to make sure the pellets fall within a legal range. Also, a gun must be equipped with an air choke tube and a choke that is compatible with the pellets, and that a bullet has been fitted as well.
