The vernacular languages of the Middle East have been very diverse. The most widespread dialects are Arabic (the standard language in the Gulf states and among the Berbers in Northwestern Africa) and Turkish (spoken primarily in the Anatolian region of Turkey).

The other common East Asian languages in use in these regions are Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.
