 40 hits; and Live and Let Die (1995), which reached the top 20. Another notable album, I Am a Rock Star, was released by the label in 1996 and again topped the pop charts including the Alternative Songs chart. Following the release of Get a Grip, Aerosmith returned for Live and Let Die, but with a different lineup and released I Am a Rock Star in 1999.

Since then, Aerosmith has continued to make great commercial hits such as I Am the Walrus (2005), which hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for a third consecutive week; Take Five (2011), which peaked at number one on the Hot 100 for a sixth consecutive week; the critically acclaimed In Utero (2015), which brought another Top Ten charting album, the No. 9 Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame induction of Aerosmith, in 2017; and All That Remains (2018), which reached the chart for the fourth consecutive year. With a new Aerosmith record every year, it is possible that the band will even consider a revival.

Since its inception in 1985, Aerosmith has had many talented singers, and each performer's contribution can be a part of Aerosmith's "greatest hits" of the discography. The success of the band over the past 40 years shows that it is possible to take inspiration from those greats and the greatest singles in order to create a new music career.
