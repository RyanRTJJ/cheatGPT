a dynasty of the North Indian state of Meghalaya, and the Srikarta Rajputana. The Gurjunas fought the powerful Malwa and Meghalaya dynasties that ruled much of India. However, the Srikarta dynasty had a monopoly over the north-east and its capital Kannur, near present-day Kochi. The Srikartas controlled the south, and their capital, Vijayanagar. The Gurjunas, on the other hand, established the largest empire in northern India from the 13th to the 16th century, and they also extended from the Ganges to the western Himalayas, which included present-day Tibet and Nepal.

From the 12th to the 15th century, the Srikarta Rajputana conquered much of northern India. However, the power vacuum created from the Gurjanas' defeat at the hands of these earlier rulers led to an explosion of violence in southern India, known as the Rajput Rebellion. After a two-year civil war with the Srikartas, the Rajputs seized over a third of the kingdoms. In the 18th century, the Gurjara Pratiharas, based in northern India, fought against the Srikartas, but were eventually defeated.

After the battle of Khargone, Rana Pratama in 1276 converted his kingdom into a Rashtrakuta Kingdom, which became Rajputana and extended south to modern-day Nepal and northern Tibet, while the Rajputana Kingdom was established in Malwa state (present-day Bihar). The Rajputs also expanded south from the Ganges to the Arabian Sea; for a time they had control of the coast of India.

The Gurjara Empire was brought down by invading armies of the Srikartas from the 13th
