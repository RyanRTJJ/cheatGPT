 a number of local kings of central Java to expand their empire into other areas beyond Java. In the 17th century, the emperor annexed the Central Java region to the Malya-Sarawak State and later the kingdom of Srivijaya to the Dutch East Indies when those kingdoms tried to establish their own independent state. In 16th century, the empire incorporated the Majapahit Empire and the kingdom of Majapahit (Indonesian: Majapahit). The empire was the largest sovereign state of the region for several decades until the 17th and 18th centuries. After the fall of the empire in 1644, the country passed into various hands for the next half century before the nation regained its independence in 1786 under the Dutch, later to become known as the Republic of Dutch East Indies in 1946 after a short occupation by the Dutch government and the Dutch East Indies Company, which succeeded from the Netherlands Indies Government in 1946.

The Javanese people were originally an Austronesian group whose homeland had been in west and central Java. However, after the emergence of Islam, Javanese began to incorporate into an independent nation, the Majapahit Empire and its predecessors. In the 12th century, Java was divided between two kingdoms, West Java and East Java, and later, Majapahit state. The Majapahit established a vast empire covering much of Southeast Asia during the 13th century, before falling under the Hindu, Javanese, and other kingdoms during the 16th century.

This led to the beginning of the foundation of the Javanese Empire. Later, the Majapahit Empire collapsed as Javanese spread from East Java to East Malaysia.
