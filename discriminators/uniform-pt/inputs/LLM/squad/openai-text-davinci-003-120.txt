ological processes. The brain must construct, store and maintain memories. While memories may be passed on genetically, this type of memory is stored as an innate behavior and is not a type of memory that can be consciously recalled.

The molecular basis of memory involves a complex network of molecular interactions that promote synaptic plasticity and the encoding of new information. This process is driven by changes in neural connectivity, which is the ability of a neuron to respond to and store new information through the strengthening or weakening of synaptic connections. These changes in connectivity are driven by the release of various neurotransmitters, including glutamate, dopamine and acetylcholine. The hippocampal dentate gyrus is known to play an important role in the storage of information.

Memory is also modulated by epigenetics, the regulation of gene expression that is not determined by changes to the DNA sequence, and neuroinflammation, the accumulation of immune responses to events in the brain.

Finally, the ability to recall memories is affected by the strength of the neuronal connections, which is determined by the amount of time devoted to reconsolidation activities. Memory reconsolidation helps strengthen memories over time and requires time and repetition. It is thought to involve a reactivation of the neuronal pathways associated with the memory as well as a strengthening of the synaptic connections. In this way, memories become more stable and easier to recall.
