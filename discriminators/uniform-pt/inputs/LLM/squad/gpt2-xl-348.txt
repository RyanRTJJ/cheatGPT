 and the Punjab in one state and ruled it for 30 years until their demise in 882. A short time later, the Marathas emerged as the great power of the South Indian kingdoms, dominating the region for the next two centuries. In 912, they were so successful that they attacked the Maratha Empire. In retaliation, a number of Maratha towns—Munirabad, Bijnore, Rajkot, and Ajmer—were burned down by the Maratha army. Even among the Marathas, their political organization was often a political rather than military unit. Indeed, the Marathas and the Mughals (Mughal Empire) were two distinct political entities, created by the British during their era of domination of the subcontinent.

Maratha History & Culture


A Maratha was a person with a noble lineage who was a warrior, an accomplished courtier, or was a businessman. While the word "man" encompasses every ethnic or cultural group in India, the Maratha people, collectively known as the Marathas, are also known as "Tajik Maratha," "Brahmin Maratha" or "Sassariya Maratha." Like some other Indian ethnic groups, they were a subaltern caste. They lived together in villages of the Punjab and Sindh provinces during the late 9th and 10th century.

They were the first to adopt Christianity as a faith and spread it throughout Sindh. Their long reign of conquest brought them the largest empire in the sub-continent at the time. The Maratha rulers were well versed in languages and literature as well as horsemanship. Like the Rajputs throughout the subcontinent, Marathas adopted Islam as their religion, and the name Dhul-Ka-Zar-i Sabzaf-i-Maratha was bestowed upon them upon the death of their ruler
