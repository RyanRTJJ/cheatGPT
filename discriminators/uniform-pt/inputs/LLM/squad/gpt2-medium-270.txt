When it comes to the UK, the first two or three hours of the journey may seem trivial - a ferry is on the way from Dublin to Belfast or Edinburgh - but for travellers, especially those living in low-lying areas, it is a terrifying place to visit on holiday - but once on, getting a lift up from Aberystwyth ferry to Belfast can be as difficult as navigating the city itself using a guidebook!

One of my favourite ways to find out what can happen during a trip to an area of low lying land is to use the Aberystwyth ferry, but don't forget to always check the forecast of your journey on your map because the weather can change very rapidly and the map might get very foggy.

Some people choose to choose to stay on the sea (most people go fishing on the islands and also get an adventure on a local pier for the night). The other people plan to stay out on the coastline and can't find enough people to take a ferry. I'll explain why later:

Stay with friends or family, especially those who own homes near islands and need close contact. To my left is my house; my mother lives just 2km from Aberystwyth and our sister lives just 2km further up the coast.

If you don't have friends close to Aberystwyth, contact friends and family near the islands to book them a ferry ride.
