 amongst Jews of all levels of national background. English is a unifying language, it is the language that is most commonly used in communication between Jews of all walks of life. In addition, English proficiency is increasingly becoming a necessary prerequisite for living and working in the diaspora, particularly for younger generations of Jews. With the establishment of Israel as a modern nation-state and the subsequent growth in the state of Israel's economic and political stature, there has also been an increased demand for Hebrew as a communicative language. To that end, many Jews have sought to revive the language and recognize it as a source of Jewish identity.

In spite of the various efforts, Hebrew is still not widely understood or spoken by Jews outside of the state of Israel. For Israelis living abroad, the use of English has become essential in order to communicate with members of the global Jewish community. Additionally, English has become a necessary language for navigating the business world, attending international conferences, and staying abreast of global developments in the tech industry. 

It is therefore clear that English is the language of Jewish unity. Despite the efforts to promote the usage of Hebrew, English still features prominently amongst the Jewish population. English has become a powerful tool for empowerment, liberation, and understanding. This is made especially evident by how English has acted as a bridge between different generations of Jews. In today's ever-changing environment, English is a necessary and invaluable tool for assuring the continuity of the Jewish way of life.
