 million individuals, almost half of the population aged 15 and older, were in elevator accidents. Elevators have a zero accident rate for almost every traffic scenario in urban areas. The safety record of elevators includes only 9,000 total elevator accidents, which is the lowest rates in the country. This does not include the many incidents where people died in elevators and the injuries they sustained.

To better protect the public against elevator accidents, New York City enacted its "Safe Ride" program in 1994 under the leadership of Mayor Rudy Giuliani. While Safe Ride was designed to improve safety and reduce fatalities in urban areas, critics note that it is not enough. The program has created the illusion of safety when in fact it creates more safety problems when users are allowed to carry firearms for self-defense. After shooting down a gunman who tried to kill a woman, a driver was found to accidentally kill a female passenger and the passenger. New York City's Safe Ride program allows passengers to carry firearms to protect themselves against people who attempt to commit suicide, kidnap victims, or assault people in elevators. The program was implemented by NYCHA in 1993 as part of a package of reforms aimed at improving the safety of elevators and the city's transit system. Safe Ride is designed to "assist transit users in exercising personal judgement and safety; and to deter, minimize or eliminate unsafe, unsafe and dangerous behavior in elevators."

Gun safety in elevators is a complicated issue. While New York City has no mandated laws on gun rights, they recognize that any elevator customer can bring handguns on an elevator service to protect themselves and others. Elevators in New York City are located between streetcars and trolleys. All elevators must pass an individual check-in prior to use in order to meet the requirements of the Safe Ride program. A gun is required before any gun safety check can be undertaken.

The New York City Transportation Authority is the agency that oversees and implements safe and reliable elevators in New York City. NYCT's Safe Ride Program is administered through the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. There are 13 state levels of control over elevators in New York City, ranging from the department of transportation level two directly to the MTA or a federal agency. Elevators of all levels operate at all levels in violation of the Safe
