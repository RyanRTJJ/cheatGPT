While most reviewers found improvements to the user interface to be welcome, several noted shortcomings, from the inclusion of a new task pane, to the disappearance of the "Metro" touch-interface.

Despite the controversy surrounding Windows 8's user interface, Microsoft had anticipated such criticism, and, before the new release, had conducted user testing on Windows 8's Metro interface in preparation for a preview release. The test subjects were generally unhappy with the interface. Several of the subjects said that they had attempted to use Metro on their home computers, but realized that they had no idea how to navigate through the interface because there were no instructions on how to do so. Several said that the change was "obscure", making it difficult to use Metro with regular desktop applications. One subject was quoted as saying that even after the Windows 8 preview was released, he was still having trouble with the Metro interface on his home computer.

Microsoft planned to address some of these complaints with an additional release of Windows 8 which contained a revised interface based on feedback from preview testers. That build was called "Redstone" and was released
