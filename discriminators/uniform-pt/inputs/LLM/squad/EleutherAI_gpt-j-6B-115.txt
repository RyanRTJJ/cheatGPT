ppella polyphonic music was often performed by groups with as many as five or six singers, accompanied by one or more instrumentalists. They were often based on the plainchant, chant, and motet style of religious music, which was written to be sung by a solo voice. During a cappella music's golden age (c.1360–1430), the style of composers was influenced by the traditions of motet and chansonniers, such as Heinrich Isaac, Johannes Nipconius, and Adam de Bays. 
Some of the most important composers who contributed to the golden age include Johannes Ockeghem, Philippe De Monte, Johannes Martini, Johannes Eccius, and Antoine Busnois. Polyphonic a cappella music became popular in the Northern Renaissance period in Northern Europe, and began to flourish after the invention of the printing press. Some of the most important composers during this period were composers who wrote a cappella works for the church, like Laurentius Petri (c.1415–1479), John Colet (c.1384–1447), and Johannes Ockeghem (c.1410–1475). Between the time that composers switched from using only one (or a few) voices to using six (or more) voices in the composition, and the emergence of the Renaissance in Northern Europe, many of the old polyphonic compositions had been lost, as they were written a cappella.

After the invention of mechanical printing (c.1450), a cappella music was often performed by choirs and congregations. Johann Gutenberg brought the printing of books into the common hands of an average person, and the development of musical printing made possible the preservation of early music. In some parts of the world, especially Central and Southern Europe, this preserved the old traditions of sacred music. In the Northern Renaissance and Reformation period (c.1450–c.1650) a large number of Protestant denominations and groups of Reformation developed around Europe, and they relied on the common, but now preserved, musical traditions and repertoires of chant and
