 without regard to their own sense of self, like the 'all other men are racist' boundary. At the moment we do not have a comprehensive definition of an inclusive boundary, so we lack an explanation for why men might object to the notion of inclusion.

There are many practical barriers that we need to overcome to remove exclusiveness. For example, some men will not want a relationship with other men because they don't have a 'comparative advantage', meaning they are perceived by others as different from others. Another possible barrier involves men's fear of having men who are in the opposite sex look at them less favorably.

We also need to avoid giving men the appearance of being too much about them. For example, men who use their penis to have sex will probably want less attention than men who use the penis alone. They will probably want to be seen with someone else. One way men try to look less 'feminine' is by behaving more masculine (e.g. speaking more like their partner).
