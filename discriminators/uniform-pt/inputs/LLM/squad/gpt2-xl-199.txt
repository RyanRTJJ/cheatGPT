 "Tito's Tomb" in Belgrade and "The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier" in Belgrade.


Tito's last name was originally "Todorovic," a name derived from the Serbian, "dóro," meaning "the one-eyed," which Tito acquired from the Serbian people. In his autobiography, "The Autobiography of an Unknown Soldier," Tito said, "Before the Revolution, I was called Theone_eyed. I had one eye."


Following his death, his body was taken to Kraljevo where he was buried in the city's Zvečevan cemetery. He was laid to rest at a distance from Yugoslavia.


When he died he was not buried in Serbia, but in Croatia. During World War II Croatia, like Serbia, was under German occupation. In a bid to save face under Hitler's Nazis, the Yugoslav government refused to accept the body of Tito for burial in their country and instead sent that of its leader to Belgrade to the Serbian Cement Company, which was then operating under German supervision as part of the occupying forces. The bodies of those of Croatian soldiers who were killed during the war in Yugoslavia are also said to be buried in Belgrade's Rijeka cemetery.
