The next day, the Romans decided to take some precautions. All across the island, they issued a new type of water, known as potable water. This contained both salt and sulphites—the salt was the old Roman standard, but the sulphites were a more palatable and readily available option.

After one day of using the new water, the sick and dying soldiers finally seemed to perk up a bit, and then they started to ask for water again. One soldier with a fever complained about the low temperatures, and when his commander responded that it was actually hot in the desert because of the sun, the man suddenly fell asleep.

These were made as a drink or ointment in Greece, Egypt and even India, and only later were discovered to be especially good for drinking.
