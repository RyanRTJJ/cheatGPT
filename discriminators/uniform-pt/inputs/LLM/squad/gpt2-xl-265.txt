 and is an important element in the production of copper-filled wire and plumbing. Some of the oldest copper production is associated with the Minoans, Egyptians, the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians.

The ancient Egyptians and Egyptians used copper to build tombs and temples, copper pots found with them, etc.: See my Egypt page for references

The Sumerians and Babylonians made copper into alloys to make things like bronze, tin, tungsten, indium, magnesium, calcium, and iron (for tools and armor for example)

In the 3rd millennium BCE, the Sumerians used copper, tin, and silver as money, and the Egyptians traded their luxury objects in copper coinage. These early civilizations also built magnificent copper-enclosed cities and made copper weapons, tools and architecture with copper; see my page on Egyptian copper for examples. Copper was used by the ancient Greeks and Romans as well, including bronze: Romans used bronze as their currency, and they were especially fond of bronze-titanium alloy for weapons. Some bronze artifacts have survived. For example, the bronze statue of Hercules was cast in copper alloy, and may be one of the most unique pieces of bronze art.

The Romans also imported copper into the empire. This practice continued into the Middle Ages. The Greeks used copper to make copper and bronze-titanium alloy weapons and ships. The Romans exported copper to the Middle East, Asia Minor, and North Africa, as well as Britain, Spain and other regions.

The Greeks, Egyptians, the Sumerians, the Romans, and the Middle Ages may use various forms of copper.

The Romans also used metals such as iron and steel in various applications at different times in history. Some iron artifacts survive from early times and may have
