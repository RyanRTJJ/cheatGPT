assisted in a council at Serdica.

The Council of Serdica was a Christian church council organized by the Roman Emperor Constantius II. This council is known as the fourth Council of Constantinople. It was held in the city of Serdica (now modern-day Sofia) in the year 343 CE. It was attended by 318 bishops from the East, including Athanasius of Alexandria.

The main issue addressed at this council was the Arian controversy, which was a dispute over the divinity of Jesus Christ and the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son. Emperor Constantius had been an Arian, but was attempting to reach a compromise between the various factions and so convened the council to resolve the issue.

At the council, the delegates reached a compromise known as the Formula of Sirmium. This compromise affirmed the divinity of Jesus but did not identify Him as fully equal to the Father, as followers of Nicene Creed had maintained. Ultimately, the Formula of Sirmium failed to satisfy either the orthodox or the Arians, and it was eventually rejected by the Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius I in 381 CE when the Nicene Creed was re-affirmed as the official doctrine of the Eastern Church.
