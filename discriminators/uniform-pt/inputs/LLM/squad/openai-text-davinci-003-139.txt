 the people on this list were of Japanese ancestry.

The custodial detention list was compiled by the Bureau in response to the threat of a potential Japanese attack on the West Coast of the United States, which was seen as a very real threat in the 1930s and 1940s. The list included the names of people who were believed to be potential threats to security or public order, or who had a past history of involvement with pro-Japanese organizations. It was thought that the people on this list could potentially be a danger to national security in the event of an attack. 

The list was also used to target thousands of immigrants and citizens of Japanese ancestry for detainment in internment camps during World War II, along with other controversial programs such as the "alien enemy control" program and the "guardian" program. 

Over the past several decades, the list has been heavily criticized by historians, activists, and watchdog groups for violating the constitutional rights of individuals, as well as violating due process, as the FBI failed to prove any of the allegations, which were based on unsubstantiated rumors and accusations. 

In recent years, the list has become a subject of intense scholarly debate, as it has been used to examine issues of civil liberties, racial discrimination, and security paranoia in the U.S. during World War II and beyond.
