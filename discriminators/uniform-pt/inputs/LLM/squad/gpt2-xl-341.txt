 inside the mouth. These have usually been found in association with bones. However, an exceptional bone from a polychaete can be found in the mouth today.

The most primitive polychaetes possessed a single set of dentition. Those that later evolved into annelids and squamates had to adapt all six dentitions in order to keep the dentitions from becoming worn down due to constant biting. For this reason, annelids also evolved dentures to help with this task.

The dentities on the inside of the teeth served as barriers during the feeding process. During eating, a muscle that helped to move the jaw forward had to be constantly in use. This muscle was responsible for maintaining the six dentitions. In fact, dentary-like structures have been found on some annelids and squamates. But this type of structure has never yet been discovered in polychaetes. It probably developed before the other five dentitions were invented.

In polychaetes, the mandible is short and the mouth is closed with a single row of teeth. The jaw joint must also be very small, and the jaws must be thin, powerful, and powerful still. This combination of features is what enables these animals to exert a continual force on their prey.

Annelid jaws are made up of the dentition of small teeth that are attached to the dentary-like structures found in the mouth. At first glance, these may seem like primitive and uninteresting looking teeth. However, most of the dentitions in a simple annelid mouth are arranged for maximum bite force; they can crush fleshy plant parts like roots, squash seeds, and eat small prey like insects or crustaceans.

Annelids have relatively short molars with serrated, conical teeth. Their upper
