fficiently and aesthetically as possible. Of the original residence halls, Residential College South (RCS) stands out, having housed the university's first African American dormitory residents in 1968. The sprawling Quad, between the Main and South campus is home to most of the university's original structures and the South mall, which itself is still an important part of campus life. The university also has two additional dining halls, a library, athletic complex, and performing arts center. In addition, there is a medical center, research labs and faculty offices on campus as well. 

The university continues to invest in its physical plant, with recent upgrades to both the south Mall and Bailey Hall providing students with new space to learn and explore. New science buildings and renovations to residence halls, like the Lucas Hall renovations, have all been completed in recent years. The most recent addition, the Academic and Research Commons, is the universityâ€™s largest building project since its founding in 1965. The Commons has been an innovative addition to the university's physical plant, providing students with new library and learning spaces, as well as faculty offices and classrooms. 

Finally, the university also maintains beautiful outdoor spaces like the Arboretum, which allows for leisurely strolls, as well as a variety of sports fields and courts. With many new additions and renovations, the University of Michigan's physical plant is continuously growing and providing all students with the resources and environments they need to achieve academic excellence.
