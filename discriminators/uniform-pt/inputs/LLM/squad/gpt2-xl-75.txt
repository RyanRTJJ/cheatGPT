In the night sky, the Olympic flame will reach a maximum elevation of 15,000 feet, but with an air temperature ranging from 28 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit, it may feel more like 3,000 feet. At that altitude, the flame has a visible surface temperature of minus 15 degrees Celsius, or minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit.

The torchbearers may be more exposed to heat than those at sea level. At high altitude, the air is thinner, and therefore hotter. When the temperature reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the air becomes so thin that it condenses in tiny droplets. Those droplets become mist when they reach the air. When a large group is running together, they also must avoid these clouds of vapors. That is why, even though the Olympic flame is visible at the South Pole, it is
