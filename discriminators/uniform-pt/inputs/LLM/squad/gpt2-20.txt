 of his book to his descendants.

Although an incomplete version of the book can be gleaned from the English version, many passages in the text do not add up. For example, we have some references to the Bible in this passage in Genesis.

The title of The Origin of Species (translated by George Harkness to Darwin's book Book I) appears in the caption in the section on the origin of the creatures from which we have our first humans. Our current species have not yet developed as a species, so they do have the characteristics we expect from them. These characteristics include:

- Natural selection (natural selection for its own sake) - The fact that we are the closest to our original habitat.

- The fact that we are still the closest to the earliest extant species (the first human).

- On being in the human-like species, their genetic origin and social status.

- On being in a non-human species, their physical and mental stature.

This summary is taken from Darwin's first book about evolution, The Origin of Species, and Darwin's later book Origin of Species.

These two editions of The Origin of Species are divided into chapters that are presented in the following form:

- The Origin of Species and the Evolution of Man (the second two chapters, which are taken from the Genesis account of creation)

- The Origin of Species and the Evolution of Man

- The Origin of Species and the Evolution of A. I.

These two books will serve as a textbook for understanding how the concept of evolution and the evolution of species can be taught.
