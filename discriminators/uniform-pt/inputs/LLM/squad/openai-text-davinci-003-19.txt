, Link can travel freely between the Sacred Realm and Hyrule in pursuit of the villains responsible for the plight of Hyrule. By transforming into a wolf, Link gains the keen senses of animal perception and enhanced agility, making him better able to avoid physical traps, as well as foes. As a wolf, Link can also talk to certain animals to get different kinds of information that are inaccessible to him while human - such as the location of secret passages or treasures. In addition, Link can unleash powerful Digging Claws, allowing him to dig through soft surfaces and uncover hidden items. Furthermore, Wolf Link can call upon the powerful energy of the Triforce of Power to unleash a powerful energy known as the "Twilight Spin", destroying any surrounding foes.

However, in the Sacred Realm, Wolf Link is vulnerable to the powers of the various sages and Lanayru, the god of time. He must use his wolf form to outsmart and outrun the sages and time-manipulating puzzles. Link must also use the power of the Triforce of Wisdom in his human form to solve puzzles that are inaccessible to him as a wolf. Wolf Link, as well as his human form, must use their unique strengths in order to overcome the challenges the Sacred Realm throws at him. In the end, Link must use the power of both forms to defeat the villains of the Sacred Realm once and for all.
