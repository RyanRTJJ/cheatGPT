History

The building that houses the Palace of the Pyramids, the Maadi Palace, was occupied by the Maadi tribe for more than a thousand years. During the time of the Nubians the Palace was under the rule of Nebuk (Mafufek) a ruler in the 14th century BCE. As Pharaohs and Nubians were replaced by the Meroitic Dynasty, which lasted until the 19th century BCE, Egypt began to be invaded at first by the Hittites and finally by Alexander the Great during the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus. By the 13th century BCE Maadi had become a chief city of the Egyptian nation; at the time it was inhabited exclusively by the high ranking members of the nobility, who were known as the Maadi, Maati and Maati-Tiamati, literally "men of the Maadi", "men of the palace", and "men of the city". It remained the capital and the political centre of the country until the Middle Kingdom. The first kings of ancient Egypt, especially the founder of the Theocracy, Seti I, had their palace at Thebes. At the beginning of the 18th Dynasty the Maadi Palace was turned into a royal residence and the Maadi were gradually reduced to becoming a small upper class of the aristocracy.
