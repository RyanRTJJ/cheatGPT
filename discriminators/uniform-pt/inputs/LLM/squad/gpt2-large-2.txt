 was linked to al-Qaeda and the spread of nuclear weapons throughout the region, where there were large Iraqi Shi'ite Muslim populations.

The Obama administration disagreed. In 2011 it launched a war against the regime of dictator Saddam Hussein, which involved more than 6,000 American troops. The war cost a minimum of $800 million and took the lives of more than 100,000 American soldiers. The number of American forces in Iraq has since fallen to 350 and the conflict is officially over.

At the same time, American security services launched a massive assault on the terrorist organization of Al-Qaida, also known as Al-Nusra Front, using the use of airstrikes, missile strikes, special operations missions and cyber warfare to degrade, degrade and destroy Al-Qaida's ability to threaten the United States.

The end of the American war in Iraq also provided a convenient excuse to invade Libya in 2011, a country located only 50 miles from Syria, an area where the West had long argued it had a major interest.

To this date, the United States and its allies have suffered nearly four million refugees and have been fighting a war in Afghanistan and Iraq for the past 16 years in which tens of thousands of American soldiers and hundreds of thousands have perished.

So it is not surprising to see the Obama administration seek to re-write history through the rewriting of its own narrative. Obama is doing so by calling for a re-education of Americans on the basis of their past opinions on Islam and by pushing for a ban on some words.

In January, he wrote:

For too many Americans, the word "radical" conjures images of a medieval dark ages where fanaticism reigned and violence took place in the name of a literal interpretations of divine inspiration. Those fears have no place in today's country.

The Obama administration has also sought to rewrite history by insisting the term Islamic terrorism originates within the Muslim religion, which it insists is fundamentally different from "extremist terrorism" from which we have been able to distinguish at least since 9/11.

That, of course, is nonsense.

It is
