ultan was elected from a small tribe of his own, he was supposed to assume power and take over a large piece of land in the countryside. If he chose not to, it would be for nothing. His followers would find a way to get away with it just by moving and looting people — not necessarily as citizens, but as traders or as soldiers." "In many cases, the people were to be captured and later put on trial and punished with death," according to Dr. Günal, "and he was never able to convince the people of Istanbul to accept his proposal."

Dr. Pahlu said that, while most of the time the Turks accepted the Ottoman policy of accepting only the Muslims for the sake of maintaining "modernity" or as the "Baghdad of the West," "it's often not only the Muslims that accepted the Ottoman policy but the entire population that felt they were becoming weak."

Dr. Pahlu noted that, even in recent history when a dictator was in power, this policy was so well known that the state of Istanbul's Muslim population were even willing to "take measures to control their own populations. So they were willing to give up their religious traditions so that they could have something to eat, build mosques and take up the religious schools. And then after they thought they liked their people, they didn't believe in any of that. The situation became so tense that they eventually decided they would only allow the Kurds to govern for themselves and that this would only lead to other attempts at democracy, which was probably a better way to implement the Kurdish policy."

In a series of articles published on World Vision, Dr. Günal outlined how a Turkish Muslim has been held captive until he was able to stop it. In 2007 the Turkish authorities held his father until 2013. In the years since that article was published, there have been repeated attacks on the Turkish and Turkish-American governments. In 2014 the Turkish government blocked a planned US drone strike against three American journalists. Since
