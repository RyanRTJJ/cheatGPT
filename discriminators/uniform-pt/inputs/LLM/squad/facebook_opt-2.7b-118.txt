 the American Colonies decided to join the British alliance to resist the French. The war, in a series of conflicts known as 'The British-American War', lasted from 1812 to 1815, and resulted in the military and naval success of both sides.

For these men, land was to be theirs forever - whether or not they made it home.

Some of the first homesteaders were a couple named Tom and Sarah Jackson who sold their homestead to settlers in 1852, which had previously been owned by a family who had left the area decades before in
