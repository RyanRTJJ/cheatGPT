 Kagan Igor refused to support him against the Swedes. In spring 977, when the Swedes were besieging Novgorod, the town was captured by the Rus' army, and by summer Vladimir was in Kiev, with Sviatoslav's son Vladimir Vassilyevich (later Ivan IV Muscovite) on the throne. During the last three decades of Vladimir's life he had a series of disputes with his father's son and successor Michael Romanov. The war which was to end his days as Tsar was the last of his career; he died on 21 August 981.
As Prince of Kiev he was a brilliant military leader and an aggressive one who fought successfully against the Rus' forces of the Kagan and the Swedes. But he was also ambitious and vain and was inclined to tyrannise.
His first major campaign was against Vitebsk in 973-74. Kagan Igor refused to fight him in the battles over this town and a second campaign was forced on the young ruler. The Rus' army won a great victory at the Battle of Sotorye and the Swedes were beaten back. Vladimir held Kagan Igor at bay for two years and then in 975 took a town known as Olonets, to which the Kagan had retreated after the Battle of Sotorye. There he found his brother-in-law Gennady, son of Yaroslav the Wise, and with him he forced Vladimir to withdraw from Krakow and return to Kiev, where he was again confronted with Gennady. It was not long before
