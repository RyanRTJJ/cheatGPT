 average of 3.4 grade points less than their lower division students in maths.The comparison was carried out by two University of Exeter researchers, using data they had collected in 2013. The researchers said they were surprised to see Gymnasium grade inflation in Exeter. They believe that the level of exam pressure applied by school heads and the introduction of the Sats levels mean that students have had to be graded on more difficult standards in exams, leading them to lower grades.“The introduction of a four letter word, such as ‘sats’ has led to grade inflation in my opinion,” said Professor Stephen Stonier, who led the study. The professors also believe that Exeter may have introduced the sats system in the 1970s in an effort to improve its examination results.Stonier said the sats system was designed to test a student’s ability to tackle maths questions, while Gymnasiums students have had to complete assignments, which may not be on the same level.“At the time of the study we were using the sats system at Exeter for assessment and we were worried that our Maths students would end up with the lowest average in each subject,” Stonier said. But when he saw the analysis he said he felt his concerns had been unfounded.Students can be assessed under the sats system on questions such
