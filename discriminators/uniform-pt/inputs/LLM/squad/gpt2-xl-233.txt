.e., oxidizing agents), meaning their electrons have left the atom and are available for being transferred into one of two free electron states. The two available electron states in an oxidizing agent are either an electron for oxygen or one for carbon dioxide. Free radicals can be chemically modified to provide the desired state (e.g., becoming a sulfur electron acceptor or becoming a reduced electron donor). Thus, it is fairly straightforward to "design" new molecules incorporating new electron acceptors, reducing agents, or metal ions. This leads to the phenomenon of oxidation-reduction reactions, which are the basis for almost all cellular and organism reactions that utilize oxygen.

To put everything into a bit more detail, oxygen serves two important roles: the first is to provide chemical energy for most chemical reactions (e.g., electron transfer reactions in enzymes), and the second is to create a strong bond between two atoms. However, without oxygen, chemical reactions are "dead," or cease (e.g., breaking the bonds of water with ammonia). In order to provide the chemical energy needed for chemical reaction, oxygen must be introduced into the reaction "mimicry." For example, when you heat up water and oxygen, you release water energy/heat as heat (heat source). This heat dissipates into the environment, creating an air-conduction gradient and a decrease in atmospheric pressure (less oxygen atoms). When a compound reacts, it forms products (e.g., carbon dioxide as an oxidation of water; glucose is one example) and these
