, or 19 percent. That's more than two-thirds the length of the length of Seattle's streetcar lines.

Seattle's cold weather has also made commuting across Puget Sound problematic, which can make transit a challenge. The average daily commute to and from the center of Seattle is 18 minutes, or 20 seconds. On average this commute travels from Tacoma to Seattle over the Transbay Tube, at a combined cost of $23.90 per minute.
