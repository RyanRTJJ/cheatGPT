 the east and in the northwest and the Jura mountains to the southeast. The total area is 1,850,840 kmÂ² (549,818 sq mi) and has an area-to-volume ratio of 685:1. On the northern side of the Jura Mountains lies the small Alpine principality of Lausanne (Jura), and on the southern side is the larger canton of Geneva. The land masses of Switzerland are composed by very tall, steep and rocky formations that range in elevation in Switzerland from 1,280 ft (420 m) to 8,500 ft (2,000 m) or more. It is said that the Alpine terrain can, even for someone in good form, be so difficult to negotiate that for it to be possible for a driver to enter into the mountains. The Jura Mountains are the largest on the European continent due, in part, to their steep slopes, high elevation, and wide exposed areas. In a narrow valley, the valley of the Jura consists of three main peaks: the Kordel, which lies north of the Jura Mountain chain; the Grana, which lies directly adjacent to the Jura; and the Col de la Traversette. The main towns along the Jura Mountains are: Basel, St. Gallen, Lausanne, Lausanne (the regional capital), Lausanne (the "City of the Alps") and Berne. Most of this area borders on the Swiss Canton of Geneva, which lies to the south and west of the Jura. A large part of this area and its two main mountain chains is covered by glaciers. The glaciers that comprise the Jura Mountains have a long-standing history of glacial activity
