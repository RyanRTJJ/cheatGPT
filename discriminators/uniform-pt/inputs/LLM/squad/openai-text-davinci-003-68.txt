e from Holland to Berlin. Other motorways were soon built after World War II and the late 1950s, including the Berlin–Hamburg A24, the Berlin–Leipzig A9, the Berlin–Dresden A13, and the Hanover–West Berlin A2. By the end of the 1960s, a total of 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of motorways were in use in Germany.

In the 1970s, the country began to expand its network, building more than 6,000 miles (9,600 km) of Autobahn by the end of the decade. This expansion continued, with the number of motorways reaching over 13,000 miles (21,000 km) by the end of the century. Today, the German motorway network is one of the densest of its kind in all of Europe, with an average of more than 6 miles (10 km) of motorway per 100 sq mi (258 sq km) of land.
