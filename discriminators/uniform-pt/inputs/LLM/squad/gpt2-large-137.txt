 Top debuted with their album Take Back The Night, which propelled them to stardom as a group and catapulted Cooper to the top of the Billboard Hot 100. Cooper's popularity began to extend beyond the United States and by 1972 the guitarist had recorded over 100 recordings around the world as well as touring the world. He had become such an enormous success in Europe and the Arab World that the Lebanese dictator Nasser once even appointed him the nation's ambassador to the United States. At the same time, Cooper released the third single "In the Flesh," which was a single cut from his fourth album, Highway To Hell.

Cooper's first major break came with the release of The Velvet Underground's album The Velvet Underground & Nico (1971), which reached number nine in the US and Number Three in the UK and cemented Cooper as a cultural icon. His popularity on the charts continued to grow, and his live concerts took place around the globe. During his 1971 tour, the legendary guitarist would perform a second-ever rock concert, the "Night of the Living Dead," in which the band used live animals and skeletons as props. The venue for this performance, The Greek Theater in Port Chester, New York, was set entirely on fire and destroyed, although the fire still threatened to engulf the venue and the thousands of concertgoers gathered there. Cooper managed to escape the flames through a special ladder hidden under the stage. Despite the attack, The Velvet Underground's concert remained in progress and would be one of the last concerts held in this venue before the building's demolition. In September of 1973, Cooper would announce via The San Francisco Chronicle that he was to be recording his fourth studio album, Heaven's Door (1973), which would be the follow-up to his first two albums, The Velvet Underground & Nico (1972) and A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix (1975). The album was produced by Jimmy Page and recorded at The Fillmore East in
