As a reminder, the day after the election was "The Early Start of the Democrat National Convention in Cleveland." It was the first day of Donald J. Trump's campaign on the Republican end of the spectrum.

That was then. Now, Hillary Clinton has won the Electoral College four times, and now she is the president-elect. In the coming days, Donald Trump will be President of the United States.
