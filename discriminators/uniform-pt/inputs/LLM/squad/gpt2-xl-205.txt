 with over 1.21 million downloads sold in the first week and was certified Gold by the RIAA.

Although the album spent only one week at the top of the charts and the Billboard 200, it received a multitude of awards, including a Grammy Award for Artist of the Year and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.

On March 7, 2015, Beyoncé surprised Rolling Stone magazine with some not-yet-released music snippets from a live show she hosted in New Orleans for the magazine's 2016 Issue 51. The band featured on the album was B.o.B, who performed "Borders", a track from Lemonade and was later revealed to be the official album music writer. A photo gallery featuring the members of B.o.B went on sale the following day and included the accompanying lyric sheet from "Borders" as a backdrop. This photo gallery remained on sale until the release of O.L.L. (Out of Love).

The following year, the album was released for streaming on Tidal in the iTunes Store. Tidal became the first streaming service to ship Beyoncé's album.

After the album was delivered to the iTunes Store, the album was put on a streaming waitlist, forcing fans to wait weeks before the next stream happened. By July 15, 2016, however, Lemonade officially became available on Tidal, and was eventually fully released for streaming on the service on November 20, 2016.
