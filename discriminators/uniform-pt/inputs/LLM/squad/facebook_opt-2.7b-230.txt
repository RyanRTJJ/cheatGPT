The main types of plumage are;

 The down-turned feather coat with a prominent outer tail feathers. This is the winter plumage (in the English-speaking world).
 The downy feather coat; this is the summer plumage.
 The feathered-down feather coat known as the "feather down coat"; this is the moulted plumage from moults during pre-breeding months.

There has been a recent debate on whether bird down feathers are of a biological or non-biological origin, suggesting that they may be of a mixture of biological and non-biological origin.  For this reason, birds may only moult as "down" in the breeding season.

Taxonomy

The main kinds of feathers in birds fall into 3 major subtypes:

 The down-turned feather coat, or winter plumage. This is the standard plumage (in most species) of a bird, and is often confused is the same as that of a winterfowl (the downy winter plumage). This feather cover has the form in which out feathers are arranged around the base of the tail, with their bases forming a downy tuft.
 The downy feather coat; or the summer plumage. This covers the tail of a bird, and its feathers are generally lighter and fluffier than those on the down-turned feather coat.
 The feathered-down feather coat, or the feather down coat; or the moulted plumage. This is the moulted plumage from moults during pre-breeding months.

The plumage can also be broken down into distinct sections with varying colors of down (white, brown or black) as well as distinct feather styles (the feather types most similar to human hair).
