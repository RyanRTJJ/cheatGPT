 (1885-1972) and erected in Paris, France. This is a building that stands today in the city's Marais neighborhood.

The architects behind Maison Cubiste were Marcel Carrel (1862-1940) who designed the building's entrance and the museum's large circular collection of furniture, sculptures, paintings, and illuminated documents within. Their main challenge was to incorporate the large number of different materials in the exhibition into various rooms and exhibit their effect through their various settings and materials, as well as to create a unified display of the artworks.

The Maison Cubiste has often been called "one of the greatest architectural interventions of the 20th Century," in part because of its use of numerous materials, the variety of locations, and its placement in its larger setting.

The architects chose to use a white concrete and steel frame to support the large white concrete structure which was built at an angle. A concrete slab supported a metal plate which was suspended from various steel rods and supported the main gallery. The steel frame and concrete wall was placed horizontally against a polished black steel roof.

The artworks were contained in aluminum casings with the gallery being situated within. The casings housed a selection of sculptures, paintings, and illuminated documents.

The Maison Cubiste was also known for its large collection of large paintings. This collection included works by Georges Seurat, Paul Cezanne, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Pablo Picasso and includes works that have been valued at $7.9 billion.

The museum exhibits large collections of both domestic and European cultural history. This collection includes such exhibits as:

The "Lacoste Room" for clothing
