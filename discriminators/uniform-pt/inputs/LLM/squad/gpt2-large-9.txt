The palace has six crypts to its left and five or six large chambers to the left and right of the central courtyard.

It is possible to find more detailed information on the tombs of the princes in the ancient city of Yathreb by researching the cemetery of Yathreb, one of the most important Christian cemetery of the Old City and later in the Muslim city of DiyarbakÄ±r and the Christian part of Antakya-Kastamonu and Sivas, which was excavated in the early 1930s.[4] It was in fact founded and excavated when the Yathreb city was founded in 1083 and it is the largest Christian cemetery in the world.[5]

Yathreb was a city of religious significance for the early Christians. This included the monastery that was founded by Saint John Baptista in the early eighth century. It remains an important place of pilgrimage in the early Islamic culture, although it was a place where it wasn't uncommon to find Christian burial places.
