 This is called transboundary movements, and this paper gives a review of the literature on this topic. We first introduce a conceptual framework for the phenomenon, then discuss evidence for its increase between the 1930s and the 1970s and the rise between the 1990s and the start of the 20th century. We give attention to transboundary movements associated with land-use change, but also to global commerce with other species. We conclude with suggestions for future research and policy.

We first introduce a conceptual framework for the phenomenon. The conceptual framework is based on an overview of theoretical models of invasive species and transboundary movements for invasive species. In doing so, we provide an overview of the literature on both of these topics.

We then discuss evidence for this increase in the number of species invasions between the 1930s and the 1970s. Several studies report a rise among land-use change and transboundary movement studies. Global commerce and transboundary movement studies are relatively rare, and it is difficult to assess their incidence and severity. Among them, we give due weight to studies showing an overall rise in transboundary movements with land-use change, whether these rise in incidence rate or severity. We find that the species of economic importance to human society have been involved in the most significant transboundary movements. However, our review also makes some preliminary findings for transboundary movements in global commerce and in some species, such as sharks. Among
