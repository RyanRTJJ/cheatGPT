ased host material is introduced into the growth medium and the medium incubated. The growth of the designated agents in the medium or other changes in their growth can be observed and the presence or growth of a particular agent indicates that an associated disease condition in the host material exists.
One problem with the diagnostic ability of microbiological cultures is the inability to distinguish or separate two different microorganisms from a single culture. For example, a single bacterial culture can contain an antibiotic sensitive (susceptible to antibiotic therapy), an antibiotic resistant (resistant to antibiotic therapy) and a non-pathogenic (benign) microorganisms that have different cell wall chemical reactions. Further, because the culture does not contain any other antimicrobial agents or other components, the presence of antibiotic resistant colonies that do not reproduce in culture as a pathogen cannot be identified. In addition, some microorganism produce toxins harmful to a host being tested. The toxins damage tissues and interfere with the growth and metabolism of cells and tissue. The use of cultures is a limitation in diagnosis of such disorders and diseases.
Because of the limitations of microbiological culture, a number of tests have been developed to permit distinguishing between these different microorganisms in a single sample. Two tests which permit the discrimination of strains of a single organism from one another or from other organisms are the hemagglutination (HA) test or the
