 and social comparison, egotism focuses primarily on the self’s own experience, beliefs, and attitudes, whereas self-concept entails the idea that one’s personal standards are different from others’. Furthermore, the egocentric view of other people allows the self to develop an inner world of beliefs, experiences and aspirations that is unique and personal, and it is important to note that in adolescence, self-reflection becomes an integral part of identity formation during this phase of development.

When adolescents compare themselves to others, their focus is often on the self and what it means to live an “OK” life. The ego’s concern is to secure an ego identity through the achievement of social relevance and influence.

Self-image and self-concept are closely related terms, although the former seems to include a larger scope of the self. We often use them interchangeably, but there is a significant difference in the way they are explained in psychology. In this paper, self-concept and self-image are used interchangeably.

The term eudaimonic self-esteem appears synonymous with self-efficacy, in which the subject is able to define who s/he is and be accepted for that identity and achieve a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment. (Meyer-McHugh, 2002; Steptoe & Cooper, 2002).

Egocentrism may result from several factors in a child or adolescent’s social environment, or may be innate. Even a child who has received many positive messages about himself or herself will continue to develop a narcissistic, egocentric view if his or her parents’ behavior confirms the positive view. A child might begin to see or believe that he or she
