, Guadeloupe, St. Martin, and St. Barts. Henry II's father had been born to a baron of Anjou, and, while he enjoyed some authority in the area, the Barons of Anjou had long been frustrated in their attempts to consolidate their authority. It was after Henry's brother, Charles II, defeated Edward I in battle in 1166 in Yorkshire that William of Orange, who had been in exile in Anjou for a year, returned to England.

William did not stay long, and after William's death his brother, Henry III, appointed Sir Nicholas de Bratton anointed his son and heir to his throne. Henry III gave his daughter Eleanor to William of Orange. William's reign was plagued by rebellions and civil war. Throughout his reign, Henry III was besieged and beset by the French. The French invaded England in February 1170 and took the crown of England in January 1172.

Despite the constant threats to his life and his rule, Henry III managed to keep his people safe. His daughter Eleanor survived his death by being buried near Rochester; her younger son William was born a year later. To save his own life, William did everything he possibly could to preserve his father's throne at the expense of his own life. During William's reign he defeated the French in battle, gained an impressive military advantage, and then returned to the north with a substantial amount of royal wealth and jewels. On his way South, William gave his son William to Sir Thomas de la Pole, Lord of the Isles, in return for a dowry stipulated by both William's father and the king.
