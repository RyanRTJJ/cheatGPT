 year ([@B1]). Further, romantic relationships are associated with important physical, psychological, and social outcomes throughout the life span ([@B1]). This review explores the effects of adolescents' peer relationships on romantic relationship development, particularly from a development neuropsychiatry (*Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* \[DSM\]-5) perspective. We discuss the role that peer influences play in helping adolescents develop, form, and maintain romantic relationships. We also review the evidence concerning the development of romantic relationships in the context of social status and peer group, gender and peer group, and peer group and parental influences on the adolescent romanticization of peers. We focus on romantic romanticization (e.g., the attribution of romantic, partner, and self-attributes to an important person or group; [@B27]) in this review. Finally, we propose that a more inclusive neurodevelopmental perspective could address some gaps in the literature surrounding romantic relationships for adolescents by attending to the multiple systems responsible for developing an understanding of others and of the self ([@B17]; [@B33]). We argue that the "multiple, interactive, and complexly distributed human experience of others" can more accurately be described when focusing on the experience of peers, romantic partners, and the self. This review begins with an introduction to the neuroscience of peer relationships.

Peer Development Neuroscience
=============================

There is a large body of research exploring the developmental origins of the peer group phenomenon ([@B25]; [@B2]; [@B26]; [@B10]; [@B18]; [@B6]; [@B19]). [@B20] suggests that "peer groups provide a primary context for developing a sense of belonging and competency that are vital
