 and often referred to as "the moulting plumage" (as opposed to "flowing plumage"). Plumage is generally not formed entirely by the growth of tissue; there is no growth of the feathers on the sides of the neck nor at the shoulder. Each crest is approximately 90 mm (2/3") in length, and they form around 80 to 100 times between the crowns of the wings. These feathers have 4 upper surfaces, with the upper surfaces surrounding the wing base and the lower surfaces the lowermost surface; the crest is made of a soft, milky, white layer which remains firm throughout the life of the bird. The most commonly collected plumage for the Redhead is the young plumage around the age of 20, which is commonly the youngest plumage in a redhead.[17]

The first wingless, non-breeding plumage in Redheads is likely approximately 60% complete by this time. The earliest of the surviving young male plumages will have completed about 60% of the wingless mature plumage and will have remained wingless for at least a year by this time; this bird was probably not the first Redhead to be wingless.

Redheads will have no wings.

Redheads can be distinguished from most other large raptors and small birds with a birdseye of gray-green in the middle of the breast; it is the typical color of its range.

Redheads are a somewhat smaller, lighter-bodied species. It is fairly common for Redheads to reach an adult size of about 2.5 to 3.5 m (8-10 ft) from head to tail. Generally they are lighter birds, with a slight preference for water.
