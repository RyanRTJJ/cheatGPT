 many cases, these are introduced species, such as rats and rabbits. Humans also introduce new species to the wild. The primary way to avoid this type of wildlife invasion is to be on the lookout for the invasive species first, so they are detected, eliminated and returned to the wild. But you want to avoid wildlife invasion at all costs.

So you can think of it quite simply. When you live near wildlife, you are an unwitting carrier of a potentially dangerous animal. This is especially true when the animal attacks other animals or humans on your property, and humans are the animal's natural predator.

This means that as a homeowner, one of the first things you need to do if you see or discover an invasive animal is to take several measures to contain or remove it from your property. (But make sure you consider the potential of the invader before you remove it.) One way to prevent an invasion of any type is to have effective predator management techniques in place. This means that you keep your pets and animals on your property to maintain a healthy and stable ecosystem in which people can enjoy their outdoors, where they will likely be less stressed and less likely to inadvertently introduce these animals.
