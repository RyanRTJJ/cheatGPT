 System. The system was successfully installed in the Netherlands in April 1992. The system consisted of 1.7 MW parabolic dish unit consisting of a 120" x 72.5" parabolic dish. The system is fed by solar energy generated by the system, and the heat is supplied to a heat exchanger that extracts heat from water. The heat exchanger cools the water, leaving the water free to soak in the sun throughout the day. The total system cost of the equipment was approximately 4$ per 100 kW. The following table describes the basic components:


Solar Total Energy System (PDES) = 6x3MW

Power = 12MWh

Temperature = 75Â°F

Efficiency = 70%

Powered by solar energy from sun, and heat from water


The main advantages of combining concentrated solar energy with thermal energy storage are the following:

1. Solar energy is continuously available to provide heat (see "How it can be done").

2. Thermal energy is used for cooling while the solar energy is used for heating.

3. The combined value of the two energy sources at the production site is close to the "true costs as determined by conventional electricity production."

For those considering high-volume manufacturing, the following figures (as a rough approximation of the total cost) may also apply:

1.20 MWh heating cost per annum

1.20 MWh cooling cost per annum

For other applications such as small-scale agricultural, industrial and domestic use, the costs are considerably lower due to solar heat and storage efficiency.
