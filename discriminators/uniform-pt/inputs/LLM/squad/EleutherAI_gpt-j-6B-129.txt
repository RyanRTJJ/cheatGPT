 uprising spread that far. The Senate was particularly worried about Gaul, as the whole island was a potential hotbed of revolt.

The Gauls launched their uprising at the end of the summer. Like the Britons, they started with a lightning strike at the city of Aquitaine. The army which took over the city was led by a young warrior named Vercingetorix, a nephew of the chief of the Arverni tribe, Vercingetorix. He soon began rallying his forces, with mixed success. At first, he got little help from the neighboring tribes and most of his efforts were wasted. In fact, it was Gaul who started the uprising. The Senate, fearing that Gaul would join with the Britons, decided to give up on the peninsula.

In October, the Roman army, under the direction of Gaius Marius, was mustering in Spain. He was the first of many generals who would play a significant role in Rome's war with the Gauls. It is possible that one of Marius's goals was to keep an eye on the situation in Gaul.

But before Marius could engage the Gauls in battle, Vercingetorix came to Rome with envoys. Marius, who liked to be the main player on the field of battle, immediately took the field, at the head of 80,000 armed men. He found the enemy forces in three separate towns. He defeated them in a battle near the city of Alesia (modern Alost), where the Gauls were trapped. There were probably a lot of deaths, including at least one Roman general.
