Elements of the Japanese divisions that had been fighting in Northern Burma and the Western Pacific had been diverted to reinforce the Japanese defenses in the Philippines, so the available Japanese forces in the area consisted of the 3rd Division, the 6th Division, the 10th, 48th, 66th, and 120th Regiments, a battalion of tank destroyers with an unknown number of antiaircraft guns, and five field artillery battalions.
