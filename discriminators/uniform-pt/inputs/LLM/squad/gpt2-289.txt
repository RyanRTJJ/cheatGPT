Many of those who don't want Microsoft to do this need to either do away with their Windows 8 devices or run a software update that changes or reduces the functionality. While many people think this won't work, it certainly does.

For the uninitiated or those who would prefer a free upgrade of Android devices, the Windows 8 Update update to Android 4.3.3 includes a new version of Windows 8 called Windows 8.1. This version can be downloaded right from here.

There are plenty of different versions available. You'll notice a large number of different variants and we've set out to have our hands on each before we're happy with a free or paid copy.

All the details of the Microsoft Windows 8 update process are available here. So far, this is available on a select number of devices running Windows 8. One reason users could not download and install the new version is that they had to have Windows 8 installed from Windows 7 or earlier. We're looking forward to seeing what people are able to get with these different versions.
