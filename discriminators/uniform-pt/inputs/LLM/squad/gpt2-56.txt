 be younger than previously acknowledged (Moses, 1977; Schreiber, 1981): (1) a typical Arab American, of African descent, who came to Palestine via Europe to settle in Israel, and (2) one male from the same family lineage that was introduced in Central Europe (Ijbrahim, 1993; Kallman et al., 1999; Pritsch and Lacham, 2002). However, some people from that lineage appear to have died before they were "cured of" the disease.

In recent years of genetic profiling of Arab Americans, some have pointed out a striking shift of ancestry: more Arabs (about 14 percent) and Jews (12 percent) descended from a group the ancient Egyptians regarded as "non-Jews." The shift is described in the following passage by Pritsch and the recently resurrected Riddik (2000), after a number of well-known and well-regarded researchers (Cramer, Hirschfeld, et al., 2001: 22–33) published their results in 2004 (cited in Riddik and Pritsch, 2000). For instance, they cited a study of 3,150 Palestinian Arabs and 552 Jewish Arabs, "who arrived in Israel and were either taken during Jewish migration or during the Jewish exile period," indicating that the Arabs of the 3,150 cohorts who arrived came primarily from the Middle East, not from the rest of the world.

The authors looked more closely at their data—of the three Arab American cohorts of the 7,800 that arrived in Israel
