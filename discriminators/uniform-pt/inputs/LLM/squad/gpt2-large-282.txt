Graecus

The most important god of the Indo-Greek world is the famous Greek name for the goddess of earth, who is also called the "fertility goddess". Her name was the same as the Latin goddesses "Goddess of the earth," and this is clearly a name used for the Greek goddess and for one of the two possible Earth goddesses, the other being Gaia. The Greek name (her Greek title, Graecus) is an honorific title like that of Diana for Diana the Princess; but the honorific was given to her as a title, since she is the ancient title of the Olympian goddess of the earth. Her earliest known version, dating to the fifth or sixth century BC, is thus probably an alteration of the Indo-Greek goddesses' original names, which had originally been associated with the Greek god Hermes.

She is traditionally represented as a shepherd of the earth, and she is the counterpart to the Greek Greek goddess of war, Athena.

The original version of Graecus had two parts: the first was the goddess of motherhood and the second, that of earth and the vegetation, was not attested; this was changed in the sixth century BC, when the character of the godess changed to that of a god of the earth, since it was believed that the first part of the name was taken from the name of the first goddess Aphrodite, the goddess of the earth and vegetation.
