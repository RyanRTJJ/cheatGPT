 is a little like being on Mars and then driving in a car.
Thanks, I appreciate it.   What about a plane on a trailer, you know one that's attached to another airframe? Could it take off/land like that?
That would be much better, and not too difficult. In the late 90s a couple of Airbus planes were brought into London from Barcelona. There was a problem with the brakes on the trailer, because of friction or something, and one of them slid down the runway in front of a lot of people with cars driving on the track. Fortunately it only ended with a few people with minor injuries.
Oh wow! That's terrible! What was the outcome? I'm very curious.  I can imagine that there are a lot more regulations etc. I guess, I'm just ignorant. Did they use a completely different aircraft than what's being used now? Like did they fly with a different plane than the one it landed on?
The aircraft was a 747, so the same type used for short-haul flights to South America. The first few planes were modified. The accident happened to an older model, but that didn't stop them from trying to make that happen more.
It must have been some scary stuff. I mean, I guess, you never know. But the fact that it had to be brought in with all the extra equipment from Europe and stuff is pretty crazy! I guess it's just easier for them. Thanks!
I've seen a Boeing 747 come in with about a 3 acre cargo of equipment for London Heathrow (the busiest airport in the UK), they used a completely different aircraft and it
