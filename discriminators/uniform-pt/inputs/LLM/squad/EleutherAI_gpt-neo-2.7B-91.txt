 their interaction. The Feynman diagrams would, in fact, be the only physical description of the phenomena, since all other means of modeling anything would be strictly forbidden. However, not since Newton have we understood quantum mechanics and how it works.[5] The ability to "observe" an object from an initial position and later "observe" that same object from a later position would certainly be an entirely different class of observations from the familiar ones, and also require a fundamentally different set of tools to be explained (just as distance is measured by two different tools to give two different measurements, such as length and breadth).

What could quantum mechanics tell Feynman about the distance between a particle's position at an instant in time, xi, and another's at a later time, xj, once both, and no more, are available? Quantum mechanics gives us only probabilities—or likelihoods—that a particle is at a certain object at that moment in time. How likely could any two positions be to exist at the same instant in time? The answer is that they cannot, given the laws of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics tells us the probability for two positions xi and xj to be at the same moment in time would be zero. We could not, in fact, find out either if we were given an infinitely fast clock whose rate could reach infinity. Yet, that is what Feynman is interested in, since he is interested both in time (and, in particular, he is interested in what it means in quantum mechanics)
