 band Simple Minds. Another famous rock musician who uses single-stringed electric mandolins is Mike Pinder of Pinder & Jones. There are also mandolin versions of cellos, violins and double basses.

Mandolinists can learn to play in the same fashion as classical mandolin players, in that a mandolin is a violin with a fingerboard. Most classical mandolins come with a flat steel or bamboo fingerboard, while a mandolin typically has a metal, spruce or paulownia fingerboard. (Bamboo is also an option in this instrument category, but this is not commonly seen.)

Mandolins have traditionally been made by Japanese and Chinese and they are of particular use in China, because of the large population of mandolin players in the country. Another musical instrument that is a mandolin is the mandolin-banjo. An important difference between the two instruments is that the mandolin banjo is played with the bow, while a mandolin is mostly played with a stick.

Mandolins are normally sold with a string set in the case. The most important string is the single melody-string, which comes in an 8 or 12-string length. This string is a separate string, and is very long, for greater flexibility. Some mandolins include a second melody string in the case, which is similar to a standard mandolin. Other mandolins can use a long-distance pickup system to allow the use of high-output pickups with a smaller pickup on the mandolin body.

The most important standard, for mandolin players, is a 14-string model. The tuning is 5/7, 1/A,
