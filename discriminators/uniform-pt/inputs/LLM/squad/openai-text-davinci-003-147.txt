 have pre-Christian roots.

Corpus Christi was a religious festival celebrated in the medieval period, from the Latin meaning "body of Christ". It was held on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday and concentrated on the veneration of the Eucharist (remembering Christ's Last Supper). Other medieval pageants and festivals celebrated during the period include May Day, which celebrated Spring's return, and All Hallows Eve (Halloween), which gathered together for communal celebrations of Satan's defeat in the Battle of Heaven.

Carnival, which is often associated with Mardi Gras, is a multi-day season of festivities the weeks leading up to Lent. Some say that Carnival in the medieval period originated from celebrations by agricultural workers to welcome in the arrival of longer days with more light and warmth, a time when work could be done and crops could grow. Others assert that Carnivalâ€™s beginnings lie in pagan celebrations of wild abandon. Local traditions and customs, such as costumes, street performances, and music, have become popular elements of Carnival as well.

Carnival and other pageants and festivals, such as Corpus Christi, have continued to be celebrated in many different forms throughout the ages. Today, Carnivals are celebrated in many parts of the world, with the biggest celebrations in the Caribbean. While all of these festivities are linked to their roots in the medieval period, they have evolved to become widely adapted celebrations of joy and revelry.
