 U.S. naval units, Task Force 34 (TF34) under Admiral Willis A. Lee, Task Group 77.4 (TG77.4) by Rear Admiral Clifton A.F. Sprague and escort carriers of Task Group 77.2 (TG77.2).

The U.S. units reached the San Bernardino Strait to contact the Japanese fleet at 06:12, but Kurita passed them unnoticed at 06:20, despite the US ships being stationed directly in the middle of the strait. The US forces had expected Kurita to turn eastward for the Leyte Gulf battle and had limited their visibility by not utilizing radar in their search. Consequently, Kurita was able to slip through San Bernardino Strait unseen and unharmed.

Kurita's ships then headed south, aided by strong currents that pushed them away from the Americans, who did not notice his squadron until late in the afternoon. It was not until 18:00 that the US forces realized that the Japanese had gone through the strait. By this time, Kurita was too far away to be engaged by the US squadrons.

The Japanese fleet sailed along the coast of Samar until the early morning of October 26, when US aircraft made contact. Kurita opened fire at the Americans, with several strikes hitting the destroyer escorts Hutchinson and Richard P. Leary and the destroyer Smalley, before the Japanese force scattered into the night in the aftermath of the Battle of Samar.
