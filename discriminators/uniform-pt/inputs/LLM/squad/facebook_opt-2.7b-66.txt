ai may have poisoned the imperial couple, although the true extent of Cixi’s involvement has been questioned. Cixi’s descendants continued to rule after the emperor’s death.

The Cixi family were originally from the Chinese province of Fujian and had migrated to the modern Xiamen area. By the time of Cixi’s ascension, China had officially established trade relations with Xiamen in 1689, and had built several coastal trading ports on the island, including Xidan, Bao’an, and Sanmenxia. By the early 19th century, many Chinese residents of Fujian began to migrate to mainland China.

By the early 18th century, China had become a major player in international trade, and many of its trade ports had developed a large amount of foreign influence as Chinese merchants traveled the world. The Han Chinese leaders were not content for their nation to merely use these ports, and decided to try to establish trade with foreign countries, despite the growing internal unrest caused by the Qing monarchy and Chinese dynasties.

In the early 18th century, the Qianlong Emperor’s reign (1644-1722) in China coincided with the early rise of the British power. The Qianlong Emperor had become a British ally, and in the early 1700’s, a naval treaty was signed between China and Britain. In 1710, the two countries agreed that there would be no formal diplomatic relations between China and the British, but that the Chinese and British navies would “exchange visits”.
