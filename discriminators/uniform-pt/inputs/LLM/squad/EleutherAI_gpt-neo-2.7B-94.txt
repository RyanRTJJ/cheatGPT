, _vocalistis,_ and in the words of the article by Jean-Michel Rabaté, co-author, and architect Jean-Paul Riopelle. It was a monumental sculpture that was built inside the large and very wide Cubism gallery called the Salon d'Automne (Conception of Automn) that had been used since the 1890s for a series of highly influential shows, most notably the 1909 Venice Biennale. In 1909 it had been the first time an exhibit in Paris was held outside the Louvre, the French Museum of Natural History, the Musée d'Orsay, and the Museum of Fine Arts.

Riopelle had begun by building a house with an arched façade; he then built a sculpture that was an extension of the arched façade with a vertical shaft that he built. It is hard to conceive that a sculpture like this can be seen as an architecture, since it is a sculpture that is an extension of a structure rather than a structure itself.

In the late nineteenth century Cubists like Léon Boni and Auguste Renoir experimented with the use of cubism in their drawings and paintings. But because it was not possible to
