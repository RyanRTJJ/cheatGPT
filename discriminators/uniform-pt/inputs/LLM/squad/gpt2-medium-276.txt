As a consequence, the use of scientific words changed from words to labels: for de Fontenoy, scientific vocabulary became "a very necessary part of the vernacular [because] it allows one to differentiate between matter or ideas, which are separated by logical concepts, and things like matter or ideas, which may or may not belong to one of the two kinds we called 'facts'."[36] De Fontenoy also observed that scientific concepts are easily understood, whereas "common speech or common sense, or whatever the word may be in its own language, is not."[37]

Some commentators, however, argued that the rise of science and its role in the modern economy created a "vibrotyping effect whereby ideas of the value of commodities or of products become part of the common vernacular."[38] More recently, Richard Sennett and Geoffrey Pullum wrote on the "vibrotyping effect as a result of computer technology that has made all existing scientific concepts, even those whose use is restricted to experts, part of 'the vocabulary of the majority of the public.'"[39] In this view many of the words (e.g., "commodity," "product") have been transferred from words of value to concepts of value that can be used by the general public.[citation needed]
