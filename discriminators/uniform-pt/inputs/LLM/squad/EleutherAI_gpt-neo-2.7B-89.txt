The oil price fell again. Libya experienced a third oil crisis in the 1980s. When the U.S. cut off aid, Libya moved to privatizing many key industries by selling them to foreign companies. The IMF refused to provide loans. Instead Libya used funds from its national bank to prop up the ailing economy. Many Libyan officials in the new government argued for full economic reforms, including deregulation and new taxes. In 1986, Libya also tried to get help from the U.S., Germany, France, and Italy to build a new gas pipeline to import natural gas from the U.S. The EU and Russia offered Libya subsidies for the natural-gas project. However, the U.S. and EU refused to give Libya economic aid, including economic aid for the gas pipeline. The U.S. and other nations threatened that they would cut off aid to Libya if Libyan officials did not agree to full economic and political reform within one year. The U.S. also provided no additional aid between 1986 and 1988. In 1988, the U.S. cut off Libya's access to the World Bank
