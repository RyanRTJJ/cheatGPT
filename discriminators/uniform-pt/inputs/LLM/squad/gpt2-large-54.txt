 of 6 million soldiers from Korea, Ryukyu, Kyushu, and Manchuria (八族). These were led by Toyotomi Hideyoshi's grandson, the last chief general of the Kumamoto-in-fu (町骨) (see also the section on Toyotomi Hideyoshi). Hideyoshi had learned all that one needed to know about his army from his master, Miyashita Tohshiro. Hideyoshi, like Miyashita of course, was not a master of war and did not know how much blood his forces would have to shed. What he was able to do was to recruit the best of Chinese and Koreans who were already in place and were ready to lay down their lives for his army.

Hideyoshi's army of Korean and Chinese forces met the Chinese forces in the Sea of Japan on August 13 of that year. When the two lines met for a full month, the Chinese did not fight on both sides. As a result, the Chinese were able to hold out until October of that year, at which point Toyotomi Hideyoshi took advantage of the delay and launched an attack on Sōkyō.

Hideyoshi's forces had been defeated there by the Chinese of Toyotomi Tawang who was the fourth great general of that country. Tawang had been one of the most popular generals of that era. His army had gained much admiration for the bravery and skills displayed by his defenders when, after they had been defeated at Sōkyō, they had taken to the high ground and fled from the Chinese. Hideyoshi had been a member of the Tawang's army, and a part of the general council of that army. Hideyoshi was not able to break into the main Chinese lines, but was at least strong enough to prevent Tawang from making a strong assault on the nearby province of Shinagawa which was under the control of a local chief named Sukeban.
