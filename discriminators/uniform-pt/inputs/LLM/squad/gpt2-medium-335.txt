 group, 4% and 11%, respectively, of the DNA of Jewish Americans matched the reference to world Muslims ancestor group, and 11% of the DNA of Jews matched the reference to world Christians ancestor group. The results were confirmed in the 2013 study by Bray et al., finding that when including European ancestry, less than 1% of Jews and Arab Americans matched the reference world Jew. Only 4.3% of European DNA does.

Why was the claim that there are 6% non-Jewish Americans who are non-Asians completely unsubstantiated? The reason is that the original claims on this point were based on the idea that European "non-European" cultures were actually different from Western non-European cultures.

That's not true:

Since European admixture would not be nearly as rare as the claim that there are only 6.8% of non-Jews in the world, it seems possible that some Europeans have not "desired" to be associated with the world Jew because they have been forced into that association without fully realizing the potential consequences of it, or because they have not yet developed the same concerns about intermarriage, or maybe because, if they do, they have been too busy getting married. And it's also possible that they are merely afraid that they will not fit in in any meaningful way with the world Jew, because, if they don't, they will think of the world Jew as an alien threat to their "right-wing Christian" lifestyle.

There is, of course. This is not to say that non-Western European ancestry is not related to the origins of Judaism
