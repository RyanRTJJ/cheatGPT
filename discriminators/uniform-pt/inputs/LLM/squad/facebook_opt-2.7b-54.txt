 army of 1,250 men in the Ryukyu Kingdom of Japan and attacked China in disguise.

Hideyoshi disguised himself as a young priest called Echizen (丸真), a high official of the Ryukyu Kingdom.

He began his plans on March 4, 1592, and ordered his army to assemble in the city of Okinawa (福岡県) where the king kept his summer retreat.

Hideyoshi moved his army along to the Korean Peninsula then on the east coast of the peninsula as far as the river Taegu which is near Nampo (내비).

On March 21, he dispatched Hideoki Mitsuhide (立見村), a soldier from the Chinese Imperial Army, who lived on the island of Shimosu (古港) to invade Nampo.

Hideyoshi took a supply of rice with him and hid on the island to wait for Mitsuhide.

The city of Nampo was located on what is now Pyeongan province (formerly Pyeongchang province), but was part of Baekje Province (부지석 province) under the Nambu regime before the Baekje Kingdom (9th century to 1568) was unified under the Goryeo Dynasty, the current kingdom of Korea, in this period.

On March 24, Hideyoshi and Mitsuhide made their way to the southwestern tip of the Korean Peninsula at the small port town of Suwon, around 2 hours from the city of Dongsaeshi (대사죠리; Nampo).

Hideyoshi and Mitsuhide had only a few soldiers each and a supply of rice. The soldiers had to fight with each other and the enemy while carrying the rice to the king.

This kind of guerrilla warfare was something the Chinese Imperial Army was quite good at.

Hideyoshi and Mitsuhide had no military supplies and could not retreat to the Ryukyu Kingdom, but Hideyoshi wanted to capture Baekje and destroy its army before the invasion of China could be carried out,
