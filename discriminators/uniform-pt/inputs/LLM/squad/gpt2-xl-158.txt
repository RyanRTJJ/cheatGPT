 was the Big 12 Player of the Year in 2015.

"Wichita State has been an elite program for more than two decades, and this announcement further enhances the tradition of this iconic school," Kansas State president Kirk Schulz said in a statement.

Linn has a reputation as being a tough coach. In addition to his time at Wichita State, he spent 13 years at Iowa State and won 10 Big 12 titles while at Iowa State. Before taking the position in Kansas State, he spent eight seasons as head coach at Iowa.

He inherited a program that went 14-22, with a 24-61 record in 2008-08. The Cyclones were bounced from the NCAA tournament in each of those seasons.

But Linn turned that up and stayed until this season. He also steered the Cyclones to a share of the Big 12 title (his second since taking the seat) in 2005. Linn became the all-time wins leader at Iowa State after the Cyclones went 16-18 in 2015-16.

Linn, who won Big 12 Coach of the Year honors in 2014 after coaching Iowa State to its second straight Big 12 Tournament championship, was named to the CollegeInsider.com National Coach of the Year list this season. He's also a finalist for the Walter Jay Pearson Award, given to the nation's top football coach.

Linn is the second college basketball coach to be named Kansas State coach. Brad Underwood was picked to replace Bruce Weber, who left for South Dakota in December. Underwood also guided Wichita State to three straight NCAA tournaments, including victories in 1997 and 1999.
