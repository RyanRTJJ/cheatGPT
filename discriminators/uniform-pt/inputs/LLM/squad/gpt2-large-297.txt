 Vedder's band The Matadors was the first band to use the recordings to produce a live product. (In addition to the Matadors, Milt Gabler recorded with a succession of others: the Muffin Boys, The Dixie Dregs, the Stilettos, The Knack, the New Breeders, the Black Keys, the Four Seasons, the All-American Rejects, the Gals, the Shuttles, the Rascals, and, at the end of the session, with Pearl Jam.) The recordings were recorded on two sides of wax, one for playback and a second for storage. (The Matadors didn't release their albums until early in the 1990s.)

The discs were recorded under a limited contract, meaning they would often be released only in Japan. (To this day, Japanese publishers refuse to provide discs that are not made in Japan.) In later years, Milt Gabler arranged the releases for various international labels, but, by the 1950s, each company was taking its own turns. The result was a mixed harvest: Most releases were limited to about 750 copies; most records were released in small batches; and, especially for the first ten years of release, many of the records seemed to come out just as a Japanese label's releases—a result of the "Japano" term being used in several countries for releases by Japanese record companies.

In order to deal with the demand for shorter and more affordable records, several other labels in Europe were also offering short-run, limited-run releases in 1953 and 1959. These included the New York Dolls, the Raggedy Anns, the Kinks, and the Beach Boys.

The first release in 1953 by the New York Dolls was a very modestly priced 35-inch single—a new product at the time, having been introduced in 1949. To promote the single, the band did what bands were wont to do.
