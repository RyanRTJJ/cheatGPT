. A neutral section serves to separate the flow from each of the supply lines fed from the different feeder stations.
The neutral section is fed with the neutral supply from a neutral zone to which the main section has access. In this case the main section is the connection line from the main station to the neutral zone. It will be appreciated that the flow flow from each feeder station passes through the neutral section when it enters the main section. During the start-up of a large power station or an installation there occurs the so-called "neutral zone" wherein the main section is at zero potential whereas the neutral zone is at a high potential. Neutral section switches are provided to disconnect power circuits from the neutral zone. After a start-up the neutral section is set at the same potential by a neutral zone adjustment system.
In a typical power station the total power station capacity can be very large. This capacity can be very large because of the very high efficiency of fossil fuel power plants. Thus, all fossil fuels, namely coal, oil, gas, etc., are combusted to generate sufficient heat for the plant operation. One means of improving the energy efficiency of a plant is thus to burn as little of the fossil fuel as possible.
Due to the high environmental effects of the use of fossil fuels, alternative sources of energy are being developed. Thus, as a result of the research efforts presently being pursued, there is interest in renewable energy sources.
In particular, wind power is a renewable source of energy. It is becoming increasingly important to supply the electricity demand of the region with power from renewable sources. It is desirable, therefore, to produce as much power from renewable sources as possible.
This can involve a multiplicity of different installations. In
