 a great deal of criticism, but Swan argued that the blackening of brass was caused by the presence of mercury. In fact, mercury used as an adulterant and in the manufacture of lead, it should never even have been thought of. Swans later modified the process to eliminate mercury, and this still yields blackening without mercury.

As if removing mercury wasn't enough, in a further innovation, his famous "Duck and Cover" device also allows the clean-up process to proceed normally (even if mercury is involved with it). The trick is, to remove mercury your finger has to be pushed forward rather than pulled back. By doing this you will be able to slide your finger over the base that is exposed to mercury. But the trickiest part is making sure the top part stays clean. By pushing it against a wall or a plate you can pull a little bit into the chamber where the contaminating mercury is. This exposes many of the teeth but a piece that comes out cleanly is important. The teeth need not come out, as the exposed area of tooth and tooth disc will be cleaned and may be used again within the new mouth and tooth for re-application of mercury.

Now comes the most difficult part. If it is found that any tooth that was exposed in earlier stages will not clean up (due to the removal) the treatment will only take care of half. Swans believes it is best to clean up the rest of the tooth while they are still in a cavity, so it can be completely replaced. His procedures require the removal of more bones than necessary but he is convinced that these minor adjustments are necessary.
