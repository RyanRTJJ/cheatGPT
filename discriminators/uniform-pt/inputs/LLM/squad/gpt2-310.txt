 the northwest of central and southern Switzerland; the Swiss Alps and the Alps of northern central Switzerland on the north and south sides of the Alps; and the highlands of the Alps and Alpine valleys on the south. At the eastmost point of the topographical range lies three main points of interest: the Swiss Ruhr valley to the north and the Caiad Forest on the eastward side of the Swiss Ruhr. At the central and southwestern points of the topography are two main valleys. The upper mountains of the Ruhr are mainly dominated by the Nansen valley towards the north, and the Alsace valley to the southwest. The most important part of the Ruhr in this area lies on the north side of the Alpine mountains near the German town of Genschen. The highest point of importance is the Kjart (the highest point of importance in this area), where the Alpine glaciers at the summit of the Kjart are located. These glaciers protect the highland and forest ranges of the Ruhr from glaciers which break off the river at the border of the valley. For the most part, the highland and forest ranges of the Ruhr are in the Caiad Forest south of the Caiad Mountain junction.

The major parts of the Ruhr, at least those of the North Face, of the highest points of the abovementioned topography have been occupied at Kjart; however, the Caiad Forest on the west and the Alsace River. This valley is surrounded by the Caiad Mountains, which extend from the central region of
