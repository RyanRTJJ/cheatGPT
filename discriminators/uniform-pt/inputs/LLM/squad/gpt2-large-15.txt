In fact, no parties have gained power within a US federal state since the founding of the republic more than in the late 19th century.

The main reason is the sheer difficulty of forming coalitions, but it's also because of ideological differences between the groups, differences that the parties are still struggling to resolve.

That challenge would no doubt be even more difficult if there were multiple parties in America. But today, there's more political room in the Republican Party.

That's because the state party system, for which the US is often stereotypically compared to countries like Japan and Canada, is dead in the US. And it's not a new development.
