 is likely to be very strongly negatively affected.

"Some of the potential effects on other species can be seen in the case (of a) large wolf or coyote population, but it is hard for biologists to know if all impacts could be avoided," says study authors and ecologist Dr Adam Pfeiffer.

To help answer the question of how much species would likely be affected, he and a group of colleagues studied the effects of the wolf population â€“ a subspecies of American wolf.

They used an extensive and complex system of predator detection cameras around the world to measure patterns of the frequency of wolf attacks in populations. These cameras capture specific details that allow biologists to determine whether a human may be present during an attack and determine whether humans are to blame for the attack.

The researchers determined that the Wolf Ecosystem Recovery, management and wildlife education program in South Africa saw a sharp drop in wolf attacks over the last decade. The authors have now compiled an electronic database of all incidents involving wolves in South Africa since 2009, based on the locations and dates of each attack.

As a result, the team is developing a tool that can help humans more easily spot wolves, which will then influence decisions to protect wildlife over the coming decades, and would help protect humans in the future.

Dr Pfeiffer explains that the researchers were particularly troubled that the vast majority of instances did not result in deaths for any of the animals attacked and therefore they did not consider the possibility that wolf attacks increase human conflict in the future.

"While they see very limited population recovery from recent wolf attacks, as a predator population grows they should consider
