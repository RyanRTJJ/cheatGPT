 39–38 BC, although this is controversial.[2][3] The Eclogues are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus.

Virgil wrote the Eclogues in the traditional Latin hexameter style, in which the lines consist of 6 feet, typically with a dactylic (one long and two short syllables) or a spondaic (two long syllables) meter. As a contemporary of Caesar and Nepos, Virgil was likely subject to their influence as it roamed through Rome during their lifetime as well. The influence of Catullus, Lucretius and Cicero on their work is also apparent in the writing of the Eclogues.

The Eclogues consist mainly of pastoral themes dealing with the pleasurable side of nature. The idealized shepherd and his love of the land are featured in most of the poems, and Virgil often uses the same shepherd for multiple poems. The language and attitude of the shepherd correlates to the speaker of Theocritus’s idylls. A number of the Eclogues (1, 4, 7, 8) experiment with poetic meter, including dactylic hexameter and use of assonance, which link them to both Virgil’s more pastoral poems and more sophisticated works, such as the Georgics. Although some of the poems are specific to Greek and Roman literary conventions, there is a great deal of sense of real pastoral life to the Eclogues. The traditional subjects of pastoral poetry—love, rural scenery, and idealized country life—are all addressed in the Eclogues. This
