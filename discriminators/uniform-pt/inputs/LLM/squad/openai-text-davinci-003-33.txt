Unstrut River. Moving south, the landscape changes to the hills and valleys of the Thuringian Forest, criss-crossed with river valleys and gorges. In the east is the flat North German Plain, and in the southwest is the Rh√∂n mountain range, a part of the Central Uplands. Thuringia also has several man-made lakes, some of which were created as a result of lignite strip mining.
