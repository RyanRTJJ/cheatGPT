Tropical/Atlantic Bluejays

Tropical Blue Jays live primarily on tropical islands with long warm winters. They are particularly common in the eastern Pacific, from Australia to the Philippines. In the United States, it is common not only in the southeast, but as far south as Texas. Since they are relatively large, these birds are also common bird feeders during summer. They seem to be a generalist, having been recorded at nesting sites on both the Pacific and Atlantic sides of the Atlantic. Their diet varies from small insects to fish, lizards, and birds. Their main prey of choice seem to be the young turtles of the genus Lutjanus, and many other large aquatic animals such as sea turtles, eels, and fish. Blue Jays are predators, yet their diet also includes birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians when these prey occur along the shoreline of their nesting islands.


In general, the diet of this bird is extremely varied and it seems that, during the long warm periods when all the species of life gather together at the same spot, a wide variety of small insects and birds are present feeding upon them. This behavior contrasts with the diets of other large tropical birds such as the Galapagos Tortoise and the Galapagos Tortoise, which seem to be largely composed of small insects and other animals that are easily trapped by a gizzard and eaten one after the other. The diet of the birds of the genus Caloplaca seems to be similar on
