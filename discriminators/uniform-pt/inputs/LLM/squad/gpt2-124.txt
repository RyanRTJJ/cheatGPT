Paris has since added the 2,500-capacity Eiffel Tower to the planned 500,000 square metre Olympic stadium. The new venue will also add capacity to a 20,000-strong indoor and outdoor complex as the capital faces the threat of a major storm.

The new stadiums are already being built in places such as Rennes, where crowds have been urged to come for pre-dawn showers to avoid damage to their local and international tourism sites.

The International Olympic Committee said it is working to ensure the new venues and equipment are ready for the 2020 Games in Rio de Janeiro.

Officials from several sports sectors are organising a joint event in the city to show support for these projects.

In July, athletes from the USA, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania were to arrive on the streets of major Olympic venues throughout the world to protest against the Olympics as well as the current state of affairs in Europe, the US and Canada.

It is also anticipated that in Europe, the Paris games will take place before the two events are over. The world was left wondering what to expect from the start of the Games, which are meant to start in 1872. But those concerns have been lifted as France will host a major political and military event on 27 April, marking the start of a new era of global politics.

The Olympics have been dubbed a "stadium des Olympices" by the IOC since its founding in 1924 and it was the first big sporting event since 1900.

The games, which feature a team of 11 national federations and will begin after the first round, were last held in 1912 but since then this has been the country's national sport.

The IOC hopes that this should be seen as a boost for its European partners and its European football partners, who have been battling it out for decades over their claim to the Champions League.
