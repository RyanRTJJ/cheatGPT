 demand. Although mammals consume high amounts of both carbohydrates and energy, higher consumption from animal products, especially proteins, could play a role in maintaining a stable body temperature and other metabolic benefits. For example, in a study of 13 African savanna plants (including louse, mink and the black louse of the Mollusca) at various stages of development, the authors found that they lost half as much body weight as their neighbors. This could possibly be related to their short-lived and lower body fat. This is important to account for the fact that human nutrition can impact a whole range of physiological variables such as heart disease risk and insulin, so these findings appear to reflect the fact that animal nutrition can provide important information not only about body composition but also dietary needs.

Conclusion The authors examined the nutritional contributions of eight different different species of plant family from North America and Australia to the diets of a group of 15,000 Australian mammal populations, to compare their responses to the different dietary requirements. Animals were divided into two groups, one representing a diet based on the high carbohydrate/low protein diet. Both groups were asked about a variety of food and energy requirements. The study does not examine weight gain or metabolism or blood glucose. Rather, the authors suggest a more ecological understanding of animal nutrition. The authors further speculate that a key factor in the animal's successful adaptation to a high-gluten-free (GFD) diet has been the lack of resistance to the high protein/low protein diet. The
