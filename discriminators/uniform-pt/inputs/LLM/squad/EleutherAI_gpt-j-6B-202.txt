By making salvation dependent on the merits of works, Luther and his followers were in danger of losing the Christian heritage without which there is no real salvation at all ([@r14]). This was one of the issues they discussed at the diet of Worms in 1521, where they argued that the pope's authority derived from the "Holy Scriptures, the apostles, and Christ himself."

Protestants took this struggle more seriously than Catholics because the Reformation had a stronger theological foundation and was more strongly connected with their conscience. Lutherans, who could not accept that the Roman church was the true church of Christ ([@r11]), were the first to protest.
