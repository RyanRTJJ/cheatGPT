 educational system and an Islamic legal code for Islamic rulers. These schools were also places of learning where Arabic had its own written grammar, semantics and lexicon.

The most important centers for madaristic learning during the Ottoman period were the famous centers of the University of Istanbul, the University of Izmir, and the Turkish University of the Middle East at Ankara. As the Islamic sciences grew in both power and prestige during the Ottoman period, madurism became in this context a way to bridge the gap between the Islamic world and the West. For example, Ibn Abi Hatim, one of the greatest Islamic scholars of the 18th century, taught himself Arabic as early as 1390 in order to receive the translation of the Quran from the Arabic-speaking scholar Abu Ya'la al-Ashari ("The Prophet's Teacher". ) During the Ottoman period, the study of Arabic with madarism at its heart has been one of the most visible expressions between the Islamic world and the West. Many Muslims in the West still prefer to learn Arabic with madarism. For example, the "Qur'an in Arabic" courses in the U.S. have been a huge success for madarism among many students.

Today, madarism has a much diminished presence in the world of Middle Eastern studies. The reason why the madaria was born out of a practical need was rooted in the economic and political conditions during the Ottoman era. During this period of rapid development in Middle Eastern economy and culture, the madaris suffered from a shortage of students. The madaris were forced to create alternative training programs that allowed qualified students to study the sciences in a specialized manner at local universities. In addition, the Ottoman madaris also created a public service and academic education institution called the Fethullah Gülen University (Hekmet-i Gülen), which functioned for more than twenty years in Turkey.
