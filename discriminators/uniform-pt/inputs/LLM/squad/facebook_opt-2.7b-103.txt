 the first baronet. He remained out of Parliament while he continued to support the Whigs. He took part in the Whig Party Conference held at Portsmouth on 3 July 1794 and spoke against the dissolution of the Whig Party, but this was not enough to win him a seat and he returned to London from Hampshire. This made him the first person from Hampshire to represent one House of Parliament. In 1801 he was returned to Parliament once again, as MP for Great Belford, before being a candidate at the 1820 General Election for a seat at the newly created seat of Ashburton, in Lincolnshire. The election came as a surprise to him and he lost the seat.

He was succeeded as MP for Ashburton by William Whalley.

Burke died at his seat in 1804 and was buried in Ashburton.
