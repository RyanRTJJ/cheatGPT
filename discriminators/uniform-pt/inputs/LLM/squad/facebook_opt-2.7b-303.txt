They had been arrested during a nationwide manhunt, although nearly all were later acquitted after legal proceedings in their home States. Yet many were still denied citizenship and subsequently barred from public life. As a consequence, many of them were forced into menial labour on public works projects for the American Government. These were often sites of poor conditions, and the employees of these works, the Japanese Americans, faced severe prejudice. (This is similar to the situation facing African Americans during segregation and discrimination earlier in the 20th century in the United States. The denial of citizenship status and subsequent social marginalisation and isolation was later the subject of legal challenge.)

During 1941-44, the Japanese American Citizens League and other organisations organised a demonstration against the incarceration system.
