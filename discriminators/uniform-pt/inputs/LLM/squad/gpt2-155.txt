The store in Midland Plaza Park

The Midland Plaza Plaza is one of Chicago's top shopping districts in the city. The Plaza is located in the city center in the heart of East St. Paul.

There is two major shopping lots: the Market Street and Main Street Shopping Complex. The top of the Market Street lot can accommodate multiple categories of clothes, eyeglasses and accessories. The Main Street lot holds the shopping center, and is used to train for train.

During WWI, a new building on the corner of Market Street and Main Street was designed by the General Dynamics company to be an industrial site. After WWII, the building was purchased by The City Council, which later owned.

In 1937, the North Station opened in the new store building. During World War II, the store was renamed the Main Street store.

North Station was one of the largest retailers in the country. It was also the best place to hang out during daytime.

While many of the store's amenities may be similar to that of a traditional shopping center located on Main St., some have unique features. Most of the stores are also easily accessible from North Station.
