 while the plumage that would be used after moulting is the "breeding" plumage. As the birds change their plumage, they leave behind the feathers used for their body, making their wings and legs longer in order to increase the size and buoyancy of their gizzards and stomachs. There are six stages of plumage moult: (1) basal, (2) pre-moulting, (3) early-moulting, (4) early-to-late-moulting, (5) late-to-late-moulting, and (6) post-moulting. The non-breeding stage is typically a year or two before mating begins, while the breeding stage often occurs in the spring after the female has mated. The breeding stage is the one with the longest moult time and is usually more than a year. This moult is done primarily to rid feathers of dead skin, hair, scales, and other impurities that accumulate on and around the bird during normal life. There is still a risk of feather loss during this moult process because some birds have "super-feathers" which can cover up the bird's normal down feathers with thick, black feathers that have a great deal of strength. This extra strength can cause feathers to break when being stretched. Feathers are also often worn by the birds as they fly.

Moults happen a little bit every year. Usually the molt process happens approximately three times at five day intervals, but can occur at shorter intervals. Mice have a tendency to moult more quickly once a year. Merely flying is enough to cause the down to be stripped and the feathers to fall out.

The moulting of feathers is a very large project for a male bird. It involves not only feather loss but
