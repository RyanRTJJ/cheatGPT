Frog or Toad Plumage

Both frogs and toads have a non-breeding plumage consisting of a pattern of white scales on an otherwise brown or tan background. In some frogs, the skin is black or brownish. In some toads, the skin is white.

Several ornamental plants such as maples, birches, pines, and beech produce a reddish-purple or pinkish-purple coloring, while other plant species such as birch, dogwood, hickory, sycamore, and wisteria produce bright shades of orange, red, and orange-red. Some of the more colorful bird plumage includes blue, green, red, yellow, orange, red and pink, and cream.

Because the leaves remain bright green as long as the plant is in bloom, color-changing chrysanthemums offer a good compromise between the attractiveness of the flowers and the usefulness of the plant's leaves. Chrysanthemums also produce a high percentage of seeds, so color-changer chrysanthemums often grow in small clusters around flowers and in the ground.

Camellia

Camellia may produce a variety of colors depending upon how it blooms. When the plant blooms, it forms small flowers with clusters of small, red or purple flowers known as an "arabian blossom." Then, the cluster of flowers will turn into a large bush of
