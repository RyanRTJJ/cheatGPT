 more exclusive highlights of the cup games. The BBC in some years had a number of pre-match shows which broadcast interviews, statistics and analysis from around the grounds before kick-off (with the BBC being one of the first football broadcasters in the world to bring out statistics on live-televised football games). The BBC also continued the broadcasting of the BBC Test Match Special from 1950 until 2000 and hosted a series of football related sports programmes and the annual charity game "Great Expectations", featuring the teams of England national men's and women's teams, the Olympic and world snooker teams.

In 2004, following the BBC's involvement in UEFA's European football competition the Champions League the BBC began providing studio coverage of the games for Sky, with David Bond.
Along with their other regular match highlights, match highlights from the 2005â€“06 football season were shown on Match of the Day, alongside a full match from the 2006 FIFA World Cup; this was also the first international game to show on Match of the Day.

From September 2009, a Football Focus strand developed with a BBC News presenter who provides analysis of each day's headlines and news stories of major international news. The Football Focus strand ended in June 2010, with BBC's coverage of major football games now broadcast as separate pieces in the same format as regular Match of the Day bulletins, and with the Football Focus presenter returning to BBC Radio Five Live rather than his duties in BBC Sport.

Sky Television broadcasts a dedicated afternoon kick-off report, Sky Sports News, which is updated throughout the evening. Sky also produces and broadcasts The Football Show,
