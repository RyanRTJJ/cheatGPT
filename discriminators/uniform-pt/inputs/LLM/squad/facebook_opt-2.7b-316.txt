 butterflies can change colour in such a way as to reflect the polarization of the light striking the antennae. Insects that perceive sound also use sophisticated antennae to detect the direction of an insect that sounds by the same system.
In contrast, insect eyes, as seen on land, are conventionally made of simple lenses and have nothing like the sensitivity of a bee's eyes. These lenses are able to focus the reflected light on a retina, thus forming a picture. Insects, however, can detect colours even though reflected light from these eyes does not reflect in a specific colour, and they can detect the polarization of the light reflected from their eyes. Therefore, they presumably could also detect sound and could respond to the direction of sound.
As can be seen, there are remarkable similarities between insect eyes and human eyes. It is therefore puzzling that insects use this sophisticated and highly sensitive array of specialised organs in just one area. Thus, there is a need in the art to provide novel insect eye designs that function in various ways. There is a further need to provide novel eye designs that sense the direction of sound and/or light while avoiding detection of those sensory modalities that serve very little in guiding a flying insect. Another reason for the need was to be able to provide for more flexible structures than were available in the art.
Moreover, it is quite
