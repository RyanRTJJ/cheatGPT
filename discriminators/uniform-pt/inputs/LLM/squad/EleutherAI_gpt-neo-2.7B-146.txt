 transition from original Intel chips (PowerPC to PowerPC, and Intel to Intel, in this sense, though not the way we call the latter transition a transition). You can see the transition by trying to run the Windows 98-era Boot Camp. The Windows 98-era boot menu only allows PowerPC or Intel chips that use a different register address space from x86 or ARM processors.

To say that Intel is using a hybrid architecture is like saying a modern car uses a hybrid technology (the idea that a car uses a technology that was designed for one car but was applied to a different car) so what we are doing in talking about hybrid architectures is distinguishing a hybrid from an integrated chip implementation. The Intel x86 processor was developed in such a way that it did not just integrate a new type of power, but in a hybrid fashion it integrated both the CPU and the bus so that at the hardware level the combination of hardware and software has the properties of both integrated and hybrid (in which the software implements some parts of both the CPU and Busses architecture without any hardware in between). To be more specific we call it hybrid architecture and the Intel x86 the Intel 32-bit microarchitecture. The other processor families we call them hybrid because to their specifications the Intel architectures include a small piece that is not the same for each of the families. There is a long thread on SO by Bob Brown who claims that the performance of the Intel Core
