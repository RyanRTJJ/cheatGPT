iang River at 10:00 on September 6, 1941 in the most disastrous of defeats.  Japanese losses ran into the hundreds of thousands.  Only a week earlier, the 3rd Division had defeated a major Allied airborne force in the battle for Nanjing, killing 9,000 out of 40,000 soldiers.

Battle
The Japanese planned to capture the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Marine Corps Divisions in order to break through the Allied rear and take Nanjing. On August 28, the 3rd Division was at Lingjing, the division's major base of supplies. On August 31, the division crossed the Chang'an River at the Chang'an Bridgehead and advanced to Yongfang County. On September 1, a small, but extremely demoralized, force of 5,000 Japanese attacked several Allied dugouts but had no response from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Corps who remained behind in Lingjing. The 3rd Division moved to Yongjie, the Japanese headquarters. On September 5, the 3rd Division crossed the Tsingtao River, and five days later, under Lieutenant General Shigeru Yoshida, the 3rd Division moved to Yan'an. On September 8, 1945, the 3rd Division received the surrender of the Allied 1st, 2nd and 3rd Marine Corps Divisions.

Recapitalization
Following the surrender, the 3rd Division was not immediately repounded. In October, the newly reorganized 2nd Division replaced the unit until the 3rd Division received its full strength on November 1, 1945, when the unit was reestablished at Pingxiang in Jiangxi province. On June 13, 1946, the 3rd Division was moved in to defend the town of Xiangxi. During the battle of Xiangxi, after the 3rd Division seized the village of Longwang, the Japanese 6th Division began an assault on the Division. After the Japanese capture the Longwang village, the Japanese 6th Division attacked Pingxiang but were unable to gain any ground, although they lost some of their troops during the battle. The 3rd Division finally captured Xiangxi with the help of the Chinese 4th Corps on October 4, 1946.
