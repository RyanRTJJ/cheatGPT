 a religious office is not the same as an official post in any institution of state. This is an important distinction. While the latter makes a priest a member of the state, this distinction makes his political allegiance to a religious party impossible.

Under the secular constitution, this power of religious party status is exercised by the Christian right and its successor, the Lutheran-Catholic League (Jörg von Bircher). However, the Lutheran-Catholic League has, at present, no representative role in governmental or popular institutions, nor are they engaged in activities which tend to interfere with legislative, judicial or economic functions.
