 of cultural studies found its main inspiration in the French existentialist philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre. He, in turn, had been influenced by Benjamin Britten's operas, and the playwriting of the American critic Edward Albee.

Later history

The movement's growth in the United States coincided with its rise abroad. In 1948, Walter Benjamin visited the US, and, upon his return to Germany, was impressed by a wave of intellectual activity:

In 1951, the American cultural critic Roger McNeer published The Culture of Critique: American Social Thought Before Post-WWII. The English translator of this book, Philip Lang, published three volumes in 1955:

 Critical Essays: A Critical Approach to Contemporary Culture
 The Collected Critical Essays of Roger McNeer
 The Collected Critical Essays of Philip Lang: Part IV: Social Theory

From his own works, McNeer learned more deeply about the impact British post-World War II British cultural criticism had on the American establishment: he remarked that there was an "excellent correlation [...] between British attitudes, ideas and concepts and those of the American elite". In a 1955 review of the first volume, American critic Donald Davidson wrote that "McNeer's book marks a significant advance in American cultural understanding" and that he had "expanded the circle of literary and social criticism that might be considered a social scientific approach".

In his next work, McNeer published The Culture of Critique: American Social Thought After 1947. The volume was in production for 18 years: "There was more than a five-year hiatus [...] during which [...] McNeer lived with his second wife in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In that time the two books were never published" and was finally published in 1995 by University of California Press.

McNeer's two volume work was translated into German in 1959
