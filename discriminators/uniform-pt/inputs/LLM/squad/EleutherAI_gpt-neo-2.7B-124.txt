"The Lord has chosen Jerusalem as the capital of all Israel" (Isa. 2:4).

We had set off for Jerusalem on the morning of June 10, the Friday after the Feast of Pentecost, heading down the coast in a convoy of Israeli and American and British fighter and bomber aircraft, and by day-trip buses and cars with our three children and the nanny.

The drivers in the back of the bus, and the passengers in the front, sat motionless, staring, while the driver, his arms flailing wildly, shouted, "Allah, Allah, Allah! _Allah_ in _Allahu Akbar!_ " This continued for a moment or two. And then the driver yelled again: " _Allah_ in _Allahu Akbar!_ " And so it was with the car. And with each successive shout in Arabic, we would respond from the back seat, " _Allahu Akbar_," and then in English, " _Jesus_, _Jesus_, _Jesus_," until the car took off with a roar of wind and engine. " _Allahu Akbar!_ " the driver screamed from the back. " _Allahu Akbar_! _Allah_ in _Allahu Akbar!_ " And with each shout, Jesus had become more and more clearly a Christian, almost as though he were there, watching and listening.

If it was an effort for the driver to control the speeding car, it was equally onerous
