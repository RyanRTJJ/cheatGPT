Chinese and Japanese troops fought alongside each other, but there were no formal fighting rules between each other and most of the engagements with Chinese troops took place in a 'blind' firefight. This 'blind battle' meant that the Japanese would kill both Chinese and Manchurian forces in one fell swoop while the Chinese would kill only the few Japanese themselves.


After the Battle of Shanghai in 1380 the two armies were reunited and China would gain the position that was originally taken by Japan in that battle.[39]


The Battle of Waterloo


Another clash between China and Japan was at Waterloo on June 6, 1914. The war that was about to start between these two countries was still in the infancy stage and the two armies were no closer to a peace agreement than they had been before the war started; there had been an agreement in principle as to where the battlefields of modern war would be in a future peace treaty, but the two powers had remained at an impasse about the actual location where an attack on the other would be made.


After this, the Japanese army came to regard the war as their victory; it was the battle that they were most proud and that they believed would be more satisfying and winnable, so for them it was the decisive victory, the first of the "Battle of Osaka, A.D. 1894" for them.[40]


Despite a war that lasted seven years; one in which over 100,000 Japanese died, not a single combatant had to be killed; the number of casualties in this very short war could be seen in the destruction of China's major cities, as well as the devastation in China of many of the major cities of the Empire.


After the Battle of Waterloo the battle is generally credited as the first decisive battle of World War I which led to the outbreak of the war. However, it had an antecedent in the Battle of Wulong in the Shanxi province of China that had taken place just a year before.


The Chinese Empire's southern border was under Mongol occupation by the Mongols. In 1260, a Mongol army under Genghis Khan defeated the Chinese at Wulong; this would become the basis for the First Sino-Mongol War
