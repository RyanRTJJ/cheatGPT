d the Power Set.

The Deluxe Set, released in October 1985, was the first bundle to be released, and was the most comprehensive of the four options. It included: the R.O.B. (an accessory game robot), two game controllers, a Light Zapper light gun (for compatible games), a combination of Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt, and a NES Satellite that allowed for four-player simultaneous play.

The Control Deck was released a few months later in December 1985 and was a slightly cheaper option than the Deluxe Set. The Control Deck included: a NES control console, two controllers, and one of the games already released, usually either Super Mario Bros. or Duck Hunt (depending on the market).

The Action Set, released in the summer of 1987, was the mid-range option. It included theConsole, two controllers, a light gun, and two games (Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt).

The Power Set, released in 1989, was the most expensive option designed to capture increasingly more advanced gamers. It included the Console, two controllers, a Power Pad (a floor-based controller that allowed you to play running and fitness games with your feet) and the three games Super Mario Bros., Duck Hunt, and World Class Track Meet. All four bundles allowed you to play a wide variety of NES games.
