 an overall cost that can be estimated in billions of dollars. Since 1991, the school has raised its undergraduate tuition by more than two-thirds.

To fill many roles: the library, the academic center, the physical plant, the science center and a dozen other related departments and administrative buildings.

Each residential hall, which houses approximately 18,000 students, will require a renovation project that may total $100 million, according to the plan. In addition to the renovations, the school plans to replace all the walls on all floors with either energy-efficient materials or glass.

In 2007, the university raised more than $1 billion toward its "greening" projects, a program designed to turn over 1.2 million pounds of trash to landfill every year. It has become the largest in the United States.

"A lot of the construction is going to be done off-campus so that the site doesn't have to be shut down due to the construction," said University President Christopher Lartigue.

In addition, the school's student housing, an academic and business center, a science center, a music studio, a health center, two dining halls, an athletic facility, the basketball arena and an aquatics center.

Lartigue expects another $100 million in "construction savings" due to cost-cutting measures, including the elimination of 40 percent of the university's 7,000 parking spaces.

Many academic departments will also be undergoing major renovations. Most of the professors at the University of Alabama, for example, will retire and most of the school's 5,000 students will migrate from its three large-campus campuses into the smaller
