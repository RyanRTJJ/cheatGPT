 would then cause a permanent shift along the x-y plane. The theory was later extended by Jean-Paul Breguet and other French scientists in the 1920s and '30s; now the theory has been shown to be correct. As Breguet said: "The magnetic field is that which is produced when the electric potential difference between two electrically conductive substances vanishes and is made to expand; the result follows in accordance with both its physical law and with the law of the magnet." In the same way we can describe the changing of magnetic fields with the same reasoning as we described the spinning of wheels.

The effect isn't only the result of the effect itself, but also that of the magnetic polarity of the electron being on and off, and this polarity will depend on the state of the source of the source. If the source is static, which is why we turn the switch on when we want to rotate the wheel, the polarity will remain on (i.e, the electric potential difference between the metal particles is reversed) and if it is moving, the polarity will become on (-i) and vice versa (i = -f/F; +i = -f/F).

To understand the effect better, consider an arbitrary magnetic field such as the one on the outside of a coil being applied to a body. As long as the magnetic field isn't reversed, any magnetic body will be completely unaffected by the magnetic field and will behave almost exactly the same; however, as soon as the magnetic field is reversed, the body will rotate in an opposing direction so that it is now being pulled in the opposite direction.

As you can see, when the magnetic field is on (red), the electric field on the particle, which was always on (as you have seen, any body doesn't have a magnetic field), becomes off (green), and vice versa (blue).

And if we put the switching switch on, it will suddenly cease to make any difference whether the magnetic field is on the particle by itself (yellow) or is reversed on the particle, and vice versa (circled in blue and red, respectively). How can we explain this mysterious, but totally intuitive ability of all other forms of rotation (i
