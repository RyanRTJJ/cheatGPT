 certain fatty acids are essential, such as omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to support brain and immune function.

So while taking in plenty of fatty acids, some people may find that they don't necessarily satisfy their desire to consume more.

The solution? Add omega-3 fatty acids.

"Omega-3 is much more abundant in salmon than in other fish," says Paul Brantley, PhD, RD, CSO and national director of nutrition communications for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. "Salmon is a rich source of omega-3 fats and provides many of the health benefits associated with omega-3 fatty acids, including lowering coronary heart disease risk and helping to prevent cognitive decline."

Not only does taking omega-3s provide a nutritional boost--particularly during times of low appetite--but they also lower triglyceride levels. And, since triglycerides are one of the body's blood fat types, taking enough omega-3 fatty acids to keep those fat levels down could have broader effects than keeping triglyceride levels down alone, says Brantley.

"Omega-3 fatty acids are known to work by changing the triglyceride level in the blood," he says. "And triglycerides are known to play a role in diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and Alzheimer's disease. By lowering triglycerides, omega-3s are also known to influence our ability to manage our weight."

The good news is that Americans aren't short on fatty fish, since it ranks first in U.S. dietary source by far, Brantley says.

"Fish have also shown benefits for cardiovascular disease, including helping to lower
