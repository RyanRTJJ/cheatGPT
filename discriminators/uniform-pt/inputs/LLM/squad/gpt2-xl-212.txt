 team members.

"It was a great moment," American swimmer Ryan Lochte said on Monday evening.

For China, the torchbearer was not a member of its national equestrian team but a 17-year-old who belongs to the Beijing Youth Olympic Games and is taking part in Beijing 2022.

He is believed to have taken the throne from his father. China's state-run Xinhua news agency said the torch was presented to him from a group of 10 youth leaders.

The Games is China's first since it hosted the Summer Olympics in 2008, but it has been marred by controversy.

China's state-run newspapers, state-run television stations and other entities have been quick to criticize officials, with reports on corruption and mismanagement on show.

After the torchbearer made his bid for the 2023 games, one commentator said: "The torch's light does not bring the party's prestige but its tarnish. At the same time, it has made some people feel very nostalgic."

Lately the torch has taken a harder line, and in 2013 the Olympic organization banned several countries from taking part after bribery scandals.

But in a country where officials have often been held accountable for their actions, the torch will be carrying few political weight with many locals still not convinced Beijing should hold the Games despite China's promises to improve its treatment of the poor. The country has long held the dubious distinction of being the most corrupt country in Olympic history.
