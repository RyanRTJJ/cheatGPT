 First Temple, the kingdom was then divided amongst the ruling Philistine factions that were led by Uzziah and his sons. This allowed the Jews to establish a centralized authority to rule all of Jewish history by the time of Christ at the year 37C. (See below for more information on the history of Israel)

The Kingdom of Israel existed when Israel was founded under the Babylonian Empire (ca. 711BC) and the kingship of the Jewish People was established at about the year 449 in approximately 17C. This period called the Middle Kingdom of Israel is one of the most popular and well-known periods of history to be followed to see the rise of Jewish civilization as an independent political entity, but it was also a period of turmoil in its history as the ruling Kingdom of Judah came to power under Nebuchadnezzar II (ca. 586 to 586BC and 551 to 545B) of the Babylonian Empire (a precursor of the Roman Empire).

While the Babylonian Empire was divided into several kingdoms over 2,000 years, the Jewish people lived under seven separate kingdoms (the Sephararan kingdoms) until approximately 500BC when a dynasty of kings emerged, the Dynasty of David, who ruled from 711 to 634BC (the era of Jesus). This period is often referred to as the Golden Age of Israel and the period beginning in 634BC (554 to 546BC) is often referred to as the Kingdom of David
