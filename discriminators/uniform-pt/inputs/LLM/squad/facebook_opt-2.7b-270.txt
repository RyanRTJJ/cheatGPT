History

Manx is an ethnonym, referring to the Manx people who inhabited the islands before the Norman invasion. There are few records of the Manx people from before the Viking age. The Manx language was in use by the 15th century and by the 18th century, Norman law was used in Isle of Man, which was then part of the Kingdom of Scotland. In the second half of the 19th century, the English language was adopted and replaced the Manx language and by the 20th century the island had become part of the United Kingdom. Many Isle of Man-born people work in the United Kingdom, including in the NHS.

The Manx people had a presence in the region, particularly in southern Scotland. Evidence of their presence in Scotland dates from the 7th century with the discovery of stone rings  north of Aberdeen that were from the 5th–6th–7th centuries
