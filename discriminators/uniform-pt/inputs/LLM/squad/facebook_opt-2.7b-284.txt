 system. Energy is an important factor in the function of living systems and a critical step in the exchange and control of other chemicals and signals that regulate and modulate cellular activity. The balance of energy among processes and cells is the foundation of biology. Energy is the driving force that determines the expression of genes and biological function from generation to generation.

The energy in living organisms is composed of one form of energy, ATP, and another, ATP+H+ ATPase, one step above. ATP gives energy to a living organism by facilitating the production of a range of essential nucleic acids such as ribonucleic acid (RNA), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and other nucleic acids, as well as by enhancing the movement and chemical reactions in cells. ATP+H+ ATPase has evolved as a regulator of biological processes and, together with proteins, is responsible for many of the roles which enzymes play in energy metabolism. ATP+H+ ATPase is usually associated with the heart and skeletal muscle.

Energy (calculated as work times energy) is the energy used by a given organism to make and transport chemical substances in living matter. This energy is derived from the energy of atoms and molecules of atoms and molecules of atoms that are chemically related to the material. Energy is involved in the transfer of matter and energy from form or
