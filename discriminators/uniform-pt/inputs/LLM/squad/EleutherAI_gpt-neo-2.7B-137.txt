 Top made their debut with a Top Ten album, Burn, which also topped the Billboard 200 and was certified Platinum. The rockers' success was a watershed moment in their career, one that catapulted them into the mainstream. In short order, several of their contemporaries joined the fray, including Bruce Springsteen, Bruce Dickinson of Metallica, and Eric Church, who would top the rock charts for the next nine years with the title-conjuring hit single Jesus Is Magic (1992).

While the success stories can be told from first-hand accounts, what has remained a puzzle is the exact manner by which Cooper, Springsteen, and Dickinson became the heroes they are today.
