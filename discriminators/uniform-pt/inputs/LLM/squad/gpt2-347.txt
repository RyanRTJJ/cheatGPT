 daily tap water costs over six times as much as water taken in, and can be used as a source for drinking in public, has been controversial. We tested two alternatives and found that 6–8 glasses of water daily reduces water in the intestines and promotes healthy circulation and circulation in the body. In the presence of alcohol to counteract any additional water and alcohol to balance our diet and control for the effects of alcohol, we have no doubt that a large daily glass of 10–100 glasses of water daily can be justified.

In order to get an exact value for water from the environment, we have measured the pH or dissolved oxygen content of tap water samples with a standard pH scale. The pH range is 0–10 according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and can be found on www.epa.gov/index.htm. In general, the pH range from 8 to 16.0 is well below the normal range of the pH scale used for water health. This is in contrast to the pH 2.5 range used by most of industry practices, for which only a very small percentage of water is produced. In the present study, the same system was used to determine the pH of tap water using standardized pH scales. One such scale is the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) system with a scale for pH levels between 6 and 20 (see fig 1). By default, most of the water from one tap in a community is treated with chlorine. However, if too little chlorine was added to a sample, the water was not able to grow. The pH of water at one pH scale showed a pH of 11.6 (2.1, 3.6,
