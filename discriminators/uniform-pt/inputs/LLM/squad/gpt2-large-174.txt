 in the seventh century, there were attempts to justify as morally justifiable a practice that had formerly been condemned as sacrilege -- the canonization of saints. It is difficult to conceive, then, of a more pernicious perversion of Christian principles. It can even be said that, since the Church's first miracle, the Annunciation, in 539 C.E., the Church has become its own enemy.

This, in turn, has provoked a counter-revolution against the traditional anti-Communism, an aspect Dr. Wagner describes as "the greatest challenge faced in our time by the Christian world."

Dr. Wagner makes a persuasive case for the need and the desirability of "a war against religious fundamentalism," not merely in regard to the threat to the Christian religion and its teachings but also, he argues, in the most concrete sense.
