This is because American law now requires any organization to be both non-profit and a political party in order to be registered as a "registered association." Because of this, not everyone who wants to play the roles of a political consultant can be a Republican or a Democrat as, in addition to lobbying, they also have to maintain a "lobbying activities" profile on the site and submit their names to the Internal Revenue Service. As of 2009, there were over 1,600 registered associations in the United States with the official names of: American Association of Retired Persons, American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities, American Family Association, American Association of Justice, American Institute of Architects, American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), American People's Action Council (APAC), American Planning Association, American Public Health Association, American Schools of Oriental Research, American Society of Civil Engineers, American Society of Civil Engineers, American Society of Civil Engineering, American Tax Foundation, American Taxpayer Advisory Council, American Tobacco Institute, American Urban League, American Federation of Teachers, American Federation of Railroad Trainmen, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, American Labor Institute, American Legion, American Public Health Association, American Psychiatric Association, American Statistical Association, American Wood Council, American Association for Justice, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Bar Association, American Civil Liberties Union, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal
