The installation was a collaboration between Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Roger Lemerre, Andr√© Mare, and Alexandre Mercereau. It was one of the very first examples of Cubist architecture, comprising of a sunken central hall with an adjoining gallery, on a podium prepared for the Salon. The walls were covered with wicker-work and with painted pieces of material including cubes, circles, and pyramids.

The interior of the house was designed in a manner that reflected the concepts of the Cubist painters. It was designed to display the effects of the interplay between straight lines and curves, further emphasizing the idea of fragmentation inherent in the Cubist movement. The installation also included furniture created in the Cubist style, such as sideboards and chairs, all designed by Duchamp-Villon and Lemerre.

The Cubist House sparked interest from art critics and the wider public alike, and was a key factor in revitalizing contemporary architecture at the time. Despite the significant impact it had on modern art, the original installation was only temporary and dismantled shortly after the exhibition.

Today, Maison Cubiste is regarded as an important influence on modern architecture. Its influence can be seen in the works of various architects, including Le Corbusier and Mies Van der Rohe, who both embraced the concept of modularity (breaking down of space into distinct parts) in order to bring an organic unity to the whole. Despite its ephemeral nature, Maison Cubiste has been recognized as a milestone in the development of modern architecture and its lasting legacy is testament to its importance in the history of art.
