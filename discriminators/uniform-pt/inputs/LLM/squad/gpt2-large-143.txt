 late 1960s, three companies (Shure and Columbia, and Fender) pioneered record players incorporating new and exotic materials to achieve the "flexibility" that the 78 produced. Since 1979, these have been the only products that have been offered commercially, so the record must be played "un-crushable" if it is to retain its sound. The major problems with these materials are that they only withstand a few times without breaking, and then only when the record is completely struck from the head. This means that you must "crush" the record by breaking it rather than by being able to pick it apart into individual blocks.

Uncrude Records

If a metal record was intended for playing with the record player, it would have been crushed prior to its insertion into place in the record player. Unfortunately, the majority of the records made since 1981 were not designed to be inserted into the record player to play in this fashion. They are intended to be pressed. Because of the sheer number and variety of manufacturers and brands of uncoated records, and the fact that some designers did not realize, or could not understand, that they were uncoated records, there was a considerable number of records that are "impure" or may be more correctly labeled 'uncure' records. In 1982, Fender began advertising "uncoated" record players that were sold by third party dealers and/or other manufacturers. These are records that are supposed to have the same shape, but without the metal plate. For instance Fender would advertise their "100% pure silver" record players, but had to be careful when they made these claims because
