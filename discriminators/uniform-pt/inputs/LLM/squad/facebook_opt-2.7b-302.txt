 12 yards (11 m) wide. The field was originally designed by Gino Gatti of the Field Operations Corp. at a cost of $60,000. The field is an AstroTurf surface with artificial lighting and heated goal posts. The field is considered to be one of the best artificial fields in North America and is regarded to be one of two AstroTurfs used in the National Football League.[3]

After the 2006 Grey Cup game between the Edmonton Eskimos and Calgary Stampeders, CFL Commissioner Randy Ambrosie stated in an interview with the National Post that Calgary would host another Grey Cup game; the 2012 game.[2] On June 28, 2012, Calgary Stampeders owner Edward Young released the first image of the temporary grass field that will be installed at McMahon Stadium in 2013 as the stadium underwent renovations in preparation to host the 2011 Grey Cup.[5] The temporary grass field was installed just one year after the 2012 Grey Cup game was scheduled, but a field turf was never specified as part of the renovations.
