 had arrived in the summer of 1995 to replace departed legend Toni Mu√±oz. In his six seasons at Camp Nou, he had become an idol to Barcelona supporters, producing memorable displays and scoring important goals.

When Figo moved to Real Madrid in the summer of 2000, the transfer prompted a huge backlash among the fans, and his return with the Madrid side in 2001 was marred by hostility, with supporters responding with insults and throwing objects at the player. The episode caused a deep rift between fans and players, which had never been seen before in the history of the club.

This was the start of a new era for the club, one which saw its foundations shaken by the departure of its long-time legends. It also sparked a new sense of bitterness between supporters and players, one that still lingers today. The lesson from this episode is that the loyalty of fans should never be taken for granted, and that the figure of the president must always strive to bring the club and its supporters closer together.
