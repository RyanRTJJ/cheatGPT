c" plumage. In most species, the seasonal moult is triggered by the decreasing hours of daylight in the approach to winter.

Moulting of feathers is not a continuous process but one that involves stages. During the moult, the bird may be said to be "in moult". The pattern of moult or Phaeomelanin production can vary from species to species and often from individual birds to individuals. It may also vary from population to population. Moulting patterns are often related to the bird's age, breeding status and sex.

The frequency of moults can vary greatly but in species moulting more than once a year, the primary moult usually takes place shortly after the breeding season. This can be followed by a partial or complete moult several months later. In species with a single moult it generally takes place in the autumn. In some birds, moulting can be induced by changes in the proximate environment such as food availability or temperature.

The sequence of moulting is often extremely precise and can involve the shedding of single feathers or groups of feathers. Birds moult by replacing individual feathers at a time. For instance, most passerines moult either remiges (wing feathers) or rectrices (tail feathers) at a rate of one feather per feather tract (feather group). Some passerines such as songbirds moult tail feathers one at a time in a precisely determined order.
