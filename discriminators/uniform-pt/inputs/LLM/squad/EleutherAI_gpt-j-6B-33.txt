hausen, and the Hainich hill range. In Thuringia’s far south, the Saale river valley has vineyards and forests. In the west of the region, the Vogtland and the Thuringian Forest are separated by hilly landscapes of the Thuringian Birch Foreland.

The mountains in the far north are covered with forests:

Goldene Aue (“Golden Field”)

The most significant part of the Thuringian Landscape is the Goldene Aue (Golden field), a fertile plain created by the Saale and Hainich rivers after the last ice advance. The most impressive riverside landscapes are in the north-easternmost part of the field.

Saale river valley

South of the Goldene Aue, the Saale River runs through a picturesque valley over an agricultural area of wide vineyards and forests. The forests surrounding the Saale river are the habitat of the Thuringian Oak and Black Pine.

Hainich Hill Range

The Hainich hills are a rather homogeneous landscape. They are mostly covered by forests, or by moorland.

Vogtland

The northern part of the Vogtland is bordered by the Thuringian Forest. This area also has the most diverse habitat in Thuringia. Besides the Thuringian beech and the Black Pine, many other species of forests are living here, like the beech tree with its nuts. In some parts, there are coniferous and deciduous forests in a variety of different ages.

Saale river valley

The southern part of the Vogtland is the Saale river valley. In this agricultural landscape, many of the typical Thuringian farms are located. In the south-western part of the valley, farms stand on a relatively high plateau.

Thuringian Forelands

After the last ice advance of the most recent glacial epoch, the Goldene Aue formed the present-day Thuringian landscape. However, the climate had already been warmer during the previous ice age.
