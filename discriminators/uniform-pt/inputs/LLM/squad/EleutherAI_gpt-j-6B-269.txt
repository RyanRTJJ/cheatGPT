, situated in the area around Hidalgo del Parral and Juxtlahuaca, receives little more than 20 in (500 mm), although the eastern part of the basin, in the Tepalcatepec area, is the wettest part of the region since it receives annual precipitation ranging from around 100 in (2500 mm), to over 300 in (7500 mm) over the eastern part of that area. The most severe flooding from heavy rainfall events occurs on the eastern fringe, in the El Lázaro and Jalostotitlán areas, where annual rainfall exceeds 800 in (20,000 mm) on the eastern fringe of the basin. The region usually receives around 40 tropical cyclones annually, of which five tropical depressions form in the basin. Between October and November of each calendar year, the region sees a dry-season that lasts for several months. These dry seasons are preceded by the southern subtropical ridge, a semi-permanent low-pressure system in the central Pacific Ocean, while after the onset of the rainy season there is a high-pressure system over California that lasts until the dry season begins in the region.

Environment 
Most of the desert in the Rio Grande cut into the eastern fringe of the Chihuahuan Basin is at least 3,600 m above sea level (asl). Most major rivers, however, including the Río Bravo, Rio Grande, Tampico, Colorado, Santiago, and the Bavispe and San Juan rivers, drain from the mountains at over 4500 m asl, the highest peaks in the desert area on the border between Mexico and the US. The climate of northern and southern sections of the Chihuahuan Basin are cooler than in much of the country, because of their elevation. The average yearly temperature is around 16 °C (61 °F) and at higher elevations, the temperature is cooler. There are numerous water and wildlife refuges, most of them managed by the US-based Conservation and Environmental Science department within the Bureau of Land Management, which form part of the larger Rio Grande Wild Horse Range.

Vegetation in the desert is mostly sparse and consists of the common mesquite tree, which
