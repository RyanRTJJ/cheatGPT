 returned to the capital to demand the restoration of their authority. The King claimed sovereignty over the continent, and he dismissed the three generals. Shang Zhixin and Geng Zhongming immediately traveled to the Temple of Heaven to appeal to Heaven for help, but Geng Zhongming was shot by a local soldier, which in response caused a war with the neighboring state of T'ang.

When the Temple of Heaven was built, a large portion of the territory had already been converted to Buddhism. The Temple of Heaven had a unique role as a focal point for the three powers for the first time. By the fourteenth century, three of Heaven's sons, Zhong Ling, Shang Yang, and Shang Tz≈≠, had become powerful deities in their own right.

By this time, thousands of monks had been sent to Temple of Heaven to seek the advice of the Ancestral Demons and to learn how to cultivate themselves as a Buddha. Although they spent the most amount of time studying Buddhism, the most successful disciples practiced Taoism and also became great mystics.
