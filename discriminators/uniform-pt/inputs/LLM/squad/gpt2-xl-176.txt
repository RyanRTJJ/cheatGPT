All charges, except for the conspiracy charge, were dropped by prosecutors just before the trial was due to start. The remaining charges were dropped by prosecutor David Jamieson in October 2015.

Dinsmore stood trial with Holden, MacKenzie, Oakeshott and a fourth journalist, Stuart Kuttner. Holden was convicted by a jury and sentenced in September 2016 to 15 months in prison.
