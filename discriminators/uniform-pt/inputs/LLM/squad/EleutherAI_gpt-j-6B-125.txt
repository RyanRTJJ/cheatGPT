 one party, one has assumed that it is simply two different parties. But in fact the real parties consist of hundreds, if not thousands, of sub-parties, with many more than two, and the parties themselves are made up of people and groups who are members of more sub-parties. The different parties are more alike than a majority (conservative) of citizens of a free, competitive society would want to deny. So why do the citizens of the United States do it?

There are two reasons citizens do it, which might be more correctly termed'reasons' rather than reasons: the first is that there are deep, structural and personal reasons that have been going on that create the two-party system of today, not reasons that make the whole nation want to vote for a Republican or a Democrat; there are reasons that produce both parties, and only a small portion of citizens are aware of any reason that would favor a party. The second reason is not structural, but is personal. It will be helpful to explain some ideas first that could possibly lead to changes and reforms in our political system, so as to avoid mistakes that do not necessarily lead to improvements in political behavior and voting.

A political party is a group that agrees that one man should hold the power. Power corrupts people, and politicians are always tempted to use it, whether for their personal benefit or for the benefit of the party.
