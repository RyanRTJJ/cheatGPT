 a case like this, people have trouble producing fatty acids, and the more they try it, the more they tend to die. Fats are vital to us all, not just the average human individual, but to our whole community.

Fatty acids are the "natural" source of energy. In fact, we've been known to say that the idea that the body has something else to use as energy comes from a very simple fact: We have more energy than almost anything else on the planet, or even of any type. But even though fat is essential to every person's energy production, it is one of the easiest ways for a person to eat a low-fat diet. So, what's the point?

First of all, your body is just as good at storing energy as any other type of body. Second, and more important, you also have the ability to control the amount of fat you're eating, based on where it is, how much it is, and how much it's stored in your fat cells. Of course, if the body's making an excess of fat, it may be able to do whatever it wants with your fuel. If it's using more fat, it may be more effective in getting back on track. But you can easily add more fat by simply eating more of your lean-to-fat type of food.
