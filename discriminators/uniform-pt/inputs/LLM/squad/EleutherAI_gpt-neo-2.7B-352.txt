mon, and by having the characters of Digimon work together in a world where Digimon still exist and can be freed from their ordinary lives to live among other beings.

Following the defeat of Dr. Lightmon in the second series, the fourth series started its two year run on July 1, 2002, marking its first and only original net anime.

In 2008, two-year plans were announced for three more series. They were to be titled Second World (2008), The Rise of Rhea (2008), and Lost and Found (2008), respectively.

The two-year plans for the remaining series were then announced again, with the last one to be called The Rising of Rhea (2009), taking place in Rhea's story. No details on its plot were given by its producers. As of May 2012, no new series have been announced, and some have even said that the two-year plans were still open for new episodes to be produced and released in 2009.

In 2014, Digimon Tamers writer Ken Fude wrote a book and released a short story of the series, titled A Long Way to Digital Island, but it was removed from the internet within months.[3] In 2015, there were reports that the three new episodes will be coming around the same time as The World Tree, the second episode of the third season of Digimon Frontier. The premiere of The World Tree was later announced and a teaser trailer was released on the web.

The New Digital World was first announced about six months prior to the series premiere, on April 3, 2009.
