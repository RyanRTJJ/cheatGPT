 Understanding[3], he said: "If then the earth has been first divided into two parts and inhabited with animals, or if there have been at the same time two kinds of women, men are in each part. If therefore then there be a division of life into one subject matter and another, this is a difference from the nature of the species, and cannot be admitted except upon evidence."[4]

In his response to Locke, he stated: "We must not conceive, as we did formerly, that a man made his part of animal life, and that it is a part of animals or of women. It is indeed quite plain that that is the original species, and that the same are two species, and that it is not lawful to divide animal or vegetal flesh into subjects and objects; for the reason that we cannot regard the living being that is made by the will and intellect of either man or beast."[5]

However his ideas, whether "contenuity" (a term similar to "diffusion") or not, have remained to be established.

The "contenuity" or the distinction which was maintained at the time, does not apply today. Since when are two different things supposed to be equivalent to one? This is a big problem, especially with ideas like this that were established in our time.
