 flags and then removed by fans after their flag was burned.

The torch was then set aloft by fans at the AT&T Park at about 3:30 pm at a press conference hosted by the U.S. Olympic Committee.

"The torch was lifted after approximately one hour of being burned," said Garett.

At least 27 people were killed in Chinese-language media reports in Beijing, in light of violent unrest following the funeral of pro-democracy activists Liu Xiaobo, 71, and her husband, Tiananmen. One of the dead was Kim Duk Yung, the former chief of political bureau Tsinghua University, who said he was a participant in the protests, citing news reports that said the university had carried out the funeral of Liu Xiaobo along with other officials who had joined the demonstrations.

During Wednesday's ceremony, a spokesman for the government in Beijing said it was continuing dialogue with the opposition during the funeral ceremony, but said people were expected to take the decision.

At least three protesters, who were involved in the protests on a recent day, were hospitalized and were being treated by emergency medical care on the scene. Police detained one of the protesters who was also detained in another group of protesters, but he was not arrested as an individual.

Demonstrators outside the Olympic Stadium in London had posted on China's official websites several photos of Chinese national fans celebrating the event, with one of the players holding a torch with Chinese and U.S. flags and another holding a banner that said "Our country. We are not against the United States. If we can't even find a good relationship with China, we'll do whatever we can to help it."
