 to localities including Buxtehude, Reutlinger Land, the Erzgebirge, and Saale-Erft, and a regional railway link was laid in Lettow-Wertheim. By 1939 the entire state rail network was nationalised.

From the end of World War II onwards, many branches and isolated lines were closed because of insufficient ridership. The main lines of the State Railway were taken over by the State Railways of West Germany (Bundesbahn) in 1950, and the lines that were then used by interregional services were taken over by the East German state railway system (SED). The intercity rail system was opened on 1 December 1961, when the former eastern state railways lines were nationalised.

The network consists of two parallel broad gauge main lines from Hanover to Kassel (both electrified in 1983) and Mainz (at least partially electrified and extended). A branch line from Nürtingen to Berlin is also under consideration for replacement in the long term. The line to Leipzig-Erfurt is mainly electrified. The line to Stuttgart-Baden-Baden is not electrified. There is a single narrow gauge line in North Thuringia between Buxtehude and Eisenach. An industrial railway is used from Erfurt to Kassel. No inter-state or intra-state passenger trains currently run along the mainline rail network.

History

Railway building

The first railways in Thuringia started with the opening of the Dörfel Railway between Eisenach and Erfurt on 3 October 1840, when a second route to Lettow-Wertheim was opened. The first Thuringian railway tunnel was opened in March 1850 through Döberitz. The following year, the Eisenach-Barmbek Railway was opened, while an inner ring road in Berlin began to be built. In the following years, a new railway towards Erfurt had been planned but cancelled before completion. The Barmbek Railway was later opened, which later on became the Erste Group's Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft
