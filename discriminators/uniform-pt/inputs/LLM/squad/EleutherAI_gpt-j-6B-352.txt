 evolution. Instead of relying on the original characters, a new cast of twelve Digimon is introduced. In an attempt to give the series a fresh start, a fresh Digimon spirit evolves every week, which has two effects - it creates a new Digimon with strange powers known as “monk” Digimon, and it raises the Digi-Egg, which the main characters can take turns to use to level up.

I'm not sure if I'm entirely into this idea; I'm more excited about the anime series that's making it's return, but if this series becomes a success, I might just end up supporting it for the new series.

Since the first announcement was over three and a half years ago, it's great that the Digimon World ReMix website finally updated to reflect the upcoming release of Digimon Adventure Digimon World ReMIX. The new website has a new layout, where you're able to not only view previously released Digimon video clips, but you can also purchase downloadable versions of those clips from their website.

Digimon World ReMIX will be released physically and digitally on July 30, 2008. There will be two editions - the regular edition, and a Digi-Style edition, which will include a limited edition digipak and a special Digifie card. The first batch of digi cards will be available for sale at the Digi-Style shop, which will be opening May 23rd in Akihabara, but if you're interested in grabbing one for yourself today, you can order it from Japan with a limited edition pack by sending them an e-mail directly
