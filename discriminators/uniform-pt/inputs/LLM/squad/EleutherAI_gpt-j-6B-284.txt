. Energy is also required in all other life processes, including respiration, circulation of blood, locomotion, muscular movement, nerve conduction and the central nervous system, and the biochemical processes of all cells. It is the major determinant in the growth of organisms, the movement of atoms and molecules within cells and in biological organization at all levels. It maintains biological equilibrium, and is therefore vital to life.

Biologists study energy metabolism by considering either the consumption or the production of energy, the first being called energy budget, and the latter being thermodynamics. Since the biosphere contains energy of all forms, a unified approach is considered in many fields, which makes use of energy to understand life. Such unifying themes as “energy of order” and “energy of life” were proposed by Erwin Schrödinger

Energy is any physical property of matter and all physical systems that can be transferred to do work. The basic property of energy is the ability to do work by producing forces or effects, such as heat, sound or motion. These forces or effects can produce useful work, such as the lifting of weights, motion of objects or the propulsion of a boat, vehicle, or aircraft, or they can exert force or do work against someone, such as push or pull on a muscle, exerting stress on a bone
