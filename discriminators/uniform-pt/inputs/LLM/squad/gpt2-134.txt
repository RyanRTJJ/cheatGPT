"Every group or organization was attacked, including some within the movement itself," said Anson Zavala, co-leader of the Hong Kong Alliance, who left the city shortly after the demonstration. "It is all true for everyone."

As protest activity has intensified, police have increased patrols of the city's busiest public transport platforms, police said.

A "new road" is being built for people to cross at different time points every few hours.

People were asked to wait until evening on the city's night bus to enter to get to their destination, and buses will now operate 24 hours a day.

People who want to avoid making the journey to work or work to earn an average of between HK$1,500 and $2,500 will be able to do so at two hours a day.

The first train will be operating Saturday morning before finishing at 9pm, and the second at 2am.

The government has called for the construction of a new rail link between the city and the mainland to allow more people to exercise their rights, at a cost to public works.

There is also an offer for drivers to operate all day, at peak times and to allow passengers on holiday to be caught for hours on ends.

There was also an appeal to stop driving before 5am on Tuesday.

Some of the protesters were detained and the two arrested on Wednesday at Hong Kong's busiest public transport platform. They have been released.
