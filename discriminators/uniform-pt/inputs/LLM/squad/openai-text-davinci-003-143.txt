This was followed in 1929 by the production of records made of glass by the Crystalophone Co. and, in 1932, by the introduction of the Quadradisc records which were made of composite aluminum foil, resin and wax paper.

While these records were not mass-produced, they are sometimes found today in larger collections, particularly in European markets.
