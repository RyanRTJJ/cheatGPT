 its jurisdiction extends throughout the State of Israel. 

The Supreme Court has both appellate and original jurisdiction. It is responsible for hearing appeals from lower courts and also has the authority to review the constitutionality of laws. The Supreme Court hears both civil and criminal cases as well as appeals from special military tribunals. The Court is ultimately responsible for interpreting the law and upholding the rule of law in the country. 

The Court consists of different departments, including Civil, Criminal, Administrative and Judicial Reviews. Each department is organized by panels of judges. The composition of the judges is determined by law; three senior judges sit on each court panel and decisions are based on majority rule, usually two out of three. 

The Supreme Court also provides advisory opinions. By law, the opinion of the Supreme Court is binding on all government agencies and on all courts. The Court also has the power to issue restraining orders and subpoenas, to issue orders to execute decisions, and to issue orders to confiscate property.

The Supreme Court is made up of fifteen permanent judges, each of whom is appointed for a fixed term by the President of Israel on the nomination of the Judicial Selection Committee. The Supreme Court may also appoint additional judges from the lower courts and from the public, as needed. 

The current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is Esther Hayut.
