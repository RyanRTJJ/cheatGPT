 all domains, including brain and brain circuits, emotional circuitry, and cellular metabolism, while also contributing to both neuronal and cell-wide processes.

However, the presence of neuro-motor pathways as these are key mechanisms must be stressed as they are not yet known in neuronal circuits. This raises the question with these considerations, namely: what is the physiological effect of multiple-unit molecular signals in this case, and what is the biochemical, psychological or pharmacological effect of two different levels of mTOR signalling and/or mTOR-related activation?

The answer is this: MUR-dependent induction of memory is not reversible, and if the degree to which mTOR is activated depends on both the degree of memory and the magnitude of the memory-related signal, then the process will either have a negative or positive phase, depending on the context and how the current information was originally received, or a positive phase with an effect. The process becomes more complicated as a result of the fact that mTOR and MUR may be present for a particular time interval and/or at a specific time. It probably therefore remains unclear to what extent, in this case, mTOR promotes a specific cognitive function in response to a particular stimulus of mTOR.

Since the development of neurotransmitters is a key research area focusing on the role of mTOR in memory-dependent induction from many different perspectives, this paper should provide some background to this field and provide an overview of how mTOR processes may take place, and provide
