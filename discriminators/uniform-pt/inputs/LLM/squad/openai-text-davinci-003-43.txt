. The American oil embargo of 1986 then put further pressure on the economy. Under Gaddafi, Libya's economy had become highly centralized and the government relied on oil income, refusing to allow the formation of private business. The simmering economic and political troubles officially ended with a new constitution in 1977. Though it changed the political system to an Islamic socialist state, the document did little to stimulate the economy - the country still heavily relied on oil. In the 1980s, the country lost its command economy as the government increasingly de-nationalized public resources and allowed foreign investment.

However, this period was also a time of increased military expenditures and military buildup, which hampered economic progress. In order to pay for its large military establishment, Libya borrowed heavily from abroad and the interest payments became increasingly burdensome. The 1986 American oil embargo drove the country into further economic problems. The drop in oil prices and increasing international pressure meant Libya was unable to pay its international debts and an austerity program was implemented. By 1988, the economy had considerably improved and oil exports began to rise. In the following years, Libya experienced a number of positive economic developments, including a booming tourism sector and increased foreign investment.
