 in the midlatitudes of the United States and Canada which were most likely wetter there. For comparison I calculated the climate indices of both cities.

The two maps are respectively based on the International Satellite and Ground Data set as of 2013. The global temperature average is 0.88 °C (29.5 °F), the city temperatures are 0.97 % above the climatic mean and 0.97 °C (30.5 °F), with average sea surface temperature of 1.38 °C (31.8 °F). The two maps shown here are combined according to the IOGACS method of correlation.

Summary

From an economical stand point, Boston has a significant economic advantage over many cities in the US due to climate. Most US cities suffer from climatic influence and Boston is not especially wet. However, a major cost is reduced tourism, of which Boston is less affected than other cities (this is due to increased access for the sea to the city).

If you would like to hear more about the economics of climate in Boston then I recommend the book Climate in Boston: The Economics and Empowerment of a City-State written by William S. Ruhl.
