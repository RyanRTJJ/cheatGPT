If you don't like a road you don't drive, the city of Calgary has the world's fastest possible standard for diesel emissions.

The "highway" makes up about 13 % of each square kilometre, so it's best not to drive at all if you're coming across an "idle street". Just remember, any "highway" driving in Calgary can get in some road blockages.

But in an open city, there's at least one street you can get around the block, but just as importantly one that's clean for a car â€“ there's the highway of choice:

It also works because car emissions really are a matter of
