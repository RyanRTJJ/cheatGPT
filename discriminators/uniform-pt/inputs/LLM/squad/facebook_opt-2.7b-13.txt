 distributions are indicative of a speciesâ€™ genetic and developmental history. Studies of the genes underlying the distribution of light-dark pelage coloration are still in progress. Color change in mammals correlates with the activity of some genes involved in the metabolism of amino acid substrates. However, the correlation between light and dark and the specific gene(s) involved are still unclear.

A mouse is a good model to explore the genetic and environmental effects associated with pelage (light and dark patches). We used a mouse strain that has long had the advantage of crossing freely into two other lines, one that has a phenotype for a light-dark pelage color and the other for darker pelage coloration. We also used a mouse strain that cannot produce a light-dark pelage phenotype by itself, but that can only produce a dark pelage when crossed with another phenotype. The second line, lacking the ability to produce a dark-pelage phenotype by itself, is known to have had mutations in genes important for energy metabolism involved in the synthesis and use of amino acids. We used various strategies to assess the genes involved in producing light versus dark pelage on these two mouse lines.

Our results indicate that genes involved in the conversion of amino acids to acetyl-CoA and lysine can be involved in the color distribution. However, the roles of these genes in the conversion of L-tryptophan (a substrate of some genes) to acetyl-CoA is still not clear. Furthermore, some of the genes involved in conversion of L-tryptophan and acetyl-CoA to pyruvate depend on gene function that is not yet known. The coloration pattern of the individual mouse strains has distinct expression patterns. The mice from the first line, lacking mutations in the
