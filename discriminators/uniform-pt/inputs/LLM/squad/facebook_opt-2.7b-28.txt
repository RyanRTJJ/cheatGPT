, Gjakova, Albania. Vashtë (or Vashtës) was a fertile, cultivated plain where maize (corn) was likely cultivated in its earliest form. In this article we explain the origin of agricultural society as well as agricultural techniques of early societies, from the Neolithic (4th millennium BC) to Bronze Age (1st millennium BC).

The origins of agricultural societies

The early Neolithic was the last period of archaic human evolution in Europe. After the Upper Paleolithic (4th millennium BC), early societies shifted from hunting and gathering and fishing to organized agricultural, hunting and gathering societies. We use the term “agricultural” here to refer to the way of using agricultural products in an agricultural society. This was preceded in Europe by several small settlements composed of numerous individuals sharing some agricultural tools and subsistence as hunter-gatherers. These “early agrarian communities” continued to use farming techniques with a few modifications, like planting of crops into raised terraces and cultivation of grasslands.

These communities evolved into “factory towns,” where large groups worked very intensively in small, decentralized manufacturing and agricultural enterprises. This was also the last phase after the final demise of these small and medium-sized communities in Neolithic Europe.

The Neolithic (or first millennium BC) was the first period of organized agricultural societies in Europe. By the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC, permanent, organized communities were found on an increasing number of sites throughout Europe. This was a society of permanent settlements and cities, often located at the coast, from which the hunter-foragers were migrating. The first agricultural societies spread out from the coasts to the central and eastern part of Europe. In some cases such settlements developed into large metropolises like Londina, Lüderitz, Mycenae, Sparta and Athens, and in others they became small regional metropolises or villages surrounded by a forest, such as in the Neolithic settlement of Wertumström, Thuringia.

In the 2nd millennium BC (c. 2100–1600 BC) there was a sharp geographical expansion to the
