 northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana. The Jurassic is divided into three epochs; the Early Jurassic, the Middle Jurassic, and the Late Jurassic.

In the Early Jurassic, the Earth's climate was temperate and humid, with numerous cyclic variations, and worldwide sea levels high. The Earth's fauna changed significantly, as many dinosaur lineages arose and diversified. During the Middle Jurassic, much of Pangaea had split into separate continents, and the Earth cooled again. Sea levels dropped and deserts widened. This period is known for its distinctive fossils, as dinosaurs reigned supreme. The Late Jurassic saw further cooling, with Gondwana slowly breaking apart and further species diversification. Some families of large dinosaurs, such as the short-necked sauropods, experienced their greatest evolutionary radiation during this time.

The Jurassic period is important in the history of our planet. There was a great deal of biodiversity during this time, and some important evolutionary developments occurred. Dinosaurs began to diversify at an amazing rate, and many new groups of plants and animals evolved. Additionally, Pangaea was breaking apart during this period, which had major impacts on the climate and continental distribution.
