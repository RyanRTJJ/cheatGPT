 first step towards German rapprochement with the Soviet Union. Litvinov had been the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs since 1930 and was viewed as an obstacle to the possible development of good relations between Germany and the USSR. In May 1939, he was removed from office and replaced with Vyacheslav Molotov, who was seen as being less ideologically hostile to Nazi Germany. Following this shift in Soviet foreign policy, then-German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop visited Moscow and ultimately signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in August of the same year. This agreement allowed Germany to launch their military offensive against Poland, which marked the start of World War II. 

The German rapprochement with the Soviet Union in 1939 was the result of wider shifts in the international order at the time. In April 1939, Britain and France officially proclaimed their willingness to support the Polish in the case of a German invasion, providing Hitler with an ultimatum. This placed Germany in a difficult position. As one historian has argued, this was the main reason why Hitler and the Nazi government decided to pursue a diplomatic agreement with the Soviet Union- in order to break the Anglo-French Alliance (the so-called "guaranteeing" of Poland). In the end, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact allowed Germany to launch its attack against Poland without fear of foreign intervention from Britain or France.
