 about the significance of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA, although some suggested that certain genetic markers such as the Akt family had a role in this. The researchers also found some associations between Akt related markers such as the Ashtin-Vabiri family (Avanti family. Aborigines from Australia, Canada, and South Africa), and Indian mitochondrial DNA (Vadravira Mijapova, et al., 2011). The researchers proposed that these mitochondrial markers have evolved during the human lineage through genetic differences between Ashkenazi and Siberian populations (Simmonds et al., 2011).

Researchers believe that Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA plays a key role in both the origin and origin of the human lineage. The Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA, found in various parts of the human genome, is extremely similar to that of DNA found in Siberian mitochondrial DNA. When it comes to human genetics, researchers believe Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA plays a crucial role in two important groups. First, Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA is a very homogeneous population that may share some similarities with DNA found in people from other species. Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA, combined with Siberian mitochondrial DNA, is the primary source of DNA found in the human genome. Second, Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA may not be fully homogeneous from modern humans.

This paper describes several recent studies, focusing on genes and individual variation that provide a basis for our understanding of mitochondrial ancestry. The current results clearly challenge the assumptions that many people assume of genetic ancestry and may be associated with certain genetic factors. One of the most interesting papers in the research group involved four individuals, Ashkenazi B. Richards
