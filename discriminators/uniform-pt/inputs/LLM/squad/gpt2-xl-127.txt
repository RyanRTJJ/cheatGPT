 syntax developed; medieval historians like Roger Bacon, Thomas Aquinas, and William of Ockham began to write.

At the university, universities developed. The university was the place where scholars had the greatest access to each other. It was not restricted to students but was open to all people. Unlike colleges and seminaries (the first of which did not exist in the 14th century), universities had more than just a curriculum. Many students studied law, law studies and theology. Many did much more. In fact, one of the best-preserved universities today is Cambridge (it is also famous for Shakespeare), which had, in the 14th century, more graduate students than the rest of the Middle East combined, but most took no undergraduate degrees. The Oxford modern school flourished during the Renaissance, with some of the best medieval scholars including Dante, Cicero and Ovid. During the Renaissance (and later), the students were always a part of the intellectual world.

At the university, students began to discover, and try to explain, the world outside (because the world outside was no longer hidden). The university did a good job of separating the world "known" from the "unknown" as well as teaching about it. The medieval universities, including Oxford, Cambridge, and Paris all had a distinguished library, a huge collection of manuscripts and maps (which helped to fill gaps in knowledge), and a fine collection of translations. Even so, this was an ideal university that did not produce any great scientists.

The medieval universities began to produce some. As universities became centers of learning, students from more diverse backgrounds tended to transfer there. The main reason for this was diversity of opinion. Not all scholars could agree about what was true, so they left these centers: at least, they did in the 1500s
