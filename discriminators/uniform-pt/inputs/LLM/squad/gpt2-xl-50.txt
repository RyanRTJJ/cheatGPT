 anxiety, and narcissism noted before, there is little evidence that teenagers are more narcissistic if they are egocentric. Although the tendency of adolescents to be self-conscious and insecure about their physical appearance may be a predisposing cause for the development of egoism, a negative association between self-consciousness, self-enhancement, and narcissism seems unlikely, for reasons elaborated in the next subsection.

2.2.2. Dichotic competition

Aspects of egoism which conflict with egoistic preferences for success in other people's lives are evident in the concept of dichotic competition. Individuals with positive forms of self-consciousness are likely to perceive their individual and social competence in terms of the others (see also DeShazo, 1980). Thus a person with positive self-consciousness would be more positively oriented towards the ability of others to contribute to his or her success or to other people's success. A person with low self-consciousness may feel that he or she is less competent because he or she does not compare their contributions in comparison with others. The self-effacing aspect of this kind of self-consciousness (e.g., the inability to feel superior to others) is an important aspect of self-contemplation, or self-awareness, which may also be a predisposing factor for narcissism. The self-effacing character of individual and social competence could thus promote a negative valence to narcissism, which is, again, not entirely implausible.

2.2.3. Egoistic and narcissistic traits in adults

The association between self-consciousness and narcissism in adolescents and adults is not as much evident for adults as it is for adolescents. In contrast to adolescent egocentrism, adult-directed aspects of narcissism are far more likely (or, in men, present far less frequently) to be evident in narcissism as associated with positive self-appraisal than in narcissism associated with self-effacing narcissism. This evidence does not seem to apply to the adolescent, since while adult-directed narcissism appears to be associated with less positive self-appraisals, narcissistic personality traits as such are generally less strongly associated than positive self-appraisals in adults.
