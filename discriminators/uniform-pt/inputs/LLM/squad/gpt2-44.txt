 have evolved a unique defense against pathogens and toxins.

Exposing to the ambient light can increase oxidative capacity for these organisms, which in turn increases an enzyme's capacity to catalyze a reaction to produce energy. Exposure to the light causes many pathogens to multiply before breaking down and spreading through the body, thus increasing the total number of organisms per animal in the body. When pathogens develop this kind of metabolism in animals they are also a common component of diseases like those that are fatal to humans. This means that the bacteria that feed on any prey that might eat it have a very low chance of transmitting their cancerous cells to humans, so there is no "need to go to the bathroom."

This lack of exposure to direct sunlight, however, can further exacerbate a disease's pathogenesis. Most of the time, these pathogens are very inefficient at their ability to kill animals, but also very efficient at breaking down tissues before entering the bloodstream or the blood. This may increase the ability of the bacteria in the body to carry certain bacteria, such as the Escherichia coli, to break down and colonize the blood.

As a result, when a certain type of bacteria is found in the body, it takes a very long time for the organism to develop an resistance to the specific pathogen or attack, as it could easily attack some other specific type of bacteria as well. Thus when it comes to infectious disease, the only good news is that many of the bacteria already present at
