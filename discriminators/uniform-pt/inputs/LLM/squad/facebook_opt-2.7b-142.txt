 education in the nineteenth century, Yale was in its first decade a liberal arts college with an emphasis on the humanities. To defend against the growing anti-intellectual movement then fermenting in the United States, Harvard’s Edward Albert published his famous 1827 essay, “The Nature, Character, and Value of the Education of the Young,” which argued that the education of the educated was the “foundation” of American civilization and that the humanities were “the great storehouse of the intelligence of men.”

The Yale Report, by contrast, argued that such subjects as Latin, Greek, and English were inadvisable for young Americans, arguing instead for an emphasis on mathematics, science, and liberal arts:

The study of the languages of antiquity has been so generally rejected as no longer inadvisable, perhaps even as worthless, as the study of the languages of modern times, that it is no wonder, at least to me, whenever I go into a lecture-room in a college, and see so many students with their faces buried in a Latin or Greek book, that I sometimes wonder how it is possible that they ever succeed in getting a practical knowledge of either. […]

[The humanities are] what I call the storehouse of human knowledge; the place where it is collected, the place where it has been preserved, the repository of all the things that are required for the man of modern times.
