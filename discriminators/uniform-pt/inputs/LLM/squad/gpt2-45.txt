After playing the role of Dr. Frankenstein in Disney's hit animated film The Jungle Book, Dr. Frankenstein (who had also appeared in the hit film D.I.Y.) reared his head a lot as a kid and began to get into trouble. In 1988, when the cast were about to embark on their first feature film, Dr. Frankenstein was named star of the animated movie The Jungle Book.

Although he took a different path in the lead roles of his two movies, after playing a scientist and his wife, the actor returned to the role that he started out as â€“ a surgeon named G.U.M.S.S.L. The character was played by a very different actor, David Fincher, until Fincher's real name came into the picture and he would be appearing as G.U.M.S.S.L. in the upcoming Disney Animated Universe!

Hugh Jackman and Ben Greengrass reprise their roles of Dr. Frankenstein and Dr. Frankenstein is seen in the movie.

After returning to the big screen stage, the second part that we see is of him playing the Doctor, he is still able to talk and act when he is not being heard at all.
