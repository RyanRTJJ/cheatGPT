 urine. But some, notably the emu and the flamingo, produce uric acid directly by a special enzyme. An enormous amount of nitrogenous waste enters the bloodstream in the course of normal digestion. An additional load of waste arises when tissues—from the stomach and throughout the body—produce new protein to replace that lost as dying cells are digested by enzymes produced by bacteria. Many of these proteins, called mucopolysaccharides (mucis), come packaged in the form of fibrous protein called glucosamine, which is also called collagen, an organic molecule composed of many amino acid chains (see figure in chapter 2). Some of these residues of dead cells, along with many nutrients, are excreted via the digestive tract as nitrogenous waste called nitrogenous molecules, a large part of the waste produced by the gut and the stomach. Nitrogenous molecules include ureic acid nitrogen, one of the building blocks of collagen. When we use an organ to make proteins or enzymes, it will also excrete a small amount of urea nitrogen, a nitrogenous waste by-product that will be absorbed as the urea nitrogen is used to produce more proteins and enzymes.

But what ails the bird's digestive tract? There must be a real, not a potential, nutrient issue, because the bird would produce the enzyme that creates the uric acid. What is actually going wrong with the bird's physiology? The answer was given by a team of researchers led by Professor Bruce
