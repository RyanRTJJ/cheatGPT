 the "V" shaped surface of the first missile (the 'V-2') was less stable than later versions. But some claim the missile was designed to carry a nuclear warhead and detonate immediately after launch.

This is a common explanation, but it is difficult to verify. Indeed, as the Russian Academy of Science in Moscow points out, there exists no documentation to support it. This does not stop the Russian Academy of Science, the leading authority on Soviet missile defence, from claiming that "the V-2 was so stable, it could be fired without a control system at all…" [13] And the Pentagon has no idea at all what "stable" mean.

The V-2, or rather Smerch, which was intended as a missile for launching nuclear missiles, was to deliver them by remote control. At about four years of war (1947?–9?), it was deployed at Kaliningrad (the Baltic Sea), but by the autumn of 1952 the Soviet Union had fallen apart politically and militarily. The Smerch program was then abandoned, only to be revived in 1957 to re-enlist and produce V-2s. They were to be deployed in the Far East by 1963.

By early 1959, General R. J. Smuts, then Soviet leader, had the task of determining how to deploy these weapons against the United States. He devised an alternative to the conventional ballistic missile in the spring of that year: missiles were being developed to carry nuclear warheads, so the Soviet air forces were concerned about having a weapon to carry one as well. The Smerch program was revived,
