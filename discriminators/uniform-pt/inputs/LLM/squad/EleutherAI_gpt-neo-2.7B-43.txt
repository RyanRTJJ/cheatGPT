 to the Iberian Peninsula at the time. This period lasted between 200,000 BC and 30,000 BC, and ended around 6000 BC. The name ‘Gallaeci’ was chosen because in Celtic traditions the land was inhabited by the goddess Galla, the Celtic goddess of the forest. There are many archaeological sites throughout this period, the most important being Oestrimbic, San Mateo de Día in the province of Vigo, and Los Alcornocales near Bilbao.

Oestrimbic

The first human settlements from which we can learn in detail about Galician prehistory were the settlements on the banks of the river Oestrimbic (or ‘Oestrig’ meaning ‘the opposite’ in Latin) which flows through the town (or ‘neighbourhood’) of Cegueritx.

The Oestrimbic River is the most important water source for cattle in the north of the Iberian Peninsula and is therefore a prime hunting zone. The Oestrimbic flows from east to west, in a south easterly direction and, in summer, there are heavy waterfalls in the river. From what we now know about the prehistoric settlement of Oestrimbic it appears that they lived by hunting, fishing and gathering food and firewood.

Early Bronze Age/Late Bronze Age settlement of Cegueritx

At the time when the modern-day Cegueritx town was inhabited the climate was warmer and the river Oestrimbic flooded occasionally during the rainy season. Later on, the climate became colder, and the water was dammed and controlled by man, first during the Iberian Iron Age, and later on also by the Celts, with the construction of dykes. The settlement we know as Oestrimbic was therefore the first settled city in the middle and upper valleys of the Oestrimic, and by implication also in other river valleys in the region. It is possible that the people of
