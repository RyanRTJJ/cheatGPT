 without hesitation.
It's an intelligent species though. They're not the typical prey animal. The one that's always come immediately to mind were the saber-toothed cats
True   I don't know the answer to this though.  Could be animals are simply afraid of him or her. Since these are mammals and mammals have a tendency to avoid their fears or run away from them, even though they are natural enemies.  Maybe to do with them being dangerous, like how humans won't stay in the same room with an angry dog for a reason.
Well, they're usually seen as the ones capable of intelligent thought, as in thinking about things/having abstract thoughts. At the very least, they're capable of showing advanced cognition and being willing to think long and hard about it.  So, if anything, they're smart enough to avoid being killed. Or at least think "I'm going to eat this guy" would make for one hell of a meal
I see, well in that case. They are capable but not intelligent, which is what the question was asking in the first place
My bad. In that case, all mammals are intelligent! They're smart enough to avoid the things that kill them, at least.
There's something to be said about animals, like in human societies, that will do anything to avoid being hurt. It's fascinating actually, the way dogs, cats, small children, teenagers, and others will act to mitigate a threat. I can't even really fathom how you would think of a way to do that in your situation without a conscious thought.
Haha, well I'm
