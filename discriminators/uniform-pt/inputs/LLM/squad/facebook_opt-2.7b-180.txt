 culture had very little in place to accommodate the large Tibetan population that would later grow to some 300,000 people. Tibetans were forced to adapt to Buddhist concepts rather than that of their Tibetan origin, such as the need to meditate constantly, or to pay homage (blessing) to the emperor before using the bathroom. In contrast, the Han people and other ethnic groups in mainland China were allowed to practice their own religion, such that Tibetan religion spread to other minority groups, such as the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.

Qing rule in Ladakh
Ladakh was originally under the control of the Chagai dynasty ruled from the Khyber Pass (then known as Qandahar), which was ruled by Tibetan Buddhists. After the Tibetans expelled the Chinese in 1594 (see Tibet Uprising, 1594â€“1600), and annexed parts of Pakistan in the following hundred years, China began attempting to reclaim parts of Ladakh. They claimed to own it as a territory to the north of Kashmir, despite never having sovereignty over it. The Tibetan Kingdom was established as the successor state to the erstwhile Chinese government and a stronghold for Tibetan independence.[1][2] This was followed by the Ladakh-based Chakma rebellion in 1727 that broke out after the Chinese failed to take Tibet.[3][4][5] The Chinese Army advanced into Ladakh, but the Tibetans held out.
