 Notre Dame while Protestants looked on and felt unwelcome. Protestants tried to suppress the Catholics. Although it was unlikely to become a national university, Notre Dame was the first Protestant university. It had an academic mission and made a living teaching. Its Catholic faculty supported and encouraged many American Catholics, many of whom found the University a refuge. It was a Catholic university that has since been reduced to a footnote in college history, although not in the academic discussion.

The most notable alumna of Notre Dame is John F. Kennedy Jr., the former Attorney General of the United States. Kennedy is one of the largest landowners in south Texas and is close to the great Catholic University at North Texas (UNT). As a member of the Senate, Kennedy voted against abortion, assisted suicide and civil rights, but he defended the rights of Americans who believed women had an equal responsibility to earn a living and earn their independence.

In 1941, before WWII, a Notre Dame team led by John F. Kennedy took out a number of undefeated teams and scored more points overall than anything Notre Dame ever played. By 1942, while fighting was still common in the war, Irish and Allied Marines, including Irish, became a strong professional team and captured more than half the victories for the U.S. Navy in the Pacific.
