 lawsuit against the University in state and federal courts in order to determine the constitutionality of two sections of the state’s HB-315, the “Lemon Law” or “Louisiana Motor Vehicle Lemon Law.” This law was passed by legislators under the guise of “tough” insurance legislation in order to make automobile insurance more expensive.

The lawsuit contended that two provisions of the law are unconstitutional and violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the Texas and United States Constitutions.

The case, Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin and Fisher v. State of Texas, was heard before the Texas 5th Court of Appeals. The case is currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, where oral argument was held on March 25, 2013. On June 25, 2013 the Justices ruled 8-1 in Fisher v. University of Texas to reject most provisions of the law and remanded the University’s decision to the state court.

The Lemon Law’s stated purpose is to provide consumers protection from fraudulent or defective motor vehicles and repair services. However, the law’s actual purpose is to prevent Louisiana auto dealers and their insurance companies from being subject to unfair competition and to shield automobile dealers from a “loophole” in the state’s lemon-law statute.

This particular law was passed without the consent or acquiescence of any other state that had enacted its own Lemon Law. Because of this, the law does not apply to New Jersey, New York, or any of the other 48 other states, as well as the District
