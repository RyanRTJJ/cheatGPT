.[1] The plunge in oil revenues was a key factor that caused the austerity measures and severe economic hardship which prompted the rebellion of Libyan army officers in the 1978 Gidda Uprising. As the economy deteriorated, the country looked to foreign investment to increase its oil production capacity.

In 1986, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi announced the "Great Man-Made River" (GMMR) project, a plan to transport water by pipeline from aquifers located in the south of the Sahara Desert to the population hubs in the northwest of the country. The project was partly funded by foreign investment, with Libya signing an agreement with the French company Totalfina in 1987 and the Italian company Eni in 1989.

The GMMR project consisted of four main phases involving the digging of 4,500 kilometres (2,800 miles) of tunnels and aqueducts, at a cost of $20 billion. The GMMR project provided water from the aquifers of the Nubian Basin in southern Libya to Libyan desert cities such as Tripoli, Benghazi and Sirte. This water was used for drinking, crop irrigation and for energy production.

The project is seen by supporters as Gaddafi's attempt to combat drought and improve economic growth in the country. However, some critics have claimed that the project was too ambitious and has had little impact on the economic development of Libya. In addition, some have argued that the project did not actually provide enough water to sustain the desert population. In spite of these issues, the GMMR project has consequently led Libya to become more self-sufficient in terms of water supply.
