 in the form of the copper-nickel cent, the zinc cent, the gold cent, the silver cent. The dollar coinage act created the gold piece and silver dollar to replace the gold-plated copper cent. The silver dollar replaces the silver cent, which was introduced two years earlier and later became obsolete.

Historically, the milled dollars were circulated from 1857 to 1889, with some exceptions. The last milled dollars in circulation were struck in 1907, prior to the coinage act, and in circulation from 1907-1909 as the "dollar cent". The milled dollar was then replaced in circulation by the penny and the nickel.

Today, the American numismatic community continues to appreciate milled dollars, and many examples of milled dollars enter the auction world. There are also numerous private milled dollar collectors. Milled dollars are often available for purchase at discount prices.

Design
Unlike most coins, where design or weight were dictated by the monetary denomination of the coin, milled dollars (also called "mint dollars") were created specifically for their "face value" (coin face value). Most milled dollars had a face value of $1 ($2, $5, etc.). Only the copper-nickel and zinc-cent faces were struck with their face values, these coins were valued at 1/5, 5, 10, 20, 40 or 60 cents; the gold coins (gold dollar, gold cent and silver dollar) were struck without any face value.

For example, gold coins that had face values of $1, $5, $10, $20 and $40, in value, were collectively referred to as "quarter dollars", while those with face values of $5, $10 and $20 were collectively referred to as "penny nickels". Similarly, silver dollars had the face values (1/19, 1/32 and 1/64) of $1, $2, $5, $10 and $20. So a silver dime was valued at 1/20, 1/32 and 1/64; a 1/8-ounce silver dollar was valued at 1/8, 25 cent and 25 cent.

One feature of each milled dollar was its "reverse". All
