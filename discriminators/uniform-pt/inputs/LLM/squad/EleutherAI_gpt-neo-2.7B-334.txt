 Hampshire and New Mexico), was a near-tie. But who really lost and why?

One explanation was that Republicans lost because of a negative campaign. That seems like extreme understatement to many pundits: In the race for the Republican nomination, both Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich have been so negative that Romney was unable to convince anyone who supported him otherwise that he is a genuine conservative or that he understood the issues on which he was running.

The other, perhaps lesser, explanation is that because Mitt Romney was seen as the winner in the Ohio race, he won Ohio. This was partly true: Ohio has long been Romney country, and a victory here did put Romney a lot of money in his bank account. But his winning didnâ€™t guarantee Ohio: It made Ohio a swing state, and its Republican establishment was not happy about it.

So, after four days, there is still not a solid consensus on who was cheated and why. The Ohio election is not over, but the state is still too close for it to have been a result of widespread voter fraud. The Republican campaign had almost no spending in that state. If that was responsible for the apparent split vote between Romney and Gingrich, some might say it was only responsible for the split margin to Gingrich.

In the last week, three states have decided that they are not Republican but not Democrat, and it was apparent that Ohio, Kansas (which had been a bellwether),
