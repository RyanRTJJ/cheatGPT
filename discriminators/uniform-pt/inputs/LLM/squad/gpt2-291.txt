 literature of early literary criticism, which, in addition to producing more literary manuscripts, resulted in a great number of new volumes. On the other hand, as modern writers began to incorporate the Old Latin and have increasingly taken the modern English into their lives, they faced formidable difficulties translating what has made them distinctive and which contributed to their decline. The New Translation by D.H. Thomson, published in 1792, was one of the great successes of the New Translation, which continued and developed the Old Latin with its own new translation. It was also the first new translation which, though a popular work, produced much of the vocabulary and features from which the English language derives. This work was edited largely by two other authors, the first by Richard Wood, first editor of a translation of the Latin in 1633 and then editor of another of this particular work; Charles Darwin, who was the first modern author to consider the importance of the Old Greek, and his own father, a Latin American physician and philosopher, produced a series of works of that type, in which he treated the Greek alphabet and his new translation.

This result in a system of literary translation was particularly positive because it provided the basis for both the historical and the literary texts.
