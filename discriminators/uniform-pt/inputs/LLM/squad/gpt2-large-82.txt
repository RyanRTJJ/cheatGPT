 The predatory instinct is innate in humans and wolves, even in our ancestors. The wolf is a vicious animal and a truly magnificent hunting and catching animal. The wolf is a killer. It is not just the most successful killer animal in the history of the world (though it has been an extremely skilled hunter and fisherman for tens of millions of years). But at its core, the wolf is a predator. It is the smartest predator in nature and its instincts are the most potent and dangerous.

Of course, the wolf is also the most powerful animal on the planet. On land and in water, the wolf can move at a pace a cat or a polar bear can only dream about. The swiftness, agility and sheer strength give it a frightening level of power and can easily destroy its prey. Just one of the incredible feats of an alpha predator is found in the case of a man who used his mind to predict his opponent's movements so he could predict the exact moment he'd have to strike. This incredible speed is not merely a trait of the alpha predator. As an average human, you can run over a man's head. An alpha predator is able to outrun all the great speedsters on this planet for a whole day, even with one leg.

So why do we kill the wolf? The answer to both of those questions is clear. It's a natural, even healthy, predator. Its instincts are very powerful and it is constantly looking for mates, food and other prey.
