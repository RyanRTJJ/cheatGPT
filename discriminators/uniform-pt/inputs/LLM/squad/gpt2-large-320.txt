 past year, and 36% have had at least one sexual relationship during the same year [4, 5].

A longitudinal study involving 725 adolescents reported that the higher the adolescent sexual activity in the preceding year, the more likely they were to have begun a romantic relationship in their second year of life [6]. In addition, romantic relationships tend to be longer lasting than non-romantic relationships, suggesting that the development of a romantic relationship during adolescence can facilitate the initiation and continuation of longer-lasting romantic relationships throughout the rest of the lifetime [6]. However, a recent meta-analysis reported that there was no association between past-year sexual activity and the likelihood of a romantic relationship lasting one year or more. Further supporting this finding was a study from the UK, which found that high rates of sexual activity were found in the prior five years, but the rates were not associated between the sexual history and relationship outcomes, suggesting that not all sexual experiences have a positive impact on romantic relationship outcomes, although there were strong associations between past-year sexual activity and the likelihood of a lifetime committed relationship lasting one year or more [7].

In recent years, interest in early adulthood onset of romantic relationships has increased. In 2014, the European Institute of Public Health was asked to provide a brief brief about the development of romantic relationships during adolescence and early adulthood by the general population [8]. The short report concluded that while sexual activity is important, more studies were
