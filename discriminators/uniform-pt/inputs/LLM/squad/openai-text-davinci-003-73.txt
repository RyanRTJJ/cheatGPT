 the concept of race has been socially constructed across different cultures and is a recent development in human history. They argue that the genetic variation seen among different human populations is primarily the result of adaptation to their physical environment over the last 70,000 years.

The concept of race has been used in the past to permeate culture and power structures, leading to institutionalized racism both within and between different populations. They claim that race is a social construct, which has emerged from specific historical contexts and stands as an abstract concept that is detached from actual biology. Even the notion that a person belongs to one particular race is argued to be the result of socially constructed views of racial characteristics.

Proponents of this perspective claim that race is used as a form of social group identification, rather than as a measure of biological diversity. Consequently, different populations can both be seen as members of different “races”, depending upon its social and historical context. It is argued that race is a fluid and socially constructed concept, as opposed to being an inherent and fixed property of individuals.
