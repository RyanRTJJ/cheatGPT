 systems and thus there is an interaction between mood and stress, just as there is between hormones and the stress systems. This may include an interaction between some of the main components of emotion, and they are also related with the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, which regulates stress and thus could affect its outcome.

Hormones and the stress system

The sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system, which is related to slowing down the stress response, control the central stress response system. This system involves the release of hormones.

The most well-known examples are the "fight or flight" hormones of testosterone and adrenalin, which are controlled centrally and the release of cortisol.

The most well-known example of the release of these stress hormones through stress is from physical stressors. Physical stressors (such as driving on a crowded road) are usually accompanied by changes in mood and arousal, which can affect the central control of the stress response system.

When stressed, the central control system is also affected by the production of the enzyme called catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). There are other ways in which the COMT enzyme affects the stress response, such as influencing the release of other stress hormones such as testosterone and norepinephrine. The COMT enzyme regulates the synthesis and release of these hormones, so its impairment or suppression can lead to a number of conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and the cardiovascular disorders as well as certain psychiatric disorders.

Other stress associated conditions include:

Inhalation of tobacco smoke

Exposure to anesthetics through surgery or surgery complications

Alcohol-induced liver damage, or liver carcinoma

Stress-induced alterations in the mood and the cardiovascular system
