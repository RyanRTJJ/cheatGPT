 for example, is home to the same kinds of plant species as North America, but a similar number of species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish.

A good summary of Darwin's ideas at work can be found in The Descent of Man (1871), wherein Darwin begins with a clear example of environmental selection in an organism:

"The naturalist thus discovers in the individual, which we call man, not all the organs of life by nature to which he is capable, but those of those with which he has adapted himself to the conditions and environment of the habitat."

But is Darwin correct in noting that this particular habitat does not exist at all in North America? The presence of mammals does seem to have been established by European explorers to the Americas during the 18th and 19th centuries, and although the term "species" was not used extensively until the 19th century, they were already well-understood to be species, and they were in fact very much living in a region now known as North America.

To complicate matters, Darwin has always known there are mammals in Australia: "It was not the common negro which was to prove his ancestry or his progenitor's lineage in the interior of Europe; but the grey bush-cat, which is a species nearly common between the North and South-America."
