 support from the Plan of Ayutla. Through the Plan, Santa Anna was removed from power, land was redistributed to the people, and many of the most liberal reforms were saved. The new constitution which was formed later in 1855 also included guarantees for civil liberties, freedom of the press, and slavery was abolished.  Furthermore, it declared Mexico a presidential republic, and established the Supreme Court of Justice. 

In addition to the ratification of the new constitution, the Plan of Ayutla allowed for a more decentralized Federal System of government, where each Mexican state had more autonomy. This decentralized system granted each state a greater role in governing themselves, giving the states a greater ability to determine their own economic policies, without the interference of Mexico City. 

The Plan of Ayutla was a unified effort aimed at promoting repeal and unity in the face of great chaos. It helped heal the wounds of war brought on by years of civil unrest and the rise of dictators like Santa Anna. By passing the Plan of Ayutla, Mexico was able to move towards a more modern and open society, and with it, finally brought orderly rule and peace back to the country.
