 was threatening the US (and its friends there), that his regime had been responsible for torture and had killed US soldiers, and that it had been responsible for the deaths of US citizens, for which all of us should be held responsible.

These reasons are, of course, entirely fallacious, and have no bearing whatsoever on the fact that Saddam's brutal regime is responsible for any number of crimes against his own people. Indeed, it is unlikely that any of these crimes, including torture, are the type perpetrated by the kind of regime we're supporting in Iraq.

But that's not how the case was presented in many of the media outlets I consume. For example, in a piece entitled "Iraq: No More Deaths by Torture" by journalist Chris Hedges that appeared in The Guardian on August 11, 2006, Hedges claimed that the UN had certified Saddam's regime as having "the most efficient state-to-state control in the world". Hedges added that Saddam's torturers, who would be "at the top of the list of those being hunted by the US military and CIA", "would never admit that they have tortured or killed anyone because they have to justify their actions to the highest ranks in their countryâ€¦ they would be murdered just as surely in their next interrogation by their enemies as they were a few minutes after they committed their crimes."

If Hedges was right, that's one-thing: the US and UK should go after Saddam's torturers. Or at least make it clear that the victims were torturers.

But they weren't, and Hedges wasn't. Rather than condemning torture, Hedges said America should "help Iraq secure a legal protection under the Geneva convention," since Iraq had not met the requirements of Article 33, which requires "the law or judicial system" to be able to punish crimes by torture or similar procedures -- that is, an independent judiciary. Hedges also rejected the US's reliance on claims that torture is "the supreme evil": "You can read the Geneva accord and conclude after reading it what I think in my heart of hearts.
