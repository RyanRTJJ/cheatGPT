 but instead came primarily thanks to the Chinese government and Chinese companies. In the aftermath of the Chinese campaign, many Tibetans returned to China despite their Chinese government support of repression of the Dalai Lama regime, and later Tibetans who were still loyal to the Dalai Lama fled back to China seeking asylum in China. With less than 12,000 people left in exile and with China effectively re-establishing the status quo on Tibet, it is unlikely that the current diplomatic crisis will lead to a re-emergence of contact with Qing China.

The Ming courts, with their heavy reliance on the Chinese army, was the only place for Tibetans to get official and "Chinese" recognition throughout the Ming period. As long as the Qing dynasty survived, the only legitimate reason to contact Tibet was for support — in the Chinese tradition, to seek support. Even as Chinese officials sought to eliminate Tibet's culture, language, and religion, their government offered the Chinese government support on Tibet — a support that continued in Chinese policy throughout the Qing period, even though Tibet's government never explicitly accepted Chinese support and had no means of establishing a political identity outside of exile.
