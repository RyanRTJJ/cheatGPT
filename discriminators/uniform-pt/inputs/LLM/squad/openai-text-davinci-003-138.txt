The belief in Mary's Immaculate Conception can be traced back to the 5th century in the Eastern Church. It was particularly expounded upon by Sergius, Patriarch of Constantinople (610-638) and by Germanus I, Patriarch of Constantinople (715-730). These two influential Eastern Fathers taught that Mary was preserved from all stain of sin from the moment of her conception and enjoyed a special indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Such views, although not fully developed or unified, formed the basis of the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception as later propounded by Latin theologians.

In the 11th century, the teaching gained significant traction among Eastern theologians such as Michael Psellos, Symeon Metaphrastes and Nicetas of Paphlagonia. At the same time, Western theologians such as Anselm of Canterbury and Peter Lombard began to take notice of the idea, along with some of the leading Western representatives of the Order of Saint Benedict, such as William of Saint Thierry, Peter the Venerable and Bernard of Clairvaux.

The teaching was formally enshrined by Pope Pius IX in 1854, making it an official dogma of the Roman Catholic Church. Since then, it has become an important article of faith for many Roman Catholics around the world.
