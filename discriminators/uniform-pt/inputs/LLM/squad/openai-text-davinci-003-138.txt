 response, the United States opened negotiations for the International Geophysical Year, which sought to advance science and technology across the world. The International Geophysical Year laid the foundation for an even grander project: an international agreement for space exploration, known as the Outer Space Treaty of 1967. This treaty regulated the exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, and banned the placement of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on the Moon or other celestial bodies. The Outer Space Treaty also laid down the principle that all countries have equal access to space and its resources.

At the time, the Soviet Union was the leader in space exploration, with both Yuri Gagarin and the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, being launched into space by the country. Since then, the space race between the two superpowers began to come to an end in 1982 with the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. By this time, Reagan had ended the manned space shuttle program in the U.S. Soon after, the Cold War had come to an end and the two countries began to cooperate on space matters. Today, both countries are partners in the International Space Station and various other ventures in space.
