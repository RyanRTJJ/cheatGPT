 Ommatopoea, Cretaceous Cretaceous and Permian Periods. The Ommatopoea has been the subject of intense research, particularly by David R. Hart (1988) [1] and the fossil record. This research has been supported by the NCBI, UK government and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and has also featured as a lecture at Harvard University. The Cretaceous is of interest to our understanding of the evolution of the supercontinent, both because of its large volumes of evidence and for its potential role in the extinction of Ommatopoeaea [2]. However, there are two major exceptions, the Acheulinaean and Australopithecus (A.A.K.A. Australopithecus, which has been extensively investigated by Dr David R. Hart who co-authored the paper on which this paper is based). These two fossils contain two very different patterns. A large number of these specimens are composed predominantly of soft bone, whilst the oldest from this group contain bone (anodolite) of a very different composition [2]. Both of these individuals were members of the Acheulinesa, a group which is regarded as evidence for the earliest hominid evolution based on morphological characteristics (such as having a slightly shorter skull, and a shorter face and body length) [2]. However, a paper by Hart [1] suggests that only the Pangoleitae (and some of the Ardeoidea) of eastern Australia may be truly Australopithecine in origin.

Pangoleitae (Ardeoidea) The first Pangoleitae fossils from western Australia, belonging to the Neogene, were
