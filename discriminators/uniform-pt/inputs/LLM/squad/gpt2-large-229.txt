 one case, a white family was able to acquire a slave on a black farm and sell him as a house servant to get out of the poverty. In other cases, white slaves were able to purchase a black family and eventually convert them to Christianity. Although these practices were not as widespread as in other countries, they still did exist. In the mid-nineteenth century, American slavery, at least in southern U.S. states, came to resemble and to some extent share the conditions of the old slaves' labor.

In late slavery and the American Civil War, the black population declined for one reason as it came to dominate the nation: new transportation modes for American black communities were brought into use, and more black people in America became able to move from one neighborhood or community to another. With that transformation came the need for new places to live. And cities are a valuable space for blacks because of their location between an urban core and a residential area.
