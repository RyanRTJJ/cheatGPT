 meaning and function. In many modern European countries, the universities are nowadays viewed as more "pure" research institutions, while the polytechnics and the institutes of technology used to be the ones offering more practical and technical education (see, for example, the article by Robert L. S. Jones in the volume edited by Michael Eulers, J. P. E. Smith and Walter S. J. Cribb, L&S Press, Oxford, p. 101 (1982)). More specifically, polytechnics are generally considered nowadays as a means to train engineers only.

In this sense the polytechnic in France is not the same as the polytechnic in Canada, since the former seems to remain mainly for training industrial workers for specialized professions (automotive, electrical and hydraulic), and the latter, instead, seems to be much more involved in technical education.

Similarly, in the United States, generally associated with the concept of "engineering education", the polytechnic in the United States is more associated with a "trade school", and this school focuses on general education (with, however, emphasis on technical education like in Germany) for people from different backgrounds, and it has a more or less well-defined aim of preparing people for a technical profession (see the article by John H. Brown in the volume edited by Raymond F. L. Miller, D. A. Weems and Paul C. Deutschen, John S. Lippincott Co., Inc., Philadelphia, p. 5 (1978)).

As early as 1909, the word polytechnic first appeared in French, in the term Polytechnique École Pratique (practical technology school) [1]. It was adopted more recently, in 1945,[2] as the name of an institution of higher learning in France, which later on became replaced with the term "École Polytechnique", which was introduced in 1971 [3]. For over 100 years, the name "polytechnic" has not been used in Canada. In some English-speaking countries the term polytechnic is used to describe the institutions of higher education that offer an all-round, technical education (see the English Wikipedia article on polytechnic in relation to the USA).
