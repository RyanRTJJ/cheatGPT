Marionettes for Sale

One of the early songs that made the rounds on the internet was produced for a film in 2005 called Marionettes for Sale. It was part of a number of films produced by the London based production company M. D. V. Productions for the film series "Top of the Pops" (the same people that produce "Late Night with Conan O'Brien", "The Tonight Show", "Jimmy Fallon "and "TNT"). It features Madonna singing a different rendition of her hit song, "Like a Virgin".

Madonna herself sang the song over a live band, and in the opening scenes of the movie she is actually singing it for the actors.

When she was not promoting her music, Madonna's appearance on the popular reality TV show "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" in 2007 gave people a chance to see exactly what the average female celebrity looks like. Madonna, along with friends Kendall Jenner, Kris Jenner and Kris's daughter Kylie Jenner, played the part of regular and average reality TV stars in the reality show. The show premiered in July 2007, and it ended in March of this year. The reality TV show featured celebrities, such as Kanye West, Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and others, in real life
