 into statements about objects-in-themselves. The only way to express a statement about the world is to introduce an additional term into the language-not as a new proposition to be asserted, but simply as an auxiliary in the system of statements that are in play in that world. Humean statements are not themselves truth-bearers; but the auxiliary, together with the relevant world, generates the truth-value to be attributed to such a statement.

By that time the language of physics had been transformed by a major theoretical advance. This made explicit the tacit notion that the world is composed of many parts and not just of one big thing. It showed how the world in general is a system of entities, including both particles and fields, and how its parts are in general different from those parts of other possible worlds. This made it possible to introduce concepts of a new type from which all other concepts had been excluded and to formulate laws that allowed us to understand the whole system of parts and their interconnections.

The fact that the auxiliary is not a single proposition to be expressed but simply a device introduced into the language of mechanics, chemistry or astronomy, and that it may have quite different contents for possible worlds differing very slightly, indicates that physics was no longer concerned with any sort of reality that is absolutely inaccessible to the understanding. Rather, the laws discovered by theory (or accepted in agreement
