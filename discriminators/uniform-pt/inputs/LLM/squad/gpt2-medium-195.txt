 addition to being essential or good for us, they are potentially hazardous to our body.

So-called micronutrients (such as omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, vitamin K and calcium) can have important health benefits during pregnancy and breastfeeding. So much so, in fact, that there's evidence that consuming one of these might even be beneficial for you (see graphic below).

FDA-approved micronutrient labels indicate one serving of an essential fatty acid-rich vegetable such as lettuce, cabbage, carrots or broccoli should be taken of three times (5 servings) of the following foods each week:

Lean meat

White beans, lentils, peas, rice or corn

Served with a little extra (6 servings each) from a non-essential component such as nutsâ€”one half serving is considered the limit recommended by one of the leading global food safety organizations, the World Health Organization (WHO).

Lack of micronutrient intake, therefore, is an increasing health and safety concern for both the mother and the baby. As the baby breastfeed, it's the mother who needs to know how much her baby's daily nutrient needs are at their highest, not the baby's doctor or nutritionist.

The United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that women and men should have between six hours of adequate sleep a night (2 to 4 hours of a full, natural sleep).

Some studies suggest that women who are poor in adequate sleep, such as women who drink alcohol, are twice as likely to
