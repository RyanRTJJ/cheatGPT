The character design of the Silver Samurai is based on Sam Lee, a character from Spider-Man, and was used as Silver Samurai in Marvel's Avengers storybook. The comics version of Sam Lee is a very different character.

The first Silver Samurai appears in Marvel Comics #7 and #9. A copy of the character who is introduced in the comics origin story was used as the basis for the Silver Samurai in Marvel Comics #9. A copy of Sam Lee was used with one of his own arms removed and reattached to a body made of metal. This second Sam is described as having a "silver body" and a "golden arm". The second-generation Silver Samurai, as a hero, is described as "a man on the run," and has a special ability to "shield his body from any harm" which allows him to walk like a ghost. In "Uncanny X-Men #108," he is seen fighting Magneto's Brotherhood.

A third Silver Samurai was created by writer Gerry Kelly, and published as an annual in the 1990s. He is an ally of the Silver Samurai, who he states "would rather see the world burn" than be used against him. The third Silver Samurai is later portrayed as the leader of the First Order, a villain from the Star Wars universe.
