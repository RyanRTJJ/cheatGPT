 modern life, fats are more often consumed in the form of commercial oils, which are high in fats with an oxidized state (so-called solid fats). Even though these oils are high in energy and fats with relatively low omega-3 fatty acids, they contribute to the oxidation of other essential fats. (See the "Essential Fatty Acids" section of the chapter.)

Other than the high percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids in the Western diet and even though many studies have shown that polyunsaturated fatty acids are more effective than saturated fatty acids at lowering blood cholesterol, research has not shown a clear benefit of these polyunsaturated fatty acids when used alone in the diet. One reason may be that several monounsaturated fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are metabolized by enzymes found in the liver to produce other metabolites.

Saturated fatty acids are most commonly found in vegetable oils and some fats found in dairy products. Other types of fats exist naturally that may have a more favorable effect on blood cholesterol and other cardiovascular risk factors. These include polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish and fish oil and omega-6 fatty acids from plants, such as flaxseeds and walnuts.

A good place to start learning about nutrition is the Food Guide Pyramid, also available in print as a handy booklet that you can distribute to your family at your next family meeting. This is the most thorough
