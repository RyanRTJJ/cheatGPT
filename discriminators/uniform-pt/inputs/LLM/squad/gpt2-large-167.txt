 and access to space for military, scientific, and commercial purposes. The first stage of competition included launches and experiments of four launch vehicles, two of them Soviet. The final stage of competition was the construction of a space station that was required to meet the Treaty on the Rights of Man, to be located in space; however, due to the failure of the first two space stations, the third stage was not constructed or begun on time.

The Soviets developed a new space launch vehicle, the Proton ICBM, based on the USSR's Molniya rocket. The Proton ICBM consisted of a solid fueled upper stage, powered by two engines, with a first stage of three engines. The first stage was fitted with a solid rocket motor which propelled the rocket through vacuum; second stage contained a liquid fuel main engine. The Molniya rocket gave the USSR the first opportunity to gain an access to space, however, the first five successful launches failed at least once.

In addition to space, the US also became involved in the space competition at this time. The US built an ICBM based on the SR-71 Blackbird aircraft flown by the Air Force. The US Air Force deployed the Blackbird and its SR-71 aircraft onto five missions and later modified its SR-71 aircraft with additional armaments. During the first flight of its Blackbird ICBM, on Novo Kuzna 16,
