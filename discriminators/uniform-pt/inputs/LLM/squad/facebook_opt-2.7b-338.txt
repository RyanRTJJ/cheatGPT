 where this extraordinary innovation took place, and in doing so have demonstrated that the scientific revolution started many years before then.

The first modern science textbook, a book called Physica Generalis, written by Cornelius Agrippa and published in 1541, offers a complete scientific view of nature. While it does not contain the word'science', it is the first step toward the modern scientific revolution. Not until 1799, after the publication of Samuel Descriptio Unito, will any book about science have the word'science' (or the Latin for science, scientia).

The most famous of all modern science texts is the Principia Mathematica, written in two parts. Each part offers a complete scientific view of mathematics. It was published in 1587 by Sebastian Borel, a mathematician born and educated in Strasbourg.

The first book of modern science did not emerge until the end of the seventeenth century, some 250 years after the first book of modern mathematics.

In the middle of the same century Thomas Young in London published A New Method of Computing Quantitative Inferences. It is a textbook intended as a tool for working with scientific data, not for scientific research in general. It contains a list of about 120 propositions, including the following two propositions:

'In the four elements of nature which are air, fire, water, and earth, all objects have no motion by themselves'

'The whole sphere is constituted by one motion in each thing, namely, the rotation of
