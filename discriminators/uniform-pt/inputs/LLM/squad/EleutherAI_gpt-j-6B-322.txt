 out the Cubs 5-0 on Sunday in Chicago.

Chicago will be facing the World Series champion Boston Red Sox as they begin the American League Championship Series. The Sox will be looking to avenge their epic loss that was overturned a month ago due to the new rules that were implemented in both leagues.

In the NLCS the Cubs took a 1-0 lead in a 4th inning double by Anthony Rizzo but had a shaky 8th inning when the Marlins loaded the bases, only to have Kris Bryant throw out Will Venable at first.

Here’s a look at how this game played out:

Marlins:

Marlins hitters went 4 for 8 with the two home runs: Giancarlo Stanton, Christian Yelich, and Miguel Rojas

Manny Machado threw out Dexter Fowler easily to end the top of the 1st inning

Marlins starter, Jose Urena, pitched through one bad inning, but gave way to Logan Morrison to lead the team. Urena allowed the Chicago first two runs in the 2nd inning.

Chris Corrente was a very sharp relief for J.T. Realmuto and he was used for 9 innings for a perfect 2 innings.

Here’s a look at the action from the top of the 9th inning of the NL Wild Card Game as the Miami Marlins were trailing 6-4 against the Atlanta Braves and the game was knotted at six on an impressive 8th inning by Max Fried on 3 2/3 innings
