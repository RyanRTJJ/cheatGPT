atia in medical education; Thomas R. Ford, a founding dean of physicians; Samuel L. Fung, who, along with fellow Northwestern neuroscientist Richard Feynman, pioneered the field of artificial intelligence; and Edward H. Hahn, a pioneer of research on blood plasma, blood loss and the immune system in diseases of aging and cancer. Their combined achievements are the subject of a forthcoming book from The Wachovia Publishing Company in Boston and the subject of a new exhibition at the National Museum of Natural History on Saturday.

But beyond those three famous figures, there has been a steady line of researchers who have created breakthrough pharmaceuticals, including Stanford physician Paul Ehrlich and Nobel laureate Peter Dweck -- the late Howard Hughes, who made his name fighting anti-semitism in Los Angeles. Then there was neuropharmacologist and former president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Paul Ehrlich, Jr., and his longtime partner, psychiatrist Charles Frees, who created several drugs that were shown to reduce cancer risks in humans. And then there had the pioneering work of the neuroscientist Irving Fisher. They introduced stem cells to treat certain types of spinal cord tumours -- and then, with Fisher and a few other breakthrough researchers at nearby Stanford University, had them used to treat several disease groups in mice, proving the "invertebrate model of disease."

There aren't many people on the entire planet with a doctorate, but one person who fits that definition has been working on research and developing new treatments for cancer for more than eight years. Dr. Joseph S. Fisch, who served as editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, was born August 19, 1923, in Brooklyn to Jewish parents named Josephine and Benjamin Fisch. Today he is a senior fellow in the division of basic medicine and director of
