She has a very gentle, gracious, kind, unpretentious quality and is very sweet but is somewhat naive. As a teacher, she loves children and the countryside. That's why she started looking for a house in the country."

After his retirement from Hollywood, Schwarzenegger continued to have a good relationship with his friends and colleagues. He often attended events that they made or participated in, such as the annual World War II Victory celebration. Schwarzenegger was also known as a big partaker in drinking club and night clubs in San Diego. He was invited to a night club by former President William Howard Taft in 1952 under the auspices of the Taft-Ostler Foundation. Schwarzenegger did not return the invitation by the time of the event in New York. Later, Schwarzenegger received invitations to the World War II Victory celebration held at the Hyatt Regency in Malibu, California.

After the success of his first autobiography, "One Night With Arnold," he began work on his second, "The Body." The book sold more than four million copies and was nominated for numerous awards.

Following the successful completion of the two books, Schwarzenegger signed on for a third book, "Sling Shot," which was released after his third movie, "The Terminator." However, in 1989 a fire destroyed the production process and the entire production project was scrapped. He was replaced by Michael Biehn. After leaving "The Terminator" he also began a series of series television shows.

Schwarzenegger was also featured in several feature films, including the film "True Lies." Several of his roles in films have also been turned into television series. His most recently featured role was as a character in the film "The Expendables 3".
