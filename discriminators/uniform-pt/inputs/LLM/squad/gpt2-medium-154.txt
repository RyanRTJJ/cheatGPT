 using a series of steps that are unique to our dataset" (5). The study described all participants and showed that there was significant maternal separation and genetic diversity between the two groups. The study described the most significant maternal group as a single major monophyletic haplogroup at 613 kb downstream of the Rha/Rha1A substitution at the X-chromosome level. The first five kb of the C/C-repeat-containing (CN-Rha/Rha1A) segment was identified as a second major haplogroup at an additional four kb upstream, at the X-chromosome level (Figure 1a,b).

Figure 1 Identification of distinct independent haplogroups located upstream of two major monophyletic monophyletic haplogroups at 613 kb of downstream X-chromosome. (a) The five major monophyletic haplogroup subclades are identified at the 613-bp level in the phylogenetic tree, with five sub clades located downstream of specific haplogroups (6). The five haplogroup subclades were identified by tree construction using multiple-marker analyses with multiple alignments into the 613-bp tree and with a maximum likelihood method (12). The major components at 613-bp are illustrated along with their major morphological features along with corresponding molecular positions of the topology-based components (13). To avoid spurious data from independent studies in regions with differing geographic positions of major subclades where additional testing is needed, the five subclades were assigned with the same numerical value as the haplogroup subclades found downstream of each subclade. Clades 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of the Rha2B-T allele (Y-STR haplogroup) have also been mapped to major mitochondrial and nuclear haplogroup subsets.
