 their ecological requirements. It is during the last hundred million years and the early Paleocene that mammals have flourished.

The earliest examples of the group are the earliest of dinosaurs, which began living about 220 million years ago. Their large heads were probably their first adaptations for hunting, as the size of their skulls made them very visible and conspicuous when hunting. Their diet was made up almost entirely of tough tough, tough and tough-looking animal matter, with a fairly good quality of life. Early mammals such as mammoths, elephants, and horses have been named by comparing their skeletons with those of larger living mammals. Large animals have long necks and short, thick skulls whereas small animals have long necks and long, slender skulls. However, since the early Triassic age and the origin of terrestrial mammals, mammals have evolved long necks with short, slender skulls.

Mammals include the famous large, powerful giraffes such as those pictured here, and the smaller smaller, much larger ground sloths. However, most mammals are not as big as some extinct species of mammoth or mastodon. Mammals have all made adaptations to allow them to endure a broad range of climatic conditions, including arid semi-arid land environments, warm oceanic environments, and arctic arctic environments. Many mammals have adapted to a diet of fruits and nuts. In the UK, many types of mammals live in woodlands, grassland, plains, mountain terrain and wetlands, such as marshes and wetlands. The range of habitats is very extensive in the UK. In the north it is dominated by
