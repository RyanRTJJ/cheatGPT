 This view in fact has been defended by several authors, particularly John Rawls. He writes:

The basic task of ethics is to give to every human being a sense of his obligations to himself, to others, to the world, and thus to other beings. It is not merely to provide a means whereby we can, through our actions and choices, be disposed toward actions in which we may have good purposes, such as promoting an end that we have a duty to promote. The goal of ethical reasoning, and to a great extent the aim of all human intellectual practice, is to produce a sense of one's duty to oneself, to others, to the world, and thus to other beings, while remaining in contact with these other beings within a coherent and adequate way. So far as we can trace this aim backwards to the origins of reason, that is in the earliest beginnings of history, then ethics, in Kantian terms, stands for a sort of unbroken harmony of action and thought. (Rawls 2005, 54)

He may be right, but his analysis – in particular his position – stands on the threshold of absurdity. In principle Kant could have argued that ethics can be "grounded" in a finite-enough way, and so its goals and aims could change over time. But such a thesis cannot, in the first place, follow. To follow his views back to the origins of reason would prove impossible. But even
