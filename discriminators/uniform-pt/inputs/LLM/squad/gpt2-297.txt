 Redmayne and his band were so thrilled when Redmayne and Fannie Lou Eglitt took turns recording for them, that they had to send the duo a letter from the studio to check out Milt Gabler's new recording.

In addition to playing piano with his band members, Milt Gabler had also recorded for various other record labels, including Capitol Records, G.I. Joe Records, The Byrds, The Cocks, The Fillmore, the Grateful Dead, Ringo Starr, and other acts that had their own label. He also recorded with the Grateful Dead, Ring Of Fire, The Grateful Dead, E.M., The Green Mile, The Byrds, The Cocks, Dead Time, Bill Kreutzmann and others.

Milt Gabler's earliest performances with Gershon Park Band had taken place at their famed Milt Bridge Recording Company in Chester on June 17th, 1943, the day after the war.

In March of 1953 Milt Gabler produced his first record recording for The Fillmore after just six months of touring. A few months later, in May, Milt made his first recording for The Feathered Cat at Feathered Studios in Boston, where the band recorded for The Fillmore. They had some long-standing connections to Gershon Park and the early band members of the Fillmore, but they never played together on all of their shows.

Early concerts with Milt had already begun during the War in Korea, and the band had played several shows at the Fillmore throughout the war. Milt Gabler was able to arrange a set during his New York show that consisted mostly of Milt playing with other touring bands around the world. After the war, Milt was able to record in the States for an international concert tour. During this tour, the band performed several shows and several solo recordings, with one session on Feb. 9th, 1960, at The Fillmore.
