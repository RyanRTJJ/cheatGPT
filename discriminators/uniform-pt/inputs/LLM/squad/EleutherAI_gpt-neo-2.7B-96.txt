 time, when Truman had long desired to leave politics and go into the private and diplomatic world of foreign policy that Eisenhower was becoming his prime candidate for such a step, a step which would involve him in the domestic debate on civil rights, Vietnam, civil liberties and other major issues of the era. But Eisenhower refused to do so, insisting in private that he wouldn't do the nation harm by leaving public life. This was only partially true.

When the 1948 presidential campaign began, Eisenhower already was facing substantial difficulty in retaining his old job. After taking the oath of office on March 4 of that year, he was greeted with a storm of criticism, including not only from those like Martin Luther King who had remained silent while he was in the White House, but a wide range of other people, including President Truman. There was so much resentment that during the campaign on both sides to make Eisenhower the candidate they wanted in the election, including a speech by a disgruntled former Eisenhower administration employee who charged the incumbent lacked the character to lead the nation and deserved a "thumbs down." (While the charge may have been aimed toward Truman, Eisenhower himself was by now on record as never having supported Truman's 1948 presidential candidacy.) The accusations by both King and the disgruntled former employee continued on into the campaign.
