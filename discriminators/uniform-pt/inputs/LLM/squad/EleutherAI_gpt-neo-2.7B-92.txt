 with his brother Robert to take Saer de Câline. John would lead 1,200 knights in the advance and then Robert in archers, who would assault the fortress. After fighting one final rearguard action, the garrison of Saer de Câline capitulated. John claimed the surrender as God's judgment on his brother. The crusades also saw the founding of the town of La Rochelle-la-Garenne in northern France.

By 1211, Pope Innocent III wrote to John a letter in defence of the papacy. He described the crusades as being undertaken by the kings seeking the conversion of pagans to Christianity who wanted to return to the faith from which they had been driven. He also stated that the crusades were part of God's will and that God was acting through the kings. Pope Innocent III wrote the letter because the crusading kings of the time felt betrayed by the papacy that John had been chosen over them. Innocent's letter was one of the longest and most lengthy papal letters to a leader of a church to see the crusading kings and had a large hand painted image at the top of the page.

By 1218, during the Third Crusade, the church ordered several castles be re-built and the walls of other castles erected that had been demolished during the First Crusade. Other churches were ordered to rebuild. One of the Crusaders named Frederick I Barbarossa, king of Sicilia, led an attack on the church of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray. Barbarossa is believed to have built the castle and rebuilt the church in Romanesque style. After the Crusades, John attempted to recover the lands from the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem where John also died at the age of 63.
