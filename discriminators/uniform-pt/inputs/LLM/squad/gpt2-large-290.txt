, the majority of whom are employed in film and television, range from film and television writers, actors, production companies, directors, and producers to screenwriters, directors and producers, writers who serve in executive and administrative positions, and more.

Alumni, including faculty, have worked on such acclaimed films as The Wolf of Wall Street, The Boy with a Thousand Faces, and The Last Starfighter, as well as more recent ones as My Week With Marilyn, A Boy and His Dog, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. In addition, more than 90 percent of the original film-writing faculty members and nearly all of the original film-director faculty members have been alumni of Northwestern and work for the films. In recent years, these alumni have been actively involved in film and television productions and have been responsible for some of the biggest movies currently in production (e.g., The Bourne Legacy, The Fault in Our Stars). Although Northwestern films have gone on to become profitable, the alumni have remained committed to their film and television programming.
