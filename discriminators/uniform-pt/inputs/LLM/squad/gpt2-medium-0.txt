The game had been scheduled for July 30, 1969, outside Kansas City, and although the series was cancelled after one game, it would stay on the horizon for another year for another team in the league.

He proposed to throw six innings against the Angels, two runs each. When he called the game to a standing ovation, the next day's Tribune and subsequent accounts, including a later version on the front page of the paper, said "Holtzman's act... was a foregone conclusion." On April 21, the Indians and Angels both announced they were coming to Cincinnati for the game.

It was all so new that the Indians and Angels had to wait patiently for the tickets to be shipped and, when they finally arrived, to find new seats already opened up for them. Soon they found themselves, with only half a day to travel, playing at the Polo Grounds — an impossible venue for an outdoor, one-inning game and in the winter of the Civil War the only ones in baseball with good ice.
