 of Cyprus with Greece as anathematic to their security. Thus, the Turkish Cypriots began to favour independence, based on the principle of bi-zonality. 

The Turkish Cypriots proposed that all political power and any constitutional change should be exercised in a ratio of 70% to the Greek Cypriots and 30% to the Turkish Cypriots. This proposal was rejected by the Greek Cypriots, who argued that it would make them a minority in their own country. 

At the negotiations that followed, the Turkish Cypriots accepted the principle of the Republic of Cyprus. A federal constitution for a Republic of Cyprus was drafted on 11 February 1959. According to this constitution, the two major ethnic groups, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, were to enjoy equal rights and the rights of non-Cypriots would be safeguarded as well. 

The 1959 Agreement was improved in 1977, adding the provision that the Government of Cyprus should be composed of eight ministers: four Greek Cypriots, two Turkish Cypriots and two non-Cypriots. The Turkish Cypriots expressed willingness to live in a common state where there was equal access to government resources and services. 

The Turkish Cypriots have continually sought to establish an independent political entity that would guarantee their sovereignty and security. This has led to the establishment of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, an independent state proclaimed in 1983.
