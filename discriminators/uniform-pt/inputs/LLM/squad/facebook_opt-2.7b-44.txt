 it takes a larger amount of oxygen to make up a volume of blood in a bird.   The birds blood is essentially oxygenated blood, with a different oxygen-consuming compound. For example, birds have a hemoglobin molecule much stronger than humans due to having a significantly smaller oxygen diffusion volume.
This and the oxygen concentration in the bloodstream is also a major factor. In humans, it's about 0.1ppm; in a pteropus the same concentration is 40ppm. A blood gas analyzer will show this, but if you put in some fresh blood straight from a bird vs. some gas, the latter's oxygen content will be less!
So birds are more of anaerobic like fish?   It's also pretty fascinating that oxygen metabolism is very different in birds and humans.  A blood transfusion would theoretically be very dangerous for birds, as they need oxygen uptake/oxidative stress to keep up the circulation without being starved for oxygen.
Birds require a different number of calories to keep themselves alive and healthy. The numbers used were about 10 calories for every gram of fat and about 30 calories for every gram of muscle mass, meaning that they require a far greater number of calories to produce and maintain the same weight and body mass.   Btw, they do need to be oxygenated on a fairly regular basis because of their unique anatomy.
I didn't quite understand how their metabolism was different enough to lead to such a radically different body-mass. Thanks for the input! I would have thought feathers would do a *lot* to
