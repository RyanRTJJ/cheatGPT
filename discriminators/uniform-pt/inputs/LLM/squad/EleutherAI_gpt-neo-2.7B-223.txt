 This strengthening improves neural functions and may even enable certain types of memory that require short term, temporary storage. For example, the brain's memory storage capacity may be enhanced when learning (like in mathematics or using a computer program that requires many steps). The enhanced storage capacity of the neural connections during sleep enables the brain to work at high speed and, thus, allows it to store memories that are in progress, such as math problems which have been solved. Also, by not needing to wait for new information to be generated or new connections to be constructed, the brain has more time for the formation of complex and/or long-lasting memories.
While being awake, memory can be preserved while the brain is operating at high speed to accomplish tasks. For example, a person may remember a mathematical equation when he or she is calculating how to get more gas from the car engine (which is not being driven very fast). When this person turns a key on to start the engine, the memory is retained and the resulting memory improves (with no degradation) to help the person avoid a potential trip in the car by mistake.
A primary component of long-term memory is the hippocampus (also known as the “HP”, or the “hippocampal complex”). The hippocampus is found below the cerebral cortex (i.e., it is part of the brain below the cerebral cortex), and it is in the temporal lobe, i.e., it is under the temporal lobe in the brain. The hippocampus is believed to have both neural and behavioral effects
