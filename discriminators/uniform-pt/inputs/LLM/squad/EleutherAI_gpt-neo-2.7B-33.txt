hausen, the Altm√ºhl Mountains, and, finally, the Black Forest, which occupies the very south.

The Black Forest lies at the heart of this part of the state, but is not farmed today like the rest of the region, as it is mainly covered by forests. Of the three mountains in the Black Forest, the Rothaargebirge also bears the name of Albrecht von Wallenstein, one of the most famous, and enigmatic, princes of the late Middle Ages.

The northern region is one of the many regions that make up Thuringia, making up the largest state in Germany (with a population of 463,823). It is here that Thuringians make up 70% of the population, followed by Germany (around 5%), and Saxony-Anhalt (3%).

Thuringia is the southernmost state in Germany, and is also one of the least densely populated. It is located on the edge of the forested plains around Nuremberg, and the fertile region of Saxony-Anhalt.

Early History

Though the region that is now Thuringia was not formally assigned to the Electorate of Saxony until the early 13th century, its inhabitants were already considered part of the German lands, as evidenced by the name of the Electorate of Saxony. Many of the Thuringian villages were built on the edges of forested plains, suggesting that the area was an important area of forest management. Thuringia was known as the "Land of Wood".

The region's first known leader was Charlemagne, who was named king in 788 over all of what is now Germany. After him, local leaders began to call Thuringia, the Holy Land, "The Land of God". Charlemagne's son, King Ottokar II, made extensive changes to the region's geography. The Black Forest around Regensburg developed in the 8th and 9th centuries,
