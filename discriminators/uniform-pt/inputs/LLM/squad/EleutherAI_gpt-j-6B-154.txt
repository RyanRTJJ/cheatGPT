 analyses: (a) European Y chromosome lineages (mostly associated with Ashkenazi lineages) and (b) non-European lineages". In a 2015 study by Atzmon-Ostrer et al., most of the non-European lineages in Ashkenazia were described as East Asian, in stark contrast to the earlier studies.

In 2007, a study by Behar et al. (referred to later as Behar I) published by the same authors of a series of studies by L. Daniel and S. L. Daniel suggested that the Ashkenazi Jews are descended from an ancestral population of Middle Eastern origin that arrived in the Levant, and then spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean by sea.

The Behar I study of 2007 was cited by Behar and Tishkoff, who supported the hypothesis of gene flow from Middle Eastern populations into Europe. The study suggested a hypothetical Middle Eastern ancestral population of "perhaps" 1,200,000-4,000,000 years ago. Their conclusion was that Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry is of "an Eastern Mediterranean-type population", from a Levantine-type population, and that both populations have "deep ancestry" into Europe.

According to them, the population of the Levant in the Levantines is "a diverse population of people speaking closely related languages and with a broad range of regional cultures; in particular its linguistic variety is not dominated by a single ancestral stock, even among those groups that are now classified into the single linguistic group called Semitic".

In 2011, Behar et al. (Behar II) published another study, this time to "clarify aspects of the earlier work". They estimated that the Levantine population of the Levantine-type ancestral population is  from Middle Eastern
