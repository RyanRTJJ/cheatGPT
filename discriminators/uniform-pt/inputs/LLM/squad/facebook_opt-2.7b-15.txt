   The US, Canada, EU, some European nations have 3 or more parties working together to have a government.   Canada has a coalition of the third place party. UK has a coalition of the third place party and the second place party.
In Canada (and many other countries), the third-place candidate is only required to support the nominee from their own party, not the party that would then receive the most votes.   So, for example, if the Liberals win a majority government, then only Liberals are required to support the Liberals in the House.

It is. But, they know they won't get elected unless they keep their promises.
In terms of an actual democracy though its the "lesser evil" system. If you're going to have a third party, what better system for the candidate to act in the best interests of their party rather than the other party if they've won.
The American system works better. It is "lesser evil" because it forces the "lesser evil" party to make compromises with the other party, which could be good or bad. It doesn't take all three of them.  You could also say this of the Canadian system, with a different interpretation: it actually works as it is supposed to work.
