 he had made friends among the local Catholics and became a valued member of a church in a quiet country village.  He was, it is said, on his way to Rome to see an important document about Mary of Egypt.  This document seems to have been the first to put forward the theory that Mary was Jesus’ mother, though the “document” has been lost.   His mission seemed to follow, and to coincide, with the appearance, just a few days later, on the 1st of February, of the Emperor Julian,  who was also said to be, on his way to Rome to see the document about Mary.   It was now that Athanasius was in his element, as this was the first time that he had had a public platform with which he could make himself known to his contemporaries.

The first part of his speech begins by introducing himself and his ideas, claiming that he is not only the first person to say that Mary is the mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, but that he is also the only one who has put forward the true doctrine of the church.  He claims that this doctrine, which is supported by scripture, has been lost to the world for several centuries, since the fall of Rome, and that his whole work is that of “restoring” it.  He went on to say that the church is now very much disjoined spiritually from the apostles, and that the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus had been replaced by one which stated that Mary was conceived by means of rape.  While Athanasius was in Alexandria, Rome and Gaul he wrote many letters to his colleagues and friends, in which he defends the views that he had publicly put forward,  he claims that it is a great sin “To deny Mary God’s Mother, as if her child had been conceived in error.”  He also goes through a number of other ideas that he believes to be true, such as the virginity of Mary, and the divine inspiration of scripture.  In this speech he is clearly laying his “foundation stone” for the church’s existence.  He has put forward the notion that the church is a “pillar of hope and salvation,” which will bring glory
