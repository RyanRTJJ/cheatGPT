 had enabled the world to view a world without borders through the vantage point of the city block where the English Civil War took place. But that vantage point is still a few thousand miles away. The street above us is still the most significant street in the world, the heart of the city.

I ask Stuart for the last time I visited Stuart on the streets of London before he was laid to rest and buried the body found by Ulf DÃ¶rven for his beloved city. The moment that ulf took his life he lost all sense of connection to his city. That loss was profound and profound for many people. As such, the memory of my own passing was most profound of all.
