ley Field. This section often causes a problem for patrons walking around the stadium. For example, during the Cubs-Orioles NLCS Game 6, there was an incident where a fan went up to an Orioles fan in the other section and yelled out in his language (something in "bleacher bums" is not uncommon in Wrigley Field) before approaching him. At that point, the Cubs fan tried to call security before yelling back at him, asking him what his problem was. Eventually security had to take care of the situation quickly enough so the person at the wrong section of the stands didn’t make it into the stadium.

However, Bleacher Bums may be very visible from a distance, but there is no place to stay or eat before or after games. Bleacher Bums and their families are a special breed of fans, and with some creativity, it is possible to get a spot for themselves and their friends, or for extended family members.

With the help of the Chicago Tribune, we got a little more information as seen in this Q&A about Bleacher Bums and why they do it.

Q: How old do your Bleacher Bums typically are?

A: I am a middle-aged Hispanic man and my son is the youngest. He is 12 years old. I’m about 35 or 36 years old. I don’t know, maybe 30 or 32.

Q: Do they all stay for the entire game?

A: You can stay as long as you want, I think
