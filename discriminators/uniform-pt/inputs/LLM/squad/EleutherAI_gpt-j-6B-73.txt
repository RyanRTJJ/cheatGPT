 morality can be explained not just empirically using the laws of natural selection, but also, in part, in terms of moral sentiments. This means that we as humans experience moral sentiments or aversions towards actions that harm others. These are usually called "sentiments of virtue." These are moral sentiments in the form of feelings, emotions, and attitudes. These can be moral, immoral, or neutral.[1][page needed]

Some argue that certain sentiments of virtue, i.e. aversions, do not explain morality. That is, one cannot explain ethical standards merely in terms of these sentiments. Others argue that the moral sentiments do explain morality, in addition to helping one to understand the biological processes, as a social phenomenon. They argue that the sentiments exist within all humans across the globe.[2]

"Morality" is a very broad term covering different aspects of human behavior:

In general, any aspect of behavior and action that can be seen as ethical (good) or not (unethical; unmoral) is called a moral action. This general term is expanded into the specific sub-aspects of human moral behavior. The latter is usually covered by the more specific, scientific words "altruism", "sympathy", "empathy", "care", or "human care".[5]

"Empathize" is the use of sympathy, or its close cousin, "empathy," to describe being able to understand another person's position.[7] The empathy of an observer can be influenced
