 urea. But, once again, they are no more adapted to excreting concentrated urine than we are. The primary physiological adaptations to uricotolic excretion were likely to be an increase in blood volume (a key advantage of increased renal water retention), and a concomitant reduction in renal blood volume. But we, and virtually all other terrestrial vertebrates, are not equipped to retain that much extra water in the body.

The last characteristic we will discuss here is the ability to conserve and transport glycogen. It is often forgotten that every plant, or at least all major forms of vegetation (e.g., woody vegetation, cereals, and algae), contain significant amounts of carbohydrate. Without this small, soluble molecule required for respiration, one can expect only a minor decrease in oxygen tension caused by the loss of heat through CO 2 -requiring processes such as photosynthesis.

Glycogen is one of the main components of muscle tissue, and is important for several metabolic processes. It is primarily used for transporting water from the blood to the muscle and it serves to maintain pH at a normal level. We know that birds, like mammals, use the kidneys just below the diaphragm to remove glucose (and other carbohydrates) from the blood. The kidneys have complex arrangements of ducts (glomeruli), tubules (glomeruli capitis) and various parenchyma, and can take up vast amounts of dietary carbohydrates while processing them for absorption.

Thus, if we were to hypothesize that birds had
