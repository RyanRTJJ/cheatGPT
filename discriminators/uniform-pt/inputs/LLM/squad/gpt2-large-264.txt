 civil rights movements," he said.


He and three other professors wrote a paper for a National Academies of Sciences and Engineering symposium on the book.


"It's almost a historical artifact," he said. He said it was included in the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, and a plaque will be placed in the museum to commemorate its "important role."


The book was written by two young civil rights researchers, including the then-23-year-old Taussig, said his son, Eric I. Taussig, a lawyer with the Center in Los Angeles.


They were studying in the summer of 1960 in Atlanta when their hotel was bombed, their bus was raided and they were arrested. Their father, a physician, was shot in the chest. They were tried and convicted of conspiracy to violate civil rights and were jailed for a month.


Their parents were imprisoned again months later. All were kept behind bars until they were freed by President Johnson.


This time, Taussig said, he was inspired to write the book.


"It was a great story," he added. "I think it would be fun to write a history of that time, of America, of the civil rights movement."


Their father was not happy with their choice to write the book and pressured them, he said, but it turned out well and was used more widely.


"The work that they did was significant," he said. "They didn't get much attention."
