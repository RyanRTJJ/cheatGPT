It was not until September that Darwin was allowed to see Wallace off, and two of his students who accompanied him on the journey reported that he was unusually tired during the five days of the journey from Batavia to Borneo. It did not occur to them at the time that he was ill.

Darwin had had enough to say during his voyage from England to South Australia. He had reached "the summit of science", and would never again do more than a quick sketch of what might have happened when his brain was stimulated, more fully, by a great naturalist from abroad.

After leaving his companion in South Australia, Darwin took time out to contemplate how he would explain Natural Selection, to people who did not believe that he should be a prophet to predict the future. He was anxious to find the best way to do this, and decided that the best approach would be to treat a theory already developed on a biological basis, but not entirely understood, as a general principle in science. In particular, he chose the mechanism of adaptation which he had recently developed with Wallace, which suggested that some adaptation to new environment would occur if a new species was created with different characteristics. He reasoned that the new adaptation occurred only if the new species was able to take advantage of some new quality
