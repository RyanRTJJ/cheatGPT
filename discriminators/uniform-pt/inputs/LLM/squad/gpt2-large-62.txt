 56 BC. (According to the literary tradition, it is probably in the late third century BC.) The author of the first three lines (which occur in the text) was named by Aristotle as the author of the hexameter, or 'pilgrim's verse'. Aristotle also mentions the "Dorice" in the list of the great poems of the ancient world. We know, however, that the first work, which was a collection of verses relating to a story, was published in 64.

One of the most important Greek poems of the sixth century BC, the Prodicus Rerum, written by one of the most famous poets of the time, the Greek poet Agathocles, bears much similarity to the work of Eclogues. The text was translated into Latin in the 7th Century AD. According to the literary tradition, the Greek poet Agathocles was inspired by a story and composed the verse, which he subsequently translated into Latin. While some scholars hold that the poem is the work of different authors, some scholars have suggested that it is probably the work of Agathocles. One can cite the fact that the original version of the poem cannot be found, that the poem does not end with the words "now this, then that etc." (for example: The poem continues: 'Tho' they love, 'tis not true, They will be taken by the wolves! The wolf, to the wolf's lair (the wolf's nest: the Greek is a corruption of the Greek word apophysis 'place of prey'; the 'wolf' is another corruption of the Latin word wolf, 'deus'),' as well as its title, 'Prodicus Rerum' – in other words, a poetic expression intended to refer to the beginning of the poem, because this is the place where the story must begin (which appears to be in line 4). A contemporary writer, Eustathius, who lived in 598 AD, wrote the title chapter (progeny) of the Prodicus Rerum – so it could be the version of the poem which Agathocles translated into Latin.

The poet Ephorus, a contemporary of Agathocles, said that Eclogues
