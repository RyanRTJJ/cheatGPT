As with many modern space races, the Apollo 11 mission was the primary reason it became an international sporting event. NASA eventually paid millions for the rights which included television broadcast rights for the 1969 Olympics, in which the United States won gold, and as much as $65 million for marketing.

However, other nations, including Russia, were to have their own competing space programme in the future. The Apollo 11 mission was the first of the space race's'mini' events, which included the Moon landing in 1969 and eventual manned lunar landing and return in 1972. After the successful Apollo 11, the Space Race became somewhat more international, with competitors from China and South Africa being invited to represent their nations at the next stage of the sport.

In the second phase of the Space Race, in the mid-1980s, the International Space Station (ISS), was established and included a variety of activities like scientific research, testing of rocket engines, and observation on the surface of Mars. Many nations participating in this race went on to further improve their space technology. On the ISS in 2012 and 2014, it was announced that China
