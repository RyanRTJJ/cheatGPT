 Protector," and led a revolt against the Chinese. This was the last of a series of rebellions led by Rinbung princes, the last of those rebelling against the Chinese dynasty. The Chinese, however, resisted the attacks of the Rinbung princes and with their loss of power, the Tokugawa Shogunate was founded in 1603.

The Tokugawa Shogunate had been established in 1603, more than eighty years after the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate. Since the Tokugawa began to take over military matters, the "civil war" had been in existence for at least a century.

At the time of the founding of the Tokugawa, the Chinese had the monopoly on firearms as well as the monopoly on the manufacturing of most Asian textiles. All Japanese warriors, regardless of whether they had fought for the government or not, were required to wear the standard headgear of the Tokugawa Shoguns for their entire adult lives; they were also required to have a red hat painted red and be permitted to wear only traditional Japanese outfits. In addition to these special regulations, Japan was administered by a large bureaucracy, known as the shoshin kenkai (officers of customs).

During the reign of Tokugawa Ieyasu (1567-1604), there was a decline in the import of spices into Japan, particularly rice. The resulting shortage of food led to the famine that led to the death of hundreds, if not thousands, of children. This lead to a series of rebellion and assassinations amongst the samurai. This was all a result of a change in economic conditions which caused food price inflation and an increase in prices for other goods.

Eventually, the Tokugawa Shogunate became too strong for all the rebellious princes to resist, and war was declared. This was in 1704. This war became known as the Satsuma Rebellions, and resulted in the eventual downfall of the Tokugawa shogunate.
