รถ in the south. The southern coast of Austria and its border with Czechoslovakia are protected by the Mur. There are also numerous mountain ranges; the high peaks of Austria are not much above 14 thousand metres.

Thuringia was also a major centre of German-speaking culture and literature which gave birth to many German names which are still in everyday use today. A good example would be the ancient language of the Germanic peoples, the Germanic languages, the oldest of which are the Celts (Celts), the Visigoths (Vandals), and the Germans. During most of the course of history, the Germans had a very strong tradition of writing in several languages. At most, if the Germans were to have been a people in their own right, then one would know that the German language was the written equivalent of the ancient Latin. Yet today a few Germanic names are still in common usage. In other words, a person from Thuringia could have German, Germanic, or a name connected with certain lands and customs. Since the first centuries of the Christian era and the German language had no equivalent in Latin, some names were not always clear cut. The names of cities were also given according to the territory in which they are found. And there remained some ambiguity in the names of towns, and so upon migration the names changed as the inhabitants were absorbed into towns and villages.

Because the name Thuringia means "land of the dead"(see also "Land of the dead") there is a well-known place named "Lothringen". The German-speaking town of Thuringia (Thuringen ) is famous for its cemetery, situated at the east end of the city. A monument in the cemetery
