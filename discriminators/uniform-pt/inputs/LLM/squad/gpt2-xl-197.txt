 the only private school that consistently beats "public" schools in their results in the TIMSS - the Programme for International Student Assessment, which measures the educational attainment of 15-year-old children.

It is not entirely correct to say that Eton is free. "A number of charges" are applied, which include those from tutors, and from tutoring agencies, which are regulated by the Education Standards Commission (Equalities).

The fees are a small fraction of the fees charged at the leading independent schools. The fees have risen modestly in recent years, and are currently slightly below the fees at the Independent Schools' Association, although this may increase in the near future. The fees are currently set at £2,200 for the five-year year, and are a third of what £6,800-a-year Trinity College charges.

Eton's fees are considerably lower than many leading private schools in the U.S. This may be down to the admissions process at Eton - where students are considered on an exceptional basis, and where scholarships are awarded accordingly.

However, the high admissions criteria at Eton also may explain the relatively low fees. A number of top universities, including Harvard and Princeton, charge well above £12,000. Other schools charge little more than £1,200 for a five-year year. So that is the situation at the leading private schools in the U.S. (although we're still awaiting confirmation from Princeton).

We understand that Eton has just adopted the new 'entry package' criteria, and that for the first time since the school began to admit students they will consider a number of factors related to the student's personality after completing the entry form, including a personal interview, an open-ended question on their "experience" at
