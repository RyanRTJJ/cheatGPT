 the Ivy League school’s dorms named for white supremacist and pro-slavery architect John C. Calhoun. Many felt it was an inappropriate use of Yale’s resources to house students in such a building.

Yale responded to the criticism by creating an Advisory Committee on Calhoun College. This committee was composed of faculty, students, staff, and community members. The committee was tasked with exploring alternatives for the name of the building.

In April 2016, the committee announced its recommendations which included changing the name to “Grace Murray Hopper College”. Grace Hopper was a remarkable American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. She was a pioneer in the field of computer programming and the first to develop a compiler for a computer programming language. Hopper served in the Navy during both World War II and the Korean War. In addition to her service in the military, she was also a distinguished educator and college professor.

203 Yale alumni and 44 additional scholars also proposed that the college should be named after Anna Julia Cooper. Cooper was an African-American scholar, educator and civil rights activist. Educated at Oberlin College, Cooper was the fourth African American woman in the United States to earn a Ph.D. She was a strong advocate for both women’s and civil rights.

In April 2017, Yale announced that Grace Murray Hopper College would be the new name of the former Calhoun College. Yale President Peter Salovey stated that the decision reflected both the legacy of Hopper and Yale’s commitment to building an inclusive campus community.
