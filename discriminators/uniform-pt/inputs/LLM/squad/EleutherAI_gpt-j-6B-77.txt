In some cases, the wrestlers may be tied and the winner is determined by a tiebreaker, typically involving a number of predetermined methods, one for each wrestler.

In other ladder match styles, the winning wrestler may be determined by the wrestler or team who remains, even when the wrestlers compete over the predetermined number of ladder steps. The remaining wrestlers may, for example, remain if the two wrestlers are tied, or the one wrestler wins with more points, etc.

In still other ladder match styles, there may be only predetermined points values or scores (e.g., a wrestler having 30 points in a single match versus a wrestler having one point in the same match) that are awarded to the wrestlers or teams for various actions, including eliminating the opponent.

Other more complex methods of judging an individual match or series of matches may be performed by the organizers and the winning wrestler or team may then be announced at the conclusion of the event.
