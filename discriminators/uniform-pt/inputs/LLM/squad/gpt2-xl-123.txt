, jealousy, sadness, and happiness) and the extent to which the label refers to a particular dimension of one's experience (e.g., "I'm really angry at my boss because I work too hard"). This approach is well suited to the study of individual-level emotional behavior (Lynam & Wilson, 2009); however, it is not particularly robust to individual differences in trait dimensions or context.

A more nuanced approach focuses on the extent of the dimension and the structure that underlies it (e.g., whether there is a core or multiple dimensions), the role that these dimensions play in an individual's emotional behavior, and the ways in which different factors interact to control the behavior (e.g., an individual that's high on empathy will tend to have less intense emotional responses to situations, whereas the opposite is true for those with other strong emotions like anger). This approach offers the potential to more accurately locate emotional processes and behaviors in the complex context in which they occur. Yet, the results of past studies using this approach are inconclusive due to relatively small sample sizes (e.g., a few hundred, or less than 25, cases), the potential for different dimensions to play a role in the same behavior, and the difficulties arising from the potential for differing interpretation and interpretation of data between studies (Weinberg, 2002).

A more encompassing framework for analyzing emotional behavior is the social constructionist approach (e.g., McCauley et al., 1992; Schimmack, 1994; De Leo, 1994; Schimmack, Fink, &
