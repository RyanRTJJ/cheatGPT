 board-only organization is controlled by the board only and has no meeting or elections. A board-only organization could only have a single board or multiple boards. You will need to determine whether you will be a membership or board-only organization.

Membership organizations are governed by the bylaws, which outlines how to conduct meetings, elect officers, and determine and approve the distribution of board fees. Your bylaws give you the power to change the bylaws and may state the reasons for a change as well as whether new provisions will be added. You may find the bylaws a good place to start reading over, as you will probably spend more time on them than the articles.

Board-only organizations cannot make changes to the bylaws, so you will need to consider whether to have a Board of Directors or an advisory board first. Advisory boards make decisions on policies and plans and may make recommendations to the board. Usually, a board-only organization will be much more flexible than a membership organization with regards the creation of an advisory board and its composition.

Other considerations to be aware of are the size and diversity of your organization. The larger your organization, the less power will be delegated to the board. One way to determine the size of your organization, is your budget. Is your organization small or large? In the nonprofit world, there are some organizations with a very thin board, such as a local government. Others are quite large, such as companies and some religious organizations.

The following are factors to consider when deciding which type of nonprofit organisation you are considering.
