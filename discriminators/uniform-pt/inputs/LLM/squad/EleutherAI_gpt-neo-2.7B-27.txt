 launched an uprising intended to unseat the emperor, but they met with harsh resistance. The emperor was not assassinated, but was executed after a few days. A number of other prominent officials then rose in opposition to the new regime, but were also met with resistance. After a few months of civil war, with many of their supporters, including Zhang Zhizhong and Li Keyong, killed, the emperor restored order via a policy of purging all suspected heretics, including men of high-ranking officials. When the purges ended, he then had Zhang Zhizhong tortured and executed by Yang Xingmi, the chief minister of Yang Pu and another key minister during the civil conflict.

Following the fall of the Tang Dynasty, the warlord Li Keyong, governor of Hua Prefect (which took its name from the town of Hua Prefecture), set about taking control of the land in Shaan and in particular of Shaan, which he did in a violent fashion with the death of many in conflict against him. He took the imperial capital Chengdu, but was soon ejected from Shaan by Zhang Zai.

Meanwhile, the Emperor Wu sent his emissaries to look for a new ruler on the other side of the Shan State, to ask the aid of the state of Kibi. After negotiations, the Kibi ruler Yang Guochang agreed to ally themselves with Emperor Wu. The capital Yangcheng was captured and the emperor fled to Chengdu in order to negotiate a better deal with Yang Guochang. However, when Yang Guochang heard of the emperor's flight, he decided to help the Tang ruler, leaving behind much of the territory of Tang to seize the Shaan state for his own benefit, and establishing a new state with Yang Guochang as its first emperor.

After a brief civil war, Yang Guochang and his army defeated the Shanyue armies and restored the Emperor Wu's control over the territory in Shaan.

After the Tang State fell from power, the rulers of Shaan continued to rule by other means. Wang Ying, who had been given administrative power by Yang Guochang (who took over the office of generalissimo to him), remained the head minister of state and governor of Shaan
