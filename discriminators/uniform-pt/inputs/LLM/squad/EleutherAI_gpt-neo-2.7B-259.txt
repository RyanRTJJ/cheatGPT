An international scientific consensus exists for GHG mitigation and carbon dioxide capture based mitigation.

The Clean Energy Council was established in 2001, initially with the aim of providing the Australian Government with the resources, knowledge and infrastructure to increase the competitiveness and quality of renewable energy technologies for the electrical power generation sector.    Its founding President, Stephen Palfrey, said the Clean Energy Council was not the Council for Climate Change and the Council for Clean Energy was established with the same name.

The Clean Energy Council is Australia's foremost peak body for clean energy and its key role is to foster the development of clean energy. As the country’s only peak body dedicated to clean energy, the Council promotes a whole range of sustainable energy technologies including solar, wind, biomass and energy efficiency. It promotes the development of the renewable energy sector through education, research, advocacy and support for new renewable energy technologies.

The Council is led by a Board that reports to a Chair and an Executive,
