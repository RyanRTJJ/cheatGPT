, the Swiss and Italian Alps, and the Swiss Plateau.

Switzerland was once a united province of the Holy Roman Empire. It was united three times, first in the 9th century, and remained a single empire until the 1st and 2nd centuries A.D. When the empire collapsed after the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453, three separate sovereigns ruled: the Canton of Ticino, the canton of Grisons, and the Grand Duchy of Neuchâtel.

The Canton of Ticino contained the most of the population, while the Grand Duchy of Neuchâtel contained most of the landmass. After 1803, Switzerland was divided into cantons and, in 1913, into provinces. On 2 Sept. 1848, the cantons were merged into the Federal Republic of Switzerland. By the 1960s, the cantons had been divided into three regions—the federal Canton of St. Gallen, the canton of Graubünden, and the canton of Glarus. A second regional government, the Council of States of Switzerland, was later created in 1869.

Thereafter, regions and provinces were introduced to deal with political differences within Switzerland, which was divided into federal cities, canton/regional authorities, cantonal governments, and communes/municipalities.

In 1981, the Swiss Confederation (consolidating all the states that had been called Switzerland, under a government that was called the Swiss Confederation) was abolished. On 3 March 1990, Switzerland replaced the Confederation with an autonomous multiethnic federal system called the Federal Assembly. The Swiss Federal Constitution of 1857, as amended, and the Federal Act of 1871, as amended, provide the legal framework for all of the matters mentioned here.
