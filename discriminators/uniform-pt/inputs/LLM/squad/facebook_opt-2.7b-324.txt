 effects of predators on animal populations can be seen. What happens to the predator affects the animal as well. A recent study published on Frontiers in Zoology suggests that not only do predators affect animals like bats and birds, but those effects can also be observed over longer periods of time.

The study, "Long-term effects of human induced impacts on raptors", is published as an official contribution to the journal Frontiers in Zoology, where the article was reviewed by Dr. Kees Kolkman (Utrecht University) and Dr. María José A. Ramírez (University of Barcelona), with additional authors Dr. Dara B. O'Connor (@DaraBou), Dr. David S. C. O'Connor (@daco), and Dr. Jeroen Smic (@jeroen_smic).

Founded in 2005, the journal Frontiers in Zoology provides an interdisciplinary forum for publishing groundbreaking and exciting research and ideas in all areas of zoology. The journal publishes original research papers and review articles spanning various fields including behavioral biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and wildlife management and conservation. To date, the journal has published more than 1,500 peer-reviewed articles.

Bats, birds, and other predators can all be an important part of ecosystems and contribute to the ecological process, but how they work together to maintain balance can still be unclear.

The author of the study, Dr. María José A. Ramírez from the University of Barcelona, and one of the reviewers of the study, explains, "With a recent decline in bat colonies in central Europe and North America, it was important to investigate the consequences of human-induced impacts on raptors in these ecosystems. It was important for us to show that it does not matter what species we are talking about - whether bats, birds, or even squirrels - the effects that these
