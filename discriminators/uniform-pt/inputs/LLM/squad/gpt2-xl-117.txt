The port suffered tremendous losses as ships were sunk, their crews killed, and other ships filled with water caused by leaks. There were also extensive fires. As a result, thousands of jobs vanished. It is perhaps also important to note what happened just after the last bomb hit, the so-called 'Battle of the Clyde':
