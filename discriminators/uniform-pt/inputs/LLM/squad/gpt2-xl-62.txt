 57-58 AD. The first edition was completed around the end of the following century, but it is thought that some copies were stolen by the German authorities. The earliest surviving text of the earliest known verse of the poem, in fact, is a manuscript attributed to the Greek poet Dionysius the Areopagite in the fifth century AD. The Latin translation of the Eclogues, published in 1504, is a direct product of the Latin translations of the Eclogues undertaken by scholars of the time. The first verse and other material not considered significant or necessary to its meaning were removed.[1]The only surviving manuscript of the hexameter Eclogues is that of a monk at Caesarea Maritima ca AD 532, one of the manuscripts of Virgil's extant works that is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, England. The poem is known under these names: the Bibliotheca Perennis (the 'Bibliotheca Virgiliana') written by Caesare Borgia, the 'Bibliotheca Lucreta', and eventually (from about 1450 to 1500) Latinised as Bibliotheca Graeca. The author was also known as Porphyrion (for which we know virtually nothing) and Porpharius (for which we have no contemporary sources - not a good sign). It is an interesting coincidence that at the same time that Latin authors were writing their Latinized versions of Virgil's works, the famous English poets James Boswell and Matthew Arnold made several trips to Italy. They returned to England with an appreciation for Latin literature and with the knowledge that the Latin tradition in the classical tradition had begun and had progressed for some time.James Boswell (1608-1674) had been born into an English family, but he emigrated to France with his family at the age of two. He first became acquainted with Latin around the age of two. His first work was a translation of the play of Seneca. Then at the age of nine, at the instance of his father, he undertook the first translation of Virgil's poems.
