 a target that same year to reduce emissions to a 26% reduction by 2020 in comparison to 2005. Both cities met their targets in 2007.

Attribution of recent climate change 

A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in November 2019 attributed most recent observed temperature and ocean warming to human activities. Analyses indicate the observed warming trend is unlikely to happen without human intervention and that the cause is almost entirely due to human activity. The study also reported that humans added approximately 60 gigatonnes (GT) of carbon dioxide equivalent to the atmosphere from the 1850 to 2018. The study indicated that land use change emissions account for 41% of emissions from fossil fuels, the remainder contributed from the release of previously stored carbon in the ocean. It also showed that land use and forestry emissions have risen in recent decades. Researchers who co-authored the study have proposed the IPCC's 2019 report should take the new study into account when preparing its future report.

The findings contradict prevailing mainstream scientific views. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's "Summary for Policymakers" presented in 2014 that concluded "it is extremely likely increased concentrations of GHGs are the dominant cause of the observed warming since 1950" and "human influence on the climate system is clear", based on the findings of a review of thousands of peer-reviewed publications on climate change science and economics. The researchers who provided the latest evidence that global warming is overwhelmingly due to human activity have been widely attacked by mainstream media outlets as climate change deniers,
