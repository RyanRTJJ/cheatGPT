 copies of his book to Darwin's colleagues, but in the absence of a full translation of the book and in reaction to the limited amount of information that he had, a few Darwin's colleagues began to publish translations either partially or completely based on Darwin's original sources, often to meet the demand of eager Darwinist students. These self-published translations were less accurate, more biased and more often than not without references to the source material. In the absence of scientific sources, the Darwinist community relied heavily upon the interpretation and commentaries of the Darwinist leaders or on more accurate translations and commentary by other Darwinist scholars. The quality of these translations led to the development of Darwinism itself at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

In the 1920s Darwinist leaders published many translations of scientific articles in the press, for the simple reason that these translations were written by Darwinist scholars who were generally writing from a Darwinian point of view.

The 1940s and '50s saw the development of a set of publications that attempted to bring Darwinism up to date in terms of scientific and technological advancements. This led to a period of renewed Darwinist influence in the English speaking world, and the publication of a major translation of Darwin by the British historian Richard Lewontin.

In the mid-1920s Charles Darwin's book On the Origin of Speculation was the standard work for Darwinists to use. As Darwinism was in its infancy, many Darwinists used the book to help introduce material to non-Darwinist students. In the 1950s Richard Lewontin made a translation of Darwin's book on speciation into English that served as a main reference work with a commentary by Charles Darwin
