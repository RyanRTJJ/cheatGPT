It was therefore inevitable that it became a subject for a new theory of race, based on the concept of differences within a given human population. But, for all its scientific and philosophical prestige, the natural sciences proved incapable of providing sufficient empirical data concerning human variability. They thus became the primary source for contemporary racial theory, although it is clear that in reality it is only a matter of time before genetic analysis will come into its own in forensic science.
