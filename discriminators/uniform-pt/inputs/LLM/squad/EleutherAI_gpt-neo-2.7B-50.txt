 exploration usually occurs in an exploratory stage, and therefore, is a natural stage of adolescent self-discovery. However, in the process, adolescents become more independent and more critical of self-perceptions. This makes them susceptible to the internal factors, and self-esteem deficit. With age, identity exploration takes a prominent place in the formation of self-concept and self-esteem. The research on self-concept in adolescents has increased rapidly. Most of the studies have focused on developmental aspects, growth pattern, and changes in self-concept over adolescence, and most of the research is conducted in Asian countries, such as Korea, Japan, and China. On the other hand, in Asian countries, adolescents usually have lower self-esteem than in Western countries, and this is due to the fact that adolescent internalizing behaviors are more common, which further increases their vulnerability for low self-esteem. Therefore, to understand the development of self-concept and internalizing behavior in a more comprehensive way and to improve the self-concept and self-esteem of adolescents are important and reasonable topics for school health personnel. The use of social psychological theory, personality theory and behavior therapy in school health is one of the most important issues in school health, and this study is an extension to these theories.

With high social mobility in recent years, Korean adolescents show high self-confident, self-acceptance and self-esteem ([@B1]; [@B17]). However, as Korean society develops, Korean adolescents show lower self-esteem and low self-confidence than the previous generation ([@B5]; [@B20]). The growth pattern of self-concept and self-esteem of Korean adolescents was similar to that of U.S. adults. However, in Korea, there is a trend of increasing self-esteem and self-confidence ([@B16]; [@B19]). In other words, the Korean students' self-concept, self-confidence and self-esteem increase during their middle school, and then decrease during senior high school ([@B19]; [@B5]; [@B6]). In other words, self-concept of Korean adolescents fluctuates over time.

Korean adolescents in middle and high school seem to have many internalizing behaviors and psychological problems. According
