ua. On August 27, 1876 he gathered a division of 5,600 men in order to prepare the siege of Chihuahua, but for this purpose, only 4,200 troops were stationed at the town of Guadalupe. In early September, Brincourt managed to get his men assembled at Guadalupe. On September 5, Brincourt, with a few hundred additional men, embarked on his boats on Lake Lomas del Rio and started for Guadalupe.

At the same time, the Mexican Federal Army under General Francisco I, was preparing a surprise attack and the main Mexican Army of Chihuahua, which was commanded by General Juan Ojeda, was stationed behind the city. Ojeda's army was commanded by Captain Manuel Antonio Ponce de Leon, (later known as "Old Man Ponce"), a relative of Don Mariano Ojeda (who led the famous Mexican Army during the Mexican Revolution). On September 6, 1876, Ponce de Leon and the Mexican Army, with an advance guard of 300 men stationed in Aguascalientes, started to move toward Chihuahua. Ponce de Leon's forces were accompanied by the Mexican Army of Coahuila commanded by General José de Jesús María Castañeda, with a force of 4,350 men, on horseback and artillery. On September 7, the Mexican Army was attacked by Ponce de Leon and his men, and the advance guard of Ponce de Leon was defeated on September 8 when they came up against the Mexicans.

Brincourt took Guadalupe by surprise on September 11.  In order to obtain control of Guadalupe, Brigadier general José María Castañeda had to make a march of approximately 70 miles (110 km) through Chihuahua State. Despite the efforts of Ponce de Leon and the Mexican Army, Brincourt's men managed to take Guadalupe. On September 13, Castañeda made a general advance against Brincourt's army, but General José María Castañeda died fighting with his men on the 20th of September. After the death of the general, Brincourt's men withdrew to Aguascalientes.
