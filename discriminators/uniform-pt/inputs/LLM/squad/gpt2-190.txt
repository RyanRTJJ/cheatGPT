The first French wine came to Paris from Spain, while the Second and Third centuries were spent there, and were consumed there. The French culture is often divided into two major religions: Christian, and Catholic. The Christian religion was founded in the 14th century and has since spread from France to all regions of the French mainland. The Catholic culture, first brought to Paris during the 16th, took up residence in England, where it remained under the influence of the Confucian and Christian churches until finally assimilated into France in 1714.

The traditional food of both the churches and the rest of Europe, particularly in Brittany, may be considered the original source of the French cuisine and may have originated from the "French family" of restaurants. It is not uncommon to find a number of "French" in many supermarkets, among them in the supermarkets of Le Bourget, Charnel and other towns.

The cuisine of Paris is almost always referred to as "French cuisine." In addition, there are a number of dishes often considered to be French cuisine: pork liver sausage, roast duck, pork stew, poutine with pork fat and saut√©ed vegetables, and beef stew. However, there are also some dishes that are considered to be French. The most prominent of these is fried chicken ("chele de la bonbe"). These are served in restaurants throughout
