Location

Nanjing is located in a long valley, which is approximately 100 miles long, 40 miles wide and less than 10 miles deep. It has an average altitude of 1230 feet above sea level, approximately 200 feet more than Beijing or Shanghai, but less than 60 feet less than Yinchuan, the elevation of which is 1420 feet. By land it's the fourth highest city in China. Nanjing is also the seventh most populous city in China, only surpassed by Beijing, Shanghai, Guiyang, Wuhan, Jilin and Changsha. The city was built on the right flank of the Yangtze River, and therefore it is not surrounded by hills, as other cities adjacent to the river are. Being the right flank city it had no need to build on the valley to save costs. This makes it the only city located on the left-hand flank of a river where there is no need to construct any hillside for the city to grow.

The location of Nanjing at the right flank, also called the Yangtze River-left-bank city, allows it to benefit from Yangtze, river flood and drainage water. On a normal day without the flood the Yangtze water can be about 100 feet deep and the height of several buildings in the city is up to 30
