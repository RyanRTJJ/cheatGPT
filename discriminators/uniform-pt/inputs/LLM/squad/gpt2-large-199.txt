 Aragon, Tijuana, Veracruz and Puebla. Tito was a great hero to his country, and perhaps because of this, he was widely recognized by the country in the wake of his death. The most notable instance of this was the dedication of the city of Veracruz, which was the home of Tito's daughter. The first day of his year on the date of his death, the Veracruz people made a special day to dedicate the city on his birthday (July 7). On this day, a fountain was also opened, and the people, including the mayor took turns giving him one million pesos, or one dollar each. Tito became the patron saint of the city of Aragon and was recognized by his native people (especially in the area of the city known as the Gran Chaparral, which was where Tito lived and where he first began running for president). This is the reason why the state of Aragon is called the Gran Chaparral, after the saint. It is an incredibly good sign (and indeed, it is a historical fact in the case of the city of Aragon) that Tito is recognized by the state as their patron saint. This fact proves that Tito was very much loved by his people. The most famous fact of Tito comes from a letter that he wrote to President Benito Juarez. In this letter, Tito stated that "My dream is not to know how much money has passed me, but that my dreams will stay pure and that I will not turn my back to money for the rest of my life. Money is only skin deep. My life is a dream, and to make it, I only need faith." If
