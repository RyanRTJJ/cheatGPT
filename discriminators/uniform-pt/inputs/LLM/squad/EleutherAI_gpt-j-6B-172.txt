 the double platinum selling Fireball. With Roger Glover now in his fifties, it was time for another chapter.

The album was originally released in 1988 and followed Deep Purple’s 1981 album ‘Come Taste the Band’. With its cover depicting the band’s iconic mascot, we’ve created this unique piece of artwork featuring the full band. The design took the band, their music and their legend to a new destination for many.

Featuring songs including “Highway Star”, “Perfect Strangers” and “Keeper of the Seven Keys”, we’ve reproduced the original LP in a premium polythene sleeve for a truly one of a kind piece of pop culture.

Includes the Fireball album in its original sleeve and the original booklet, complete with original artwork and lyrics, as well as an archive of period pictures.

“It’s difficult to describe the kind of sound, mood and feel the music had…it’s not the usual hard rock sound, but you can definitely hear the Deep Purple influence.”
