 elevator-casualty fatalities among nearly one-million elevators and escalators installed in New York City were caused by people using elevators or escalators to descend or ascend to an unsafe level. An elevator-casualty fatality in a hotel setting, however, may dwarf the elevator-casualty fatality that we expect on conventional subway cars, busways, or elevated train cars. As to a "hotel," consider that the New York Times reported of the New York City death on 4 June 2001, that "a woman and her 13-year-old daughter came to the hotel, where they had stayed, and began eating, before the 11:20 a.m. shift began." The New York City Board of Health subsequently discovered that, in the course of eating a very hurried meal, a person climbed "two flights of stairs" to the fourth floor, where at some point during the meal someone had "gone inside the room and set the alarm for 15 minutes before leaving" in that elevator.

In a report of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA, 2003), an elevator-casualty fatality was defined as "a fatality where the worker was either killed or injured while in the process of making an emergency descent down the elevator, a building's fire alarm sounded, or in the last descent of the elevator, which occurs when the elevator car is moving down at approximately 20 mph from the top of the building." However, the OSHA report identified two separate incidents resulting in elevator-casualty fatalities: one of which was an elevator-casualty fatality on a private business property (New York City) (a) in which an elevator-casualty fatality occurred while the elevator was in the process of an emergency emergency descent, and (b) in which an elevator-casualty fatality occurred because the occupants of the space being entered on the fourth floor were forced into a panic by the elevator-casualty fatality, and a second floor tenant's floor was vacated as a result.

### Elevator-Casualty Fatality and Occupant Involvement

It could be reasonably argued that the definition of "occupant" in a "hotel" setting should be expanded to include
