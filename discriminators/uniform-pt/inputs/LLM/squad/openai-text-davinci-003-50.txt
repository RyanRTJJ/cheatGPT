e typically part of a developmental period of transition, egocentrism is more consistent across different life stages. This is because egocentrism is rooted more in a person's self-image, which is often less impacted by normal developmental patterns as compared to self-concept. Egocentrism typically develops during the adolescent years and is seen across genders, cultures, and backgrounds.

Egocentrism during adolescence can manifest itself in various ways, such as speaking in exaggerated terms to feel superior, expecting to receive attention or special treatment from others, expressing hostility or apathy, or preoccupying themselves with their physical appearance. In some cases, adolescents may begin viewing themselves as the only person that matters, which can lead to further problems in social interaction. Adolescents may also place disproportionate importance on their own thoughts while disregarding the opinions of others, which can often hinder healthy relationships. In other cases, egocentrism can be expressed through exaggerated feelings of sadness, happiness, or anger which are disproportionate to the event.

To reduce the effects of egocentrism on adolescents, it is important for adults to practice empathy and to engage in positive communication with their children and adolescents. Educating adolescents on the importance of understanding and respecting others' views can help to provide a foundation for more mature and meaningful relationships. Additionally, fostering an environment in which adolescents are comfortable expressing their feelings, both positively and negatively, would help to create healthy boundaries and instill mutual respect. Lastly, offering ample support and resources to adolescents can help them to gain self-awareness and better understand how to interact with their peers in a healthy way.
