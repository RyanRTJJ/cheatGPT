as of Bengal, and the Rashtrakutas of Deccan.

The Gurjara Pratiharas controlled a large area of northern India in present-day Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. They rose to political prominence during the 7th century and proceeded to expand their territory over the course of the following centuries.

The Palas were a powerful dynasty based in Bengal (present-day West Bengal and Bangladesh). They were Buddhist in faith, and built a vast empire that stretched across India and into South East Asia.

The Rashtrakutas were a royal dynasty who reigned over the Deccan region of South India. They were active from the 8th to the 10th century, and expanded their kingdom beyond South India into present-day Maharashtra. This dynasty promoted Hinduism and actively resisted the influence of Islam. 

All three dynasties sought to expand their territories, as well as their influence in other areas, such as religion and culture. They engaged in wars and alliances with each other throughout the period, with the Gurjara Pratiharas and the Palas being particularly powerful rivals. At times, they were able to maintain a degree of balance of power, but at other times, one would gain a decisive advantage over the others. Ultimately, no single dynasty was able to completely dominate the region, and all three were eventually replaced by newer dynasties.
