, and authority, egocentrism is a fundamental and stable aspect of self-concept. This is important, as it suggests an important link between self-identity and social identity in the adolescent brain. The neural and behavioral processes described in adolescents with high egocentricity are consistent with those with high entitlement. The developmental development of high entitlement may be linked to ego formation and higher ego-regulatory functions. However, future research is needed to tease apart this link.

Introduction

Increasing research indicates that adolescents need to learn to deal with the negative consequences of their actions. The consequences include the likelihood that they will make poor life choices, will be blamed for their own actions, and will have problems relating to others. However, there are additional negative outcomes of engaging in the behaviors that adolescents need to understand and confront, or learn to cope with and manage. One such negative outcome is that adolescents who engage in excessive alcohol, drug, and/or tobacco use, or poor mental health, may actually do things that help their self-perception. An example of this is binge drinking, which some adolescents think is fun, but others do not.

A third negative outcome of inappropriate, high-ego behavior may be the appearance of high-self entitlement in adolescent children. High entitlement and self-regulatory behavior are often combined in some individuals, making them harder to cope with a variety of emotional and physical distresses when they are abused as juveniles.

The cognitive consequences of adolescents with high self-esteem and high entitlement may be even more severe than the negative cognitive consequences that arise from overly high self-esteem and entitlement. Although high-self-esteem and high self-esteem promote an identity structure that includes authority, self-efficacy, and autonomy, adolescents are still experiencing their identities within the limited bounds of their sense of what constitutes normal competence. With appropriate social, emotional, and behavioral support, a high-self-esteem adolescent recognizes and integrates these core aspects of their identities within their personal strengths and social functioning, including the ability to make decisions and to take responsibility for their actions. Because these adolescents have high self-esteem and
