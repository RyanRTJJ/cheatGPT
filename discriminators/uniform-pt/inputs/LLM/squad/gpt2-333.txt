a (SafÄ«s) while carrying out a campaign to overthrow the ruler of the Nineveh valley and take over the Kingdom of Khurasan, the Islamic State group said that over 600 men (about 25,000 in total) had been killed in a raid on their stronghold, which lies in Qazam. (Safiq, 3rd ed., p. 23.) This group said "these martyrs, including five sons of Muhammed, were killed 'through their hands'; it is thought this is because they had a hand in the conquest of Khurasan by the Muslims. Thus, the fate of these martyrs is very serious. They must die and are on trial."

The statement attributed to Muhammed stated that "the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was not involved as such in the killing of those who had been slaughtered in order to make this war lawful. This is a very different story that Muslims are fighting to end. In many cases, it is impossible for Muslims to win the battle either side and as a result, these deaths were carried out in order to prevent that Jihad from taking place that was to take place which was in the name of Islam. The fact remains that Muhammed and his followers were a part of the Caliphate with nothing to control and nothing to do but to serve Islam (as such). Thus, the Caliphate is really an imperial state governed, by the State of Allah. "
