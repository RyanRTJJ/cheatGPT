 gym for a practice, where he’d noticed a huge, white machine. “I could never really make out the name on the face of the barbell,” he says. “It was so heavy it was hard to lift. But I really liked it.”

In high school, he won a state title in basketball. His high school coach was Bill Musselman, whose players included Joe Lefkovitz, Joe Shumate, and Tom Credeur, who went on to star in the NFL and NBA. “So Bill invited me once, and I just took it,” says Schwarzenegger (pictured above in his playing days, right). They later played together on the 1968 U.S. Olympic basketball team, which didn’t win a medal (in a game against Czechoslovakia):

As a young man who played basketball in a world championship, I was thrilled when the U.S. beat a very strong German team [in 1968] – I was so excited about beating a legend in the old country, no one expected to beat the current world champions. This was also a new era in which no one (including myself) knew who would win.

When he was 24, he went to Los Angeles to play baseball with Phil Rizzuto, who starred in the A’s and Dodgers teams of the 1960s. “We were both the team’s left fielder and closer,” says Schwarzenegger. “We kept bumping knees all the way to the plate from a little infield play we just made.” They bonded with the Dodgers, and Rizzuto and he played together on the 1969 U.S. Olympic baseball team that didn’t make the medal round (after losing to Chile, a team led by the All-Star catcher Vic Fazzini).
