 languages at all levels were a patchwork of Slavic, German and Romance languages. At the time, Yugoslavia had little interest in developing an official language policy. But the political climate after Tito’s death in1980 shifted towards a multi-national approach. As Yugoslavia moved from minority autonomy to full independence in the mid-1980’s, a number of languages became state-approved, which are now considered official languages on that level

While some have been integrated into the national identity and become part of the state, others have often maintained regional identities that are often referred to as “nations”.

Since 1980, several Balkan nations have either become full international members or have gained full national independence. The major linguistic divisions are the Hungarian-, Russian-, Slovenian-, Croatian- and Kosovar-speaking Balkans. It is a source of great contention whether those particular regions are independent, or the nationhood in general, which is referred to as “Bosnia and Herzegovina” but is a rather complex subject that requires a separate explanation.

In Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of Vojvodina prior to independence. Tito’s Yugoslavia split Bosnia into two entities - north comprised Serbian-speaking areas in Kosovo and western parts in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the southern region was named Republika Srpska. The two entities were not considered independent until 1992.
