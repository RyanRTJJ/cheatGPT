 to the area. Hideyoshi, having established bases in the South China Sea, was concerned that Japan would be involved in a war with China if it came. On March 1, 1598, a Japanese fleet under the command of Admiral Kizaru (賴垣) sailed out of the island of Hwangju (南沢). Hideyoshi's army took the nearby province of Hwanghae (新水), while another force, under Admiral Takakage (永康) moved up alongside to the port of Changchun (長中). Hideyoshi's forces were now in danger of being cut off from China.

According to a diplomatic dispatch, sent by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in August 1598 at the head of his army, Hideyoshi urged Japan to abandon the southward movement towards China without delay. By 1599, Hideyoshi was in Tientsin. He was preparing to join the main Japanese army and begin the march through China towards Tientsin. His forces were attacked by a force commanded by Korean general Kyōtoku (伊鳥), with assistance from Korean pirates and Japanese rebels. This force was defeated at the Battle of Chokho (興蛊), in northern Korea, on August 10, 1599. The victorious Korean King Yi and his regents took over the throne of Korea the following day.

When Hideyoshi's army finally entered Tientsin on September 7, it found Kyōtoku and his army entrenched in place and ready to defend against the invading Japanese. The invaders were joined by the Chinese. As a result, Kyōtoku refused to retreat, although he requested that his army be allowed to withdraw. The battle went on until Hideyoshi retreated with his army with its troops intact. He remained in Tientsin as the Japanese army returned home.

During the campaign, Hideyoshi had lost a lot of his power and prestige in Japan, as well as that of his dynasty. For his part, Hideyoshi spent a considerable amount in his efforts to repress the opposition to his rule.
