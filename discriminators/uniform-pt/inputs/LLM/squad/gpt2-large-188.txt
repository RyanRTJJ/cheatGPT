NS ), which can be placed on either side of existing neutral sections and at the same or slightly more distant feeder stations. NS sections act as a natural buffer and prevent any imbalance of power between feeder stations. They are also effective in preventing the occurrence of "trouble zones." The most effective location provides a continuous low-voltage power supply at a distance from feeder stations, so that the line to the feeder stations will not be interrupted by potential ground losses. Most equipment uses Neutral Sections for this purpose. To properly locate a Neutral Section, it is necessary to locate the feeder stations either directly underneath and directly to the right of a Neutral Section or on the side of the Neutral Section. Some equipment requires both Neutral Sections and feeder stations. A common example of equipment such as this is power amplifiers which produce their output between feeders. They have a second amplifier stage located on the opposite side of the Neutral Section and is called a "Tunnel." The Tunnel is a high-voltage ground-in-place device which prevents the connection of a power line to ground beneath or in front of a Neutral Section. It works best on equipment with a direct drive (drain to ground) or to ground-in-place devices which don't have a drain-to-ground. To connect a direct drive load, make sure the equipment is in the proper location and connected to the correct ground (i.e. supply and not ground). If you make sure you locate the power amplifier correctly and have the appropriate wires for the impedance of your equipment.

Ground Faults

Ground lines must be of a level sufficient to prevent damage to ground, and they are normally found only at the ends of transformers. These are usually made of steel or copper, and in almost all cases they
