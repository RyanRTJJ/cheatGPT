 Islands from 15 December 1854 to 22 December 1856. As Darwin's personal assistant, he sent Wallace a parcel containing not one but four separate parcels. Wallace knew all this; he shared it with the members of the Committee on Migratory Species of Fauna and Flora, which had been established a little while before on 19 September 1854 to prepare for a conference on the subject that Darwin, and later Charles Darwin himself, would be attending. Wallace's letter is the shortest in the collection, and is the best of the collection (even if it is not particularly elegant, even though Wallace did not appear particularly fond of handwriting).
