 of experiments on how to keep it safe and how to destroy it". Dr Charles Moore, chief engineer at the laboratory was a leader even at the time in developing a system of "kill-drop" bombs from which the US has become famous.


In other words, the US wanted to create an army of drones, missiles and missiles, so that it could then use the drones to destroy the whole of Iraq when those drones went off (there are an estimated ten thousand drone bases in Iraq, or about a quarter of the nation). The US wanted to use them to destroy Baghdad using their own nuclear bombs, which are so expensive they might be almost as good as the US has had itself in its nuclear arsenal. This was a "dirty war" planned not to kill anyone, but to destroy Iraq, like the German and Japanese bombings of Tokyo in 1937, the French Fochs, the German Luftwaffe's raid on Britain's submarines, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941, and the British raid of Denmark in 1940.


There are two main types of drones that can be produced - the manned weapons systems, called "UAVs", and the airborne, unmanned systems, called "Aerial Bombardment Vehicles", or "AVMs". And they are different in different countries. But these drones, like the US-made F-35, are "man-able" drones and are
