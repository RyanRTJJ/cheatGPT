 and the functioning of cellular processes such as metabolism, intracellular transport and signal transduction. Energy homeostasis---i.e., the control of metabolic rate---is central to the maintenance of organismal health. Metabolic homeostasis is usually characterized by the balance of energy intake and energy expenditure that is achieved through multiple interacting processes acting on the organismal level. These include the interaction of multiple genetic systems with the environment affecting both the physiology and development of animals including growth, sexual development, maturation and reproduction. Changes in energy intake and expenditure will also be influenced by metabolic changes in different tissue compartments. For example, changes in the relative rate of energy intake are usually characterized by an increase in energy expenditure ([@bib8]) that can become quite dramatic from a decrease in food intake.

The balance between intake and energy expenditure is a key feature of an animal's metabolic rate. The maintenance of energy balance is achieved through the integration of numerous metabolic signals that are integrated through a system of coordinated neuroendocrine mechanisms ([@bib15]). These neuroendocrine mechanisms are often thought to act locally or at a tissue level in the regulation of energy expenditure, e.g., controlling the release of energy stores in the endocrine system of a tissue (e.g., liver or adipose tissue) or the activity of neuronal cells that consume energy and release their energy
