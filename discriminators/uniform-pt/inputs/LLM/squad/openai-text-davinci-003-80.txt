On 26 June 2015, the jury handed down its verdict and all six were found not guilty on all charges. After the verdict was announced, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) issued a statement saying it had “carefully considered the matter” and “applied the Code for Crown Prosecutors in making its decisions”. The statement went on to explain that the CPS felt that “on examination of the evidence, there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction”.

Although the defendants were found not guilty, the trial in itself was significant in that it was the first high-profile case in the wake of the phone hacking scandal which had engulfed parts of the British press. The trial brought to light the often murky world of journalistic practice, and highlighted the sometimes tenuous relationship between journalists, public officials and the information they seek. The verdict is widely seen as a victory for press freedom in the United Kingdom. While the case was seen as a test of the criminal law in this area, the defence focused more heavily on the evidence gathered during the police investigation and whether that evidence was sound. The defence argued that the evidence was not strong enough to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and the jury accepted this argument.
