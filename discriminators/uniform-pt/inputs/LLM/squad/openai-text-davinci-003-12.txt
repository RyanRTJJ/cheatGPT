o cave in Thessaly, Greece. This site is located around 45km south of the modern city of Larissa.

The earliest known agrarian societies in the region were Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, who began transitioning to a Neolithic economy in the latter part of the 7th millennium BC. This transition saw the domestication of animals and the cultivation of plants for food and other purposes.

From the mid-7th millennium BC onwards, the Neolithic livestock husbandry and crop-farming societies of southeast Europe spread rapidly across the region. Valencian sites such as Cova Negra in eastern Spain offer a glimpse into the early settlements of the 6th millennium BC from across the Mediterranean basin.

By the mid-6th millennium BC the region had already established trade and cultural exchanges with the Near East. This is evident from subsistence tools such as pottery and tools discovered in this region which indicate strong connections with the Anatolian and Levantine civilisations.

Other evidence of these exchanges includes the spread of new types of skulls across this region which indicate the arrival of new genetic material from the Near East. This migration of people also brought with it new ideas, tactics and methods of farming, including the use of irrigation systems, which has subsequently been utilised to produce the abundance of cereals, vegetables and fruits so prevalent in southeast Europe today.

This period of migration and cultural exchange is known as the Neolithic Revolution, and it has been suggested that it was a driving force behind the development of agrarian societies in southeast Europe.
