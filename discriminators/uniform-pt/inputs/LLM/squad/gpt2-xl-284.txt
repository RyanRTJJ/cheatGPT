, the conversion of molecules in the cell, the control of the cell's functions such as metabolism and respiration, and for all the chemical reactions within the cell. Energy is also utilized for the storage and transfer of energy among components of the cell (proteins), for movement of energy within the body and in the environment (vascular, nervous, muscular), and for the transfer of energy between cell, molecules, and organs and tissues (intracellular and extracellular).

Bioenergetics (chemical reactions) Edit

A biochemical reaction takes place when the components of a system—from a chemical reaction to movement of molecules, cells, or organs within the cell—change, from a state of partial equilibrium (called the equilibrium state) to a more energetically favorable state. A biochemical reaction also takes place when an item of the system—a chemical, such as an alcohol molecule, a single ribonucleotide, or a hydrogen compound—is converted into another substance such as a molecule of DNA or a peptide, and this transformation takes place via the process of polymerization, or when some energy-rich molecule in a system, such as a compound made of nitrogen, is converted into a weaker molecule, for example, oxygen, which in turn is converted to carbon-based molecules. Many biological systems have energy requirements when they are performing their normal maintenance functions when they are in an altered state of their equilibrium
