 of The Origin of Species to people he respected, and also arranged for transcripts of lectures which he gave in Oxford, Cambridge, and the Scottish capital, Edinburgh.

One of the main problems with translating Darwin's work was that certain concepts and references may not have an equivalent in the translated language. For example, some references to mammals or plants that are found in the UK or the Americas may not have an equivalent or have different associations in other countries. In addition, metaphors used in The Origin of Species may be difficult to render in a different language without altering or distorting Darwin's original meaning.

Another problem which arose was with biased translation. In an effort to make Darwin's works palatable to the local culture, some translators deliberately left out sections of the text or changed the tone of the text to support their own agenda. This is particularly prominent in religious contexts, as some translators sought to tone down Darwin's work to make it more acceptable for those with religious beliefs.

Finally, there were issues with the accuracy of translations. Translators may not have had a full understanding of Darwin's work, or the translator may not have had enough time to thoroughly review the translation. The use of archaic language also resulted in some translations being inaccurate as the translation of words from old English could be a challenge.
