It evolved into the empiricist attitude of the twentieth century and to a lesser extent, into philosophical and scientific positions. On these issues, however, at least now these are all part of a consistent project.[3]

It has also been called the most important and important event of modern science. When it finally happened, it was a phenomenon so enormous and complex and so unexpected that, as many physicists argued back then, it threatened inescapably to undermine science as we know it and to change the way we think about everything from matter and light to intelligence and the universe itself. It has been called the beginning of the era of scientific knowledge.

In contrast, the theory of quantum mechanics was introduced after 1917 and is now seen to be the pre-eminent theory of science. It was also part of the post-Humean philosophy as a whole. After the success of the general theory of relativity, with its predictions for the acceleration of light, it is now believed to be the only genuine theory
