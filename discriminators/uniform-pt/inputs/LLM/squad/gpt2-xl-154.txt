 analyses"â€”the Ashkenazi (European Jewish) and Sephardi (non-Jewish) Israeli groups.

Atzmon is a well-known advocate of an alleged genetic connection between Ashkenazi Jewry of Eastern Europe and indigenous Europeans of the Altai mountain region in Central Asia. In an interview on the Arava News Channel with a geneticist who specializes in the study of genetic ancestry of Ashkenazi Jews, Atzmon said, "There is a direct genetic link between Ashkenazi Jews and Western Eurasians, or those with the closest ties to the Middle East."

Atzmon was not satisfied with the results of genetic studies stating that, "In recent studies, a direct link between Ashkenazi and Israelites has to be proved." While many authors argue that "a direct genetic link" between Ashkenazi Jews and East Asians is a "myth," in 2006 a team from UCLA discovered that Ashkenazi Jews were actually quite distantly related to the Middle Eastern populations they lived with. The scientists discovered that the genetic similarity between Jewish populations was actually quite wide, which allowed for such a striking divergence to develop.

There is a connection between Sephardic Jewry and indigenous European Europeans, or those with the closest tie to the Middle East.

The study was conducted by Dr. Lawrence Cohen and his colleagues at UCLA. They analyzed genetic results from more than 2,000 individuals from the UK and Israel and from populations in Spain, Germany, Italy, France, Greece, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and the Caucasus. Their results revealed a strong genetic homogeneity within all the populations with the lowest degree of genetic clustering at the populations' genetic "hotspots," the
