The way to be saved is to understand that a ruler has no power at all... he can only protect his own followers or those who serve him for hire. The way to accomplish all things is to attain Buddhahood... and then the leader can take orders directly from the Supreme Law-Giver (Tse-ma).

This was the foundation for the whole organization of Buddhism in China before it was exported to Japan.

During that period of time, the Rinrokhs had a great and lasting influence on the history of the country. They were highly respected in the imperial courts and during the fourteenth century, when Buddhist reform was in full swing, they found themselves at the top of the throne's hierarchy. To their disciples the Rinrokhs were the "perfect teachers" (jing-tse-chen); to their enemies they were the "sons of a demon" (shen-yin).

They had become "great gods; powerful and wise," they were "the gods of the east," the "sons of heaven," and were "possessed of the power to destroy the three worlds." These gods were well known to Chinese people—though the most popular legends of them today are from Chinese folktales and are of no real scientific value. Some were not so well received, though: the one called Daodejing ("World-Old Man") was widely distrusted, and was at times even called "the demon who hates good people." His reputation as a destroyer of the three worlds was exaggerated, as is also the case of the most famous of all the Buddha's disciples, Avalokiteśvara, who was accused of being the destroyer of the three worlds—but he was never formally denounced to any official authority.

The Rinrokhs (as in the case of other Buddhism sects) were not like those who practice the "heretic" or "chaos-tao" schools, which maintain a "universal" or "unseparate" world in which there are no differences or distinctions: in practice,
