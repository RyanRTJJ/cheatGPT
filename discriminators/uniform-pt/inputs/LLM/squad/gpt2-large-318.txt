 to the level of political and social leaders. However, the first major migration of Armenians from their homeland was with the Ottoman Empire to Turkey. The majority settled in Anatolia—which was divided among the Turkish, the Maronite and the Greek empires. The great majority of the second half of the 19th century also went to Turkey. After the first half of the century, this flow was almost immediately stopped. In the end, Armenia was left with only two main groups: the indigenous Armenian populations of the southern Armenians and the Armenian refugees that fled to Lebanon and Greece. Armenians in Anatolia and those who escaped to Israel, however, found the opportunity to build a new life for themselves there. The Armenian population also has a very strong presence there. The total number of Armenians in Turkey and in other parts of the Balkan Peninsula is in the tens of millions. It's estimated that the Armenian population number between 5 and 10 million. There are 3,500,000 Armenians in Israel. For that reason, the Armenian genocide is one of the most difficult stories to tell. It's one of the most controversial issues today, in particular it is being heavily debated throughout Europe and the world. This means that it's very important for the Israeli society to understand the Armenian experience, and to remember the genocide in a way which is still clear and clear to them.
