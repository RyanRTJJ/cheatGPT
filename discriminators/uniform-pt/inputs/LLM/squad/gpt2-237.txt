 could create gravitational fields that gave rise to gravitational waves. In 1789, his theory was accepted as an explanation for dark matter's disappearance, and its influence on modern physics began to appear. In 1836, his theory of the universe was accepted by the National Academy of Sciences.

After his death in 1886, Arago was a celebrated figure in the French philosopher Voltaire. By 1838, he was the subject of several works in the American Renaissance titled, "The French Philosophy of the Revolution," which became a national book of the late nineteenth century. In 1849, The Philosophers' Companion to Political Science, a collection of his essays and lectures, was published. In 1851, Arago became the honorary deisser of the French Academy of Sciences, where he was professor of sociology and economic sciences.

"No man is truly an artist and no man is wholly materialistic. He will admit this and will attempt to hide it so as to make his discoveries impossible."

In 1855, William Morris proposed that the laws of physics be applied to all phenomena, and that the "matter in question must move along a uniform set of laws of the universe." In 1857, he announced the creationof a new theory of the universe calledthe Theosophy of Light, named after him as a scientist who saw all the laws of physics as coming together and creating "the world of light as it appears." In 1877, he published The Philosophy of Life, in which he stated that there is nothing to which it will conform, and that an individual can freely make the laws of existence without any interference from the world.

As early as 1853, however, Arago's influence on the theory was waning. He began writing articles and articles on the doctrine of "materialism," when he described his theories of materialistic thought as "materialism in the old sense, to be reduced to nothing at present," while emphasizing that physicalism and materialism, that is, materialistic thought, are incompatible and dangerous to us all. Arago's articles became a popular volume in the English school of philosophy, particularly in 1851, and the publication of the philosophical, historical, and philosophical histories of Aristotle, Leibniz, Spinoza, Schopenhauer
