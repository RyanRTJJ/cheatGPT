i.e., they form an oxidized or reduced complex on molecules present; for example, oxygen and iron forming iron-rich complexes) but they may also be carcinogenic, particularly in humans. Most are water-soluble and therefore cannot form insoluble complexes with drugs which form insoluble complexes with water. If a drug, for example, is dissolved in a solution including free radicals, it may be attacked rapidly (e.g., within minutes or hours of being administered or dissolved).
Free radicals in water-soluble drug compositions are usually removed as contaminants by dilution (e.g., with water) or filtration.
To protect such drugs from such attack, a formulation containing free radicals may generally be treated with antistatic materials to reduce their activity. Such antisite materials may be applied by conventional means to reduce the toxicity of the drug formulation, reduce contact or absorption of the drug by the skin or mucosa, and to reduce the rate of drug degradation.
It is also known that the amount of antisite may itself exert a toxic action, possibly by producing a reaction generating free radicals and a compound may also be produced. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the treatment of formulations that contain a large amount of free radicals by an appropriate antisite may cause a rise in the concentration of a cancer producing, or mutagenic, compound (Moss et al., Chem.
