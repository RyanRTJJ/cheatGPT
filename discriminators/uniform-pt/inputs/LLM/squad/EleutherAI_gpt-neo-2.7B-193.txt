 and matures, his or her relationship with others gradually changes from an exclusive one with an individual, to a more multilevel relationship. To what degree a relationship with another person is maintained and to what degree the individual experiences autonomy is often affected by the relationship a person has with the others. Previous research has pointed to adolescent social sphere changes in terms of peer relationships, the individual's role in the peer relationship, and how the individual behaves in the peer relationship to affect the adolescent adolescent's social development (e.g., [@B22]; [@B25]). However, empirical studies of relationships and social development only tend to focus on either parent--child or adolescent--child relationships ([@B26]). Because relationship processes are multidimensional processes that involve both social context and individual processes ([@B32]), it is necessary to study individual and contextual factors that are associated with these processes. Furthermore, although researchers have paid great attention to the individual-level factors that affect relationships with peers ([@B16]; [@B33]), far less attention has been directed to how contextual factors are related to adolescent social sphere processes ([@B25]). This current study sought to better understand how the adolescent's relationships with friends, parents, and family members affects his or her perceived social competence during junior high school.

As a result of changes in adolescents' relationships, they sometimes experience a decline in self-confidence because they are no longer receiving support from their primary caregiver(s) (e.g., [@B9]). Studies have also shown lower self-confidence among adolescents who have greater friendships with peers ([@B15]; [@B28]). To address these problems, there has been increasing interest in how the relationships with peers serve as supportive resources for adolescents in the school and family arenas. These protective factors among families and peers not only enhance adolescents' psychological resource and self-confidence ([@B8]), but also play a critical role in school adjustment ([@B1]). Because parents and peers play such
