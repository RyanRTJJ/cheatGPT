He suggested the possibility of such a "nuclear winter" (as many had predicted, due to the danger of the bomb, but by the next winter at least); but he said no such winter would happen, since they were worried about Britain and its allies. He then proposed that bombs used against Europe by American troops should not be detonated by the Soviet Union, with the rest of the globe to be shielded from the cold temperatures. This was the only realistic way of achieving such a peaceful solution, he thought; indeed, it was probably the only realistic way in the 21st century. An effort was made, however, to find a solution of this "narrow" problem. In May 1948, The National and the National Association of Police Officers in England held an unofficial meeting.
