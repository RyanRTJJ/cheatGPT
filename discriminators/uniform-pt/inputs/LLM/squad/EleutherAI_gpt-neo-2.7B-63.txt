 of chemical experiments designed to create an agent capable of disrupting missile defence systems" in the event of war. The documents suggest that the Defence Department's laboratories used the substance known as "Project 112", which contained a toxic substance developed and tested by the Army Chemical Laboratory.

The report said that the tests on the chemical substance were aimed to determine the "potentially lethal effects" of exposure to "substances" over prolonged periods on human beings. The chemical substance known as "Project 112" was a precursor to a more deadly toxin known as mustard gas that was used by the Germans during World War II, and in the Vietnam war period. The results of the Defence Department's experiments using Project 112 were revealed by The Guardian on 26 February 2002, about three months after the report's original publication.

The report says that:
"According to the documents, scientists at the Ministry of Defence's chemical defence lab, including the chief of the programme, Peter Withers, were responsible for creating Project 112, which was tested for its effects on various species of animals prior to its experimentation with humans in 1939 and later."

"We estimate that since 1939, the Ministry of Defence has had access to these documents, which are stored in security-sensitive offices at the Ministry of Defence," [the Guardian] reported.

Since then, the Defence Department has denied any knowledge of
