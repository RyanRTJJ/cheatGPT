 with the work of Cyril of Alexandria (c. 340–379) and continuing with the work of Basil the Great (428–386), Orthodox historians have recognized the role of Mary in the salvation history of Christ's church. In addition, early Western writers recognized the role of Mary in the historical drama of Christ's ministry. For example, during the early second century the Greek writer Athenagoras wrote about Christ's visit to Mary and the infant Mary and their immediate encounter with the Son of Mary: "All was silent, and the whole world was astonished [ττάξεις] as if they had seen a new creation of Christ, who was born of another woman." [1] The story of Christ's ascension to heaven, for example, is told to Mary alone, and she is also absent for a significant portion of the events that take place "after the ascension." The Virgin Mary and the disciples have no direct role in the ministry of the risen Christ. [2] Nevertheless, one Orthodox historian has acknowledged the role of the Virgin Mary in "sustaining the apostolic community since its inception": Christ's return to earth "was completed in the person of the mother of the Lord, during the week which followed His birth, in the form of a miraculous manifestation of the grace of Christ in the guise of the mother of the Lord, namely, the Mother of God (Acts 5.3; cf. 5.5), for the purpose of carrying the message of salvation to human beings.... For a single hour, this Virgin was the witness, the intercessor, the protector; until the arrival of the Lord, she performed her mission only by means of an invisible grace, which she conveyed to the apostles only."
