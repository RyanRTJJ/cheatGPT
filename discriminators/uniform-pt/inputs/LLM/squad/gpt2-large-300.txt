 hills. Before the enemy moved out, the French had gained a defensive advantage, and they defended the slopes with a series of strong positions. But on 13 September, the British cavalry, supported by the cavalry guns, opened up the main road, and an assault had to be made. More than 20,000 soldiers were involved in this fierce fight. The British were on the offensive, with a strong division and four field-guns. They had been waiting, but when the Germans, having broken through French lines in the south-east of the Ardennes, tried to follow their advance northwards, the British cavalry, with the help of the guns, pushed them back nearly 15 miles. By 17 September at least 40,000 French had surrendered, although not all who had volunteered, so that around 11,000 of the army were still in France. The British had held that line between 1 September and 13 September. On 12 October, the French, having lost the Ardennes, were defeated at Carentan, and were then obliged to retreat from the whole of Western Europe, including Britain.

On 21 October the British and French combined forces, in pursuit of the Germans, which was unsuccessful, though the battle took place in an area which was quite isolated from the rest of the continent, and was in no way comparable to what had happened in the Ardennes. The British received a tremendous blow in the east and north of England
