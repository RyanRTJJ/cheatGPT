 only remaining '98 announcer was Tom Shavano. A vocal sports fan for most of his life, Shavano began playing the piano in his teens growing up in Cincinnati, Ohio, and the only thing more significant than his career as a music journalist and writer were his two passions â€“ hockey and broadcasting. Shavano's legacy to the game continues with his contributions to numerous pro and college programs, many of whom have continued the tradition of broadcasting games to this day. Shavano received the "Bobby Fischer" award by the NHL in 1993 and was selected to appear on several College and World Series Championship Series games, including the 1980 Boston Red Sox to the 1989 World Series champion Washington Senators. This year's awards will be presented at Boston Sports Hall of Fame in 2012. We thank Tom Shavano for bringing his passion for hockey to life through his lifetime of passion for and contributions to broadcasting. A special tribute from the BSHO Alumni Club was performed, honoring Shavano on June 18.

To date, more than 11.1 million people have attended over 25,935 Hockey Night in Canada broadcasts. As an avid hockey fan, Tom Shavano was inspired beyond words when he learned he would be appearing on NBC's broadcast as "The HNIC Man" on March 5, 1999 as an analyst. The event was an enormous honour for the hockey world. A short, elegant tribute song from The Rolling Stones entitled, "You Belong With The Ones Who Play," included Shavano's famous introduction. Tom's story on NBC, in fact, came to fruition during that same broadcast.

"I'll be damned if this is not my greatest accomplishment since becoming a hockey fan. I got in the NHL with the Rangers for the first time in 1993 playing for the St. Pats on the road versus the team from Buffalo! The only reason that wasn't more fun than an evening on the lake (in the woods) with some buddies of my mom's was that I didn't get to see one game last year." - Harry Caray

Tom enjoyed doing what he loved and doing what he wanted for all he was paid to do. He was never satisfied and never became content. The NHL Hall of Famer was always hungry
