 of the Prakasam and other areas into South India and extended its boundaries across the region. South India's population is estimated to have reached a peak of 12 million throughout the 15th century, with further estimates peaking between the 19th and the 21st centuries. It is estimated that between 300,000 and 400,000 people were living in South India at the mid-19th century.

By the middle of the 20th century, however, the area had shrunk down to just North East India, with little north India left beyond this. Over the years, however, South India's population increased significantly. To understand this growth, we must move towards the country at a very early stage in our history. Many regions of the country were yet to be settled. For example, Jammu and Kashmir, Balochistan and Sindh and Andaman and Nicobar Island did not come under the sway of the British. Even Gujarat remained a largely unsettled state. South Asia also had a relatively undeveloped and fragmented economy at this time. During the 1790s, the British introduced the country's first national currency in South India, the British rupee, also known as the 'babaash'. They used this currency as a unit of exchange to trade with countries like France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain. The rupee was replaced by the Indian rupee (1869), which was still in use until the 1980s, but which became obsolete by the time of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. In 1871, one rupee began to be traded around the world, but only in British rupees (later renamed the 'babaash'), and other currencies were in use.
