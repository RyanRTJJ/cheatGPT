 human beings are not simply products of the environment, that they are the result of a complex history and evolution over the past 10,000 years. The main argument they offer is that people's "lifestyles" have changed since that period, that their social structure has changed, and that their ability to change their cultural behaviors through natural selection changes. Their arguments suggest that this is no mere coincidence.

This discussion about human genetic history and evolution is the topic of a number of books.[11]

Anthropological studies have tried to discover how the "evolutionary" patterns that have been seen in societies have affected and are affected by all humans living on that planet as a species.[12][13]
