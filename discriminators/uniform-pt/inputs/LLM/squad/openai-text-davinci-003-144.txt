e region was widely seen as a "zone of peace" during much of the conflict. Its neutrality, however, was tarnished by several episodes, including: the Battle of Monte Santiago Pass in January 1937, in which both sides fought for control of strategic mountain pass, and the Vimianzo incident, in which local Nationalists killed several dozen Republicans, who had been invited to visit the town for a baptismal ceremony. There was also a “sterile” zone on the border between Galicia and the Basque Country, where both sides refused to engage each other militarily.

In general, despite its neutrality, Galicia was not immune from the effects of the war. Parts of its economy were damaged due to embargoes imposed by the Nationalists, while its civilian population suffered due to the presence of refugees (both Republican and Nationalist), who often ended up flooding the region's already scarce resources. Additionally, local resources such as food and fuel were frequently requisitioned by military forces on both sides, worsening the plight of the region's peasants.
