inue to practice traditional Armenian culture, such as speaking Armenian and learning and performing traditional music. Armenians also have a presence in cities around the world, and have established numerous churches, Armenian language schools and social organizations. 

Armenian enclaves, such as the Shengavit district in Yerevan, are growing in communities outside of the traditional homeland. These enclaves often provide a strong sense of community and provide a shelter for the diaspora, who are able to find places to share and preserve the culture. Diasporas also allow Armenians to maintain their freedom and autonomy, and often help them become part of the bigger picture within their respective countries. 

In some countries, such as the United States, Armenian Genocide recognition and education has been especially important. Many Armenians have advocated for greater recognition of their history and culture, and are forming alliances and organizations to speak out against continued denial of the Genocide. Organizations like the United Human Rights Council, created to promote education and recognition of Human Rights, continue the long-term effort to ensure the Armenian Genocide is indeed recognized by the international community. 

The diaspora also allows Armenians to join together and form networks that extend beyond the traditional homeland. Through online and in-person networks, global Armenians are able to connect and share their stories. Additionally, through groups such as the Armenian Technology Group, Armenians have been able to launch innovative projects which have increased their global reach and impact. By strengthening these connections, Armenians are better able to preserve their culture and build new bridges in spite of the challenges that exist in the diaspora.
