 ago in ancient Greek medical texts. The first modern treatment was developed in 1883, and subsequently a series of drugs have been developed, each one more effective than the last. Many antibiotic drugs have been developed and sold between 1970 and present day. Although antibiotics are now the leading cause of human death by infection, many medical professionals are skeptical of their effectiveness, believing that many of them have become over and above what nature intended. In this section, we will look briefly at some of the major questions about antibiotics and the evolution and development of antibiotics.

The origin of antibiotic drugs antibiotics are derived from bacteria that are used to manufacture them from. In most cases, bacteria are living organisms, and so they do not have the capability to synthesize antibiotics in their own bodies. To get the antibiotic drugs into a bacteria, the microorganism must be grown in special media. This process is called biosynthesis. Over the years, a number of antibiotics have been prepared. The development of these is the result of various events. Some antibiotics were discovered without any known pathogen. Other drugs needed to be made so quickly during the growth process, so they were developed very early in life. Other antibiotics have developed in combination with other drugs, such that the combination has the best chance of acting well
