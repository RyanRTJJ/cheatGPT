do de Tejada. As a politician and leader, Lerdo de Tejada strengthened the secularization of the state, the concentration of powers in the executive branch, and the protection of civil liberties. He also advanced the modernization of public administration and the consolidation of the liberal reforms through laws such as the General Law of Education (1876) and the Law of Amparo (1874). 

In 1876, Lerdo de Tejada ran for president in the first Mexican election after Juárez's death. He was ultimately defeated by his opponent, Porfirio Díaz, who was supported by business owners, conservative groups, and the military. 

After leaving the presidency, Lerdo de Tejada, who had been unpopular because of his economic policies, was persecuted by the government. He was forced into exile in the United States, where he died in 1889.



Despite his exile, Lerdo de Tejada's legacy remains in the modern Mexican legal system. He contributed to the foundation of a modern and fair judicial system, supported the legalization of civil marriages and divorces, and extended access to education and health services. His reforms directed government toward greater perception of social democratic values, improved the system of public education, addressed problems in the political-administrative structure, and promoted important measures in the context of human and civil rights.
