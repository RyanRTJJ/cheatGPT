 systems, to adapt the organism to environmental conditions. Therefore, emotions are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the anti-stress systems. This is important because emotions are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the anti-stress systems.

When an individual is frightened, the hormone cortisol is produced, which in turn is related with a reduction of the anti-stress system hormones. This reduction results in the fight-or-flight response that is related with an increased heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate.[@b1-prbm-7-117],[@b2-prbm-7-117] These changes are directly related with a reduction of the anti-stress system hormones.

There are also different emotions that produce different cardiovascular, respiratory and immune changes that may result in a pathologic process. For example, sadness produces a higher blood pressure, cardiac output, and blood and tissue pressure changes in contrast with fear and anger, which do not cause any changes in blood pressure, cardiac output, and blood and tissue pressure.[@b3-prbm-7-117]

Some studies have shown that anger and fear, for example, reduce the activity of the HPA axis. Moreover, there are many other physiological effects, such as the production of endogenous opioids, which increases the release of endorphins and reduces the synthesis of stress hormones such as cortisol.[@b4-prbm-7-117] Therefore, these changes cause an opposite hemodynamic and endocrinological response pattern compared with sadness. Fear is one of these emotions that has many physical effects. For example, fear causes an increase in the heart rate (the heart beats faster than with anger), which increases respiratory rate, causes diaphragmatic breathing and inhibits cough, and consequently induces a change in the inflammatory process that results in an increased secretion of the inflammatory enzyme. In addition, fear causes an increased arterial
