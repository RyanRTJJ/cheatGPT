 inevitable. Luftwaffe bombers now had access to the skies over much of the world, making them more effective in this regard than Allied bombers.

The Luftwaffe did manage to cause a few major setbacks in UK and US air supremacy operations. In World War II, Allied bombers could operate from several bases of the Atlantic Basin, while the Luftwaffe could only operate from bases deep in the North Sea. However, from the onset of the Luftwaffe's operations the latter did manage to secure a large part of German air space. In June 1941, the Luftwaffe attacked German-held French airfields on four consecutive days, causing considerable damage. In the summer, RAF aircraft attacked German airfields on nine consecutive days, though with the Luftwaffe not yet fully entrenched in eastern Europe, all six attacks on September 28 and 29 came without the French Air Force in any way protecting the Reich's air operations. The Luftwaffe also experienced a few major successes in this period through its use of Soviet-made P-38 Lightning aircraft and its ability to transport bombers to Norway and Iceland.
