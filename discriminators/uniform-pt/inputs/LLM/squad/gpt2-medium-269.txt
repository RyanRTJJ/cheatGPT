 of the desert is very fertile, though most of the surface area is covered with salt pans with little sand and gravel. Some sand and gravel covers parts of the desert. An estimated 95% of the surface area is dry. The land surface is relatively high in vegetation and water is readily available.

As the population increased during the first millennium BC the population in the area of the Pampang, south of Lake Bumilong is said to have doubled in size from 5,000 to 25,000. Most places also experienced increasing numbers of nomads from around this time, and many nomads settled in the desert. According to historical accounts, the area is inhabited by different tribes and clans.

During the last decades of the nineteenth century, around 10,000 people were buried in a limestone-lined pit in the Gia Nga area and two dozen were shot to death with their hands placed over the head in what were euphemistically called "death hunts." The pit was believed to contain between 25,000 and 40,000 human souls. A local legend maintained that their killings were intended to make Bumilong into "the desert in the east."

Although the population had begun to decline during the mid-nineteenth century it continued to fall rapidly for several years. Since then the population has recovered somewhat, but the Pampang area still has a substantial number of desert nomads who lack access to medical care and the occasional hospital.

The first census took place in 1866 and the area, containing about 40 per cent of the territory, contains 5,921 inhabitants. Since then, 6,711 people have been buried in the Pampang area and 779 in the adjacent area of Hougang.

A detailed geomorphology of the area is under way at Maitri Dam.
