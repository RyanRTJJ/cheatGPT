ch is the notion that rather than having fixed and natural components, identity is a flexible and ever-evolving concept. This idea has implications for social, economic, and political life, as different types of identities may be essential to success in different contexts. For example, research has found that people who possess multiple identities, such as those based on gender, race, ethnicity, class, sexual orientation, and religion, can be more successful in the workplace than people who only possess a single identity. In addition to success, identity-based research has also shown that people with multiple identities are able to take on and accept different aspects of themselves, looking at the complexity of different aspects of the self rather than only valuing a single part of their identity. This has implications for systems of power and oppression, as it encourages people to evaluate and recognize multiple aspects of identity rather than only reinforcing uniform characteristics. Identity can also shape people's sense of belonging and citizenship, as well as how they interact with people from different backgrounds and who possess different identities. As such, identity-based research can help scholars, practitioners, and policymakers better understand the social lives of individuals, which can lead to more inclusive and equitable outcomes.
