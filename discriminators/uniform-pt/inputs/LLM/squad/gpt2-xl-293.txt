chvareevsk and Shchvyaz) have been in a state of constant conflict with those of the German-speaking people who lived alongside them. When they fought during the Thirty Years' War (1337–43), the vernacular language was replaced in all major towns and most villages. At least four of these vernacular languages have been revived: Šište (now in Polish and Czech; the other two are žeští and Slavoje), Ladino (now in Ukrainian and Russian; the two other are Výlk and Slov. Slav.), and Drevné (now also as a Slavic language; the other two are Šiští and Slavyansk). Many languages are slowly (and at times, painfully) recovering their original, native, and native-sounding forms or are in the process of re-colonizing their respective lands.

[ 43 ] The Czech-Slovak culture is characterized by its traditional values, which include traditional family structures, a healthy lifestyle, respect for the environment, traditional folk songs and literature, and a strong religious awareness. The Czech-Slovaks have a rich culture and numerous cultural traditions, which they have absorbed from their Czech neighbors. The Czech-Slovak culture is widely recognized around the globe for its strong adherence to tradition and their traditional values. The Czech-Slovak language is very closely associated with these values, along with the folk culture, the national and religious identity, and personal identity.
