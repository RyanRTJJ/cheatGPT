 of some sort. When the tram drove across the current, its electrical system (which was typically a few hundred volts) was drawn across the current from the third rail. The voltage would drop sharply, as indicated by the spark at the rail connection. One would also expect to hear a brief humming or rumbling. This was called "the hum." If the current was more than what the third rail could carry then the third rail would seize up and all the voltages would be lost. Most of the time this took place between the last few metres of the tram and the nearest major ground, but it is also possible for the third rail to be affected by the localised current at any location.
These tram were fitted with current-limiting devices that shut the current at the spot where the current was drawing too high a current. I cannot remember what these devices were called, but my current limiting device from my childhood, which was designed in the '70s and '80s, was essentially a rubber plug, with a tiny hole in one end and a plug on the other end that plugged onto the battery, and worked best in damp, sandy or muddy conditions.
They also had to be able to be tested in the field as the connections that powered them up or down could be lost. I believe you could take the current limiting device with you and attach to the rails a short length of copper wire, one end going into the device and the other into a socket, and then you could test the device. After you had connected it up, you could power up and shut down the current limiting
