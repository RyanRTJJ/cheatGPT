 general, species range expansions into new environments, driven by climate change are one of the major influences on the rate and spatial scale of invasion ([@b23]). Human mediated introduction of an organism to a new environment, in combination with natural dispersal, is one of the major mechanisms of new establishment and persistence under changing climates ([@b15]; [@b47]; [@b5]). The ability to successfully establish invasive species is therefore often directly related to the number of new habitats (new environments) available, with more introduced species being able to establish and persist ([@b15]; [@b12]).

Climate change strongly influences the success of introduced species by changing the distribution range of their main climatic requirements, such as temperature and precipitation. The effects of climate are predicted to be especially strong for invasive plant species because of their slow generation times compared to vascular plants ([@b25]; [@b11]; [@b48]; [@b48]; [@b49]). Climate change and invasive plant interactions are considered to be very complex, and therefore they are often investigated separately in an attempt to reduce the complexity of the issue. However, the outcomes of the effects of climate and interactions between climate and invasive plants (e.g. [@b6]; [@b3]; [@b33]; [@b36]; [@b11]) on the establishment and persistence of species (invasive species) depend on the interplay between climatic conditions and the biotic characteristics of the invasive species, their propagule size, and the dispersal mechanisms ([@b25]; [@b8]) and the interactions of both processes on the distribution range of
