 about 12,000 years ago), with a few small, relatively flat basalt plains in the west and an extremely broad volcanic plateau in the north and east. The total elevation of the island rises to about 993 m (3,265 ft) above sea level.

There are four major peaks of elevation above 900 m (2,953 ft): Mont Pelée's top (1,086 m); Mount Longdon (939 m) and Mount Pellew (910 m). The main town, Jamestown, is on the island's northeast coast. It is situated on a plain between the eastern end of a river valley and the base of Mont Pelée.

Saint Helena Bay

About 8.5 km (5.2 mi) east-northeast of Jamestown, Saint Helena Bay has an area of almost 3 km2 (1.1 sq mi). It is a large, relatively sheltered natural harbour, formed by a submarine volcanic cone and the westward extension of a long ridge of basalt. It measures about 18 km (11 mi) along its north-south axis, and rises to about 170 m (560 ft) above sea level.

South of Jamestown is another volcanic cone, Pellew Bay. Named after the captain of the HMS Pellew, this is the largest of the bays on the island.
