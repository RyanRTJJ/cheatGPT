 four wrestlers compete to win a championship belt by eliminating the other three wrestlers from the match; or by winning the number of points earned until there is a winner (the number of points awarded may also affect the winner). In more recent variants such as the Steel Cage, the cage or other area outside the ring where wrestlers are confined may change into additional areas based on the number of matches in that match or that event in which a certain number of the competitors are eliminated. The cage or other area outside the ring where the competitors are confined may have a special surface to assist the wrestlers in escaping (e.g., a mat or a large ring mat) or with specific scoring conditions or requirements for the winner (e.g., one wrestler must pick up a steel bar or a steel ball and move it over a certain distance to win).
Wrestlers also may compete against one another in other matches that require them to use various skills such as quick thinking, teamwork, or skillful maneuvers. One example of such a match is the Elimination Match, where competitors use their wrestling skills to eliminate any other competitor in the match before they can be eliminated themselves.
