Both were arrested and Johnson himself was shot to death, leaving only a bullet in its chamber.

Three weeks before the Mancs' robbery, a fourteen-year-old runaway girl, Mary Jean Smith, disappeared. She had been sold as a concubine to a man of "foreign extraction" in Albany, New York.

As the weeks wore on, more clues were discovered. Her clothes appeared to be worn, and her hair short. On 21 May, the girl's father notified Smith's stepmother of what had happened.

On 27 June, the Smiths turned themselves in before Colonel Henry A. Lawrence. They told him that the girl's father had been murdered by his wife, who had learned of her whereabouts from a prostitute. Smith and her stepmother, who was a convicted prostitute, confessed to murdering him, with the two remaining accomplices, William R. Leutgeb and William M. Johnson. Smith was sent to Arkansas and Leutgeb to New York for trial and execution. Smith was the first white woman to be executed in Arkansas,
