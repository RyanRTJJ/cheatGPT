 (孔忠真実), formed the Warring States period of Chinese history. Between 522 and 221 BC, Wu (and later, Shang) controlled Northern China, while Liu Bei (彭匣, Liu Bei Chih) ruled Southern China. Liu Bei conquered Wu's capital, Luoyang, and killed Wu Sangui and Shang (in 527 BC) thus ending the Wu dynasty.

However, both Wu and Wu Yan (滅洞, Wu Yan Lü), the founder of Wu, had earlier in the reign of the Warring States era been vassals of Liu Song, the first king of Liu Song, and the first to establish power among the "Great Han" rulers of China. Liu Song's reign ended in 550 BC when the Wei dynasty began. Wu Sangui had a brief, unsuccessful, and ultimately brief reign as king of Luoyang and then seized political power over Wei, before being defeated by Liu Bei. However, during his reign China was briefly united with a number of small northern Chinese kingdoms that shared with him a common northern Chinese identity and culture. As a result, the southern Chinese character 南 became the traditional designation for northern China after this period.

Liu Bei's reign has often been seen as a period of relative peace, prosperity and cultural homogeneity within a chaotic Chinese political situation, although it was also at times marred by civil wars during which Liu's son Cai Wei sought to take advantage of internal chaos caused by the deaths of many emperors. Cai was later overthrown by his nephew Wang Hong, a powerful former general.
