 the Sangamagrama Kingdom with the decline of the Cholas and the political instability in the country that occurred during the Pandyan Kingdom under the reign of Kulothunga Chola I. During his regime, Jayasimha Siddharaja, succeeded to the throne of the empire. This happened because of the death of his son Narasimharaja III who ascended the throne even after being defeated by the empire in the naval battle of Thiruvucode Naga (1337–1338).

After the reign of Jayasimha, the empire and subsequently the Empire of Vijayanagara expanded its borders, conquered neighboring kingdoms and consolidated its control throughout the south-west portion of the Indian subcontinent. The empire ruled over the south coast of India (south of Tungabhadra river) and also over regions as far as the Vindhyas.

She had a daughter Nisamaladevi by her second husband. After Rajakatte’s death in 1332, Narasimharaja III ascended
