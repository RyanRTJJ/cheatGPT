 North American colonies saw renewed American naval and British sea raids. At its height, the War of 1812 resulted in over five hundred casualties and $100 million in civilian losses and property damage. The British also began building a fortification and fort at the mouth of the Niagara River at the easternmost part of the Lake Erie Basin. Construction of the fort began in August 1814; however, its completion was not ordered until after the conclusion of the War.

The battle started in July 1814 but, for reasons unclear, the American advance was halted by British musketry near a creek in the woods. Despite this setback, the Americans launched an ill-coordinated assault against the British outpost, with no success. As a result, American casualties were high. Several hours later, the battle ended with both sides retreating from the field.

Although the battle was a strategic victory for the British, their fortifications were never completed. In fact, the fort was never armed with artillery and never served as a military stronghold to repel sea raids or American attacks. During the War, only two British ships sailed past its moat and cannon.

The Siege at Fort Erie

A few months after the American victory at the Battle of the Thames, Washington and his officers saw two major obstacles on the road to victoryâ€”reinforcements from the British army, and a potential blockade of ports such as Detroit and Buffalo. During these months, the U.S. army was largely a collection of independent frontier militiamen operating throughout the territory. However, the army that was organized would not see major action until after the Battle of Queenston Heights.
