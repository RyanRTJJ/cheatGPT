omo Casanova's 15th century Villa Auditore.

Blore, as the artist was known then, was an influential and powerful force and a huge collector of works from the period, including the famous Renaissance marble staircase.

In the early 2000s, the building was almost completely demolished to accommodate the construction of the South Bank Centre at Clerkenwell with a new tower to replace one of the original buildings at the top.

The tower was completed but still lacked a balcony so the building was left partially open to allow people on the street to view the view from the new building from which the original tower had been removed.

Since 2001, work has taken place on the ground floor, including work on the original fire place, an extension to the kitchen and an extension to the roof.

The extension to the fire place – originally part of the north wing of the building – includes a fireplace, which was installed in 1873 and was later moved to the east wing.

It stands inside the courtyard, in front of the new East End London Bridge.

Work also continued on the original kitchen, which had been used for several years by the National Railway Museum.

The building is well known for its paintings including works by the artist, as well as decorative work such as those by Vincent van Gogh and Rembrandt.
