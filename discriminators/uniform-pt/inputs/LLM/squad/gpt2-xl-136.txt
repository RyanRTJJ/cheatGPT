 Hidalgo was still only 22 years old when he became President of Mexico in 1821. The idea of Hidalgo having made Mexico the country it is today could not have come from the man himself but was instead a result of his policies. His policies included, but were not confined to:

Reforming the government of Mexico.

Strengthening military power and building what he considered as strong armed forces.

Building roads and canals in an attempt to ease the migration problems and bring those in need, like his daughter, into the United States. This would, however, require money, which he attempted to find.

Restraining local culture and preserving or allowing for the growth of the country's larger traditions like Cinco de Mayo. [14] [13] [11] [10] [9]


The History Channel's A Million Little Pieces, the TV show that "debunked" Heraldo's claims regarding his father's legacy, actually did a great job exposing many of the myths and misconceptions behind Hidalgo's name. It goes in depth as to how Mexicans celebrated their Cinco de Mayo, as well as Hidalgo's actual legacy of being part of the first "Hispanic President" even though its been proven that he didn't do much that was impressive.
