onale for this "Partition of Bengal" was that the large and populous province of Bengal was difficult to govern due to its sheer size and population, and that there was increased tension between Hindus and Muslims in the province due to the mutual distrust between the two religions. The split of Bengal was especially contentious due to the hindrance it would cause to the Bengali people, as it would require them to travel further for administrative purposes, would divide the province's resources and its interconnected economy, and cause difficulties for students wishing to attend universities in different parts of the province.

It also galvanized the Indian nationalist movement. The partition spurred increased feelings of Bengali nationalism among the natives in Bengal, as well as a growing Indian nationalism among both Hindu and Muslims in the region as a whole. This was evidenced by the extensive civil disobedience movement that formed in Bengal in opposition to the partition, in which both Hindus and Muslims united to protest the measure. In addition, the Indian National Congress, which was formed in 1885, became a powerful vehicle for Indian nationalist sentiment and led to further uprisings against the British. The Partition of Bengal event ultimately helped to fuel Indian independence movements and contributed to the eventual independence of India in 1947.
