 which called on corporations to make corporate tax avoidance a "top priority".

Last year, she joined the group for a similar mission, but in a different way – with the aid of a charity called In The Belly of One. This grassroots group has since raised nearly $40m for a combination of direct donations and fundraisers hosted at home. The goal is to have an entire season of the TV show Dancing With The Stars in one year, which Beyoncé has been vocal about wanting to join.

In "I Am a Singer", which premiered during the Grammy's, Beyoncé told The New York Times of her ambition to conquer the Billboard charts in 2015: "I'm looking forward to going to the US and seeing how good at making this big song that we all know the song for is. And once we do something, I will tell you all about it".

"I Am a Mother" has come a long way from its humble beginnings. Despite a budget of only $10,000 (£5,000), the production costs were a relative bargain. In July 2011, producer John Legend took over as the sole voiceover artist for the production, but he quickly moved out of the way. The singer and the songwriters had been dating for a year and Beyoncé was thrilled at the decision to finally commit. "It was pretty easy, after I found out his name, to start shooting with him," says Gervais. "I think I'm starting to love him after a year or two."
