 September 27, 1959, the Soviet Union's Alexei Leonov, a twenty-five year old student and a doctorate in mathematics, conducted one of the first spaceflights. It lasted 2 1/2 minutes.

As the 1960s progressed, other countries began working on the spacecraft required to send men and women into space. By 1972, the United States had a spacecraft in space named Vanguard, and it was ready for the launch of the space Shuttle. On September 18, 1980, the space Shuttle Columbia took off for its first test flight. But within the year, as a result of shuttle accidents, its development and readiness had been brought back to life. On September 29, 1990, the Space Shuttle Discovery launched, becoming the fourth shuttle in history, and later a permanent space station in the outer Solar System. With its completion, humanity had sent men and women into space seven times, and, if the Russian Space Program were successful, it would send humans into space on eight or nine occasions during the period 2000 to 2025.

The following is a summary of the seven times men and women have entered space from 1945 to 2019:

1945:

In January 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with the goal of developing and testing spacecraft and spacecraft that would send people into space. The first unmanned spacecraft to be controlled from another spacecraft was designated SPW1, after Saturn's first moon of Titan, as was the first satellite sent aloft. It was, however, not put into space. On December 11, 1945, the last remaining
