 were unavailable, and which is probably one of the few authentic texts in the Western Semitic tongue. Indeed, at the time Sulami's work was translated into a language different from the "the world" Sulami and other Sufis had developed, Sulami's texts began appearing in the English language. He called the Sufis "the people of all things" (Tigr) and "the wise men and women that are the most enlightened beings, and among them are called the gods... And that they are more in tune with and better than the people of the world, so that the people of the world live through the life of happiness, and by their will are made good through their will."

The Sufis in the West are thus represented in all of Sulami's Sufic traditions, especially his "Tigr" (the very name of a branch of Sufi philosophy). That is, as discussed in some detail below, Sulami's Sufism (or whatever sense means) is not merely a literary or philosophical term, it is one of the more striking and diverse phenomena of the West to date. Sulami's writings, or any of his works, as he calls them, are always an expression of a complex set of principles, but that is how he is really understood:

"...we do not just come here to know what the sun is, what is the moon, how the moon shines, what is the sun shining. When the soul is in a state of being, it sees all things, including the body, mind, eye, and body.
