 Points." At the same time, the city, an important center of the automobile industry, experienced a remarkable revival. However, in the years immediately following World War I, a devastating pandemic claimed the lives of hundreds of residents of the city's largely immigrant immigrant areas, especially in what has become the popularly referred to as the "Little Italy" district of Detroit. Detroit's immigrant neighborhoods were also among the city's most segregated, a major reason why the city remains one of the most racially segregated cities in the nation.

This exhibit presents an overview of the Great Migration, from the period of 1862 to 1920. It focuses not only on the historic changes experienced by Detroit's immigrant communities, but also on the broader immigrant experience. Visitors learn that the history of the Great Migration is part of Detroit's story. The exhibit looks at the contributions of Italian immigrants to the city, and the many challenges and successes their families faced in trying to get by as they made the transition to a new country, their first language, a new culture and a new land. Visitors will also learn how Detroit was transformed, in the early 20th century, by the influx of Germans, who came to the city seeking asylum, and the many German immigrants who settled in Detroit's neighborhoods.
