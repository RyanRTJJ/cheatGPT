 dogs. The animals hunted are mostly smaller species of small size that inhabit small and forested lands. Several species are hunted in the forested areas, including the red-necked wallaby, the red-eared duck, the banded quail, the green monkey squirrel and the red colobus monkey. These animals have small ranges, are hunted with limited tools, and cannot escape from hunters. Many of them are hunted in dense, tall forests, but in some areas, particularly in areas where large tracts of high mountains provide shelter, these species also occur. Some species are hunted in the floodplains, while others occur in the floodplains and open wooded plains. In addition to wildlife, hunting is practised as a means of sport. Hunting with firearms is mainly practised for food and for the purposes of war.

In some areas hunting has been in use for several thousands of years. The hunter can carry a bow with a small bow and arrow, and use a spear to hunt small game including small birds, deer and smaller mammals.

Citation styles

Encyclopedia.com gives you the ability to cite reference entries and articles according to common styles from the Modern Language Association (MLA), The Chicago Manual of Style, and the American Psychological Association (APA).

Within the “Cite this article” tool, pick a style to see how all available information looks when formatted according to that style. Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.

Because each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates. Therefore, it’s best to use Encyclopedia.com citations as a starting point before checking the style against your school or publication’s requirements and the most-recent information available at these sites:

Modern Language Association

The Chicago Manual of Style

American Psychological Association

Notes:

Most online reference entries and articles do not have page numbers. Therefore, that information is unavailable for most Encyclopedia.com content. However, the date of retrieval is often important. Refer to each style’s convention regarding the best way to format page numbers and retrieval
