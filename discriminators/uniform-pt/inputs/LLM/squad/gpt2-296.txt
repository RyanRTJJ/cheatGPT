After a series of earthquakes, a volcanic eruption in the eastern half of the island occurred in 1790, causing a small and small amount of devastation as a result of volcanic activity. This eruption was relatively minor due to the fact that the sea had already retreated, with no serious damage due to the event that affected the entire island.
