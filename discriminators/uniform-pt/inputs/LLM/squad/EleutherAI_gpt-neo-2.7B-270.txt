Ireland has good soil but it can be highly variable in terms of soil composition due to geology; there are soils with little topsoil and some with heavy clay. However much of the land is cultivated, and the lack of rain and its effect on the soil composition should not be much of a problem.

The climate in Ireland is characterised by the hot summer of mid-June to late July and a long, warm, almost sultry summer, with little rainfall. The main influences on climate in Ireland at this time of year are the eastward flow of the Irish Sea and the proximity to the ocean, meaning that the climate is influenced by its proximity and not the influence of the land. It is then generally cooler than the coast and by mid-July may be hot and sultry.

The average annual rainfall is 300mm, with peaks of up to 600mm occurring in late August. This is quite typical; the southernmost location in Britain is Lough Neagh, with a September mean low of 9°C and an October low of 15°C. It is the least southerly major city in Britain. The last three months of each year see a general warming in Ireland, to be most noticeable in the months of May and June. It has been noted this has a strong influence on local tourism.

The climate is strongly influenced on its southern fringes by the proximity of the Irish Sea and therefore
