 existence from any given believer. Knowledge transcends individual thought and opinion.

For Popper, it was important to distinguish between objective claims about knowledge and subjective opinion. He maintained that knowledge should be based on evidence, meaning that subjective opinions should be tested, verified, and falsified by rigorous and objective experiments. He was critical of the notion of “absolute certainty”, as he believed knowledge was always provisional and could be amended as new evidence arose. 

Popper thus advocated a falsificationist approach to knowledge, according to which established theories should be rejected if any single new observation fails to fit the predictions based on that theory. He also argued that hypotheses should not be accepted as true simply because there is “no known evidence against them”, but should instead be continually questioned and tested in order to improve our understanding. Popper's concept of objectivied knowledge thus reflects a commitment to critical evaluation and scientific inquiry.
