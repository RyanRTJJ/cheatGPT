 harm (pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections) are widely recognised and accepted, others, 
such as cyberbullying, sexting, and objectification of their identities, remain largely underacknowledged. Risks associated with emerging sexual identities include gender discrimination (through gender-based violence, such as harassment and bullying), sexual exploitation, and moral panic (due to the potential of the internet to amplify negative responses to gender and sexuality). In addition, emerging identities may cause confusion and conflict with family, friends, and peers; lead to mental health problems such as depression, loneliness, and anxiety; and disrupt academic achievement and career aspirations. 

To address these risks, interventions and support services must be targeted to vulnerable adolescents. This involves engaging with families, teachers, health professionals, and social workers, creating safe online spaces, implementing appropriate digital media literacy programs, and providing young people with education and accurate information about healthy sexual relationships, sexual health, and the potential risks associated with their developing sexual identities. Other initiatives could include creating digital portfolios or peer-to-peer counselling networks to provide knowledge and resources. Finally, guidance and support must be given to adolescents in order to help them make informed decisions and feel safe, secure, and empowered to fully exercise their rights as sexual beings.
