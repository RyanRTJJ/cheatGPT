Tito was called the "Iron Man of the Resistance," for his courage in standing up to the Vichy regime in Portugal at the beginning of World War II.

At his funeral, which was attended by both Portuguese and foreign dignitaries, Tito was buried in the Panteá in Lisbon. An immense crowd of mourners gathered under the statue of the Great Tito in the Plaza da Memória, where other statues of prominent socialists were also erected, including that of Tito's wife and, later, of his son Miguel, who would have been twenty-one at the time of his father's funeral.
