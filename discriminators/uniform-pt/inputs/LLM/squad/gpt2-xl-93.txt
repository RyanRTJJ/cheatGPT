 about the origin of Ashkenazi Jews. It had some reservations about certain genetic markers but concluded that "while we cannot rule out the origin of these lineages in Europe, it is unlikely to be from outside the region" â€” in fact, he said, "we have recently identified this same group from the same region as a modern Jewish community in Israel."

Mr. Richards, based out of University College London, has made his findings public through an article in the journal Nature Genetics. What he shows is that the Ashkenazi Jewish population can be traced, statistically at least, to Europe and is related to all other European Jews and, very plausibly, to people living today in Poland, Ukraine, Russia, the Balkans and the Middle East. These findings, Mr. Richards said, "demonstrate unequivocally that Ashkenazi Jews share the highest level of genetic diversity among European Jews."

So how can the Ashkenazi's origin story be right? It may be a question of geography. According to the genetic profile, the Jewish population originated in
