 but a variant design is available for Marvel's upcoming Fantastic Four crossover comics.

Marvel's Spider-Woman

The first image above clearly shows a spider-woman fighting with her new hero in a post-apocalyptic world. It's one thing to make a super-powered spider-woman or super-powered character into a super-human, but to take that as a side to make them super-powered as well? These three pieces of design were inspired heavily by the Marvel Spider-Man series which first launched with Spider-Woman's first appearance in Fantastic Four 2.

We first saw both the Spider-Woman Spider-Man as a kid and Spider-Man as he grew up, but she's also been a little more developed in her powers since then as she gets older and he's a superhero with a stronger ego. To put that into perspective, we've only seen some of these four pieces of inspiration in comics.

When we first saw Spider-Woman in Marvel Comics, she was a blonde woman with short black hair which would have been one of those things that would normally be seen in a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles character. But as the reader became older and became more capable of doing most superhuman feats, the costume changed and she became an evil person as she entered adulthood. The character's overall design is also a little different though as it's a completely different costume for her.

And that's without saying that Marvel decided not to add a "Marvel Spider-Woman" to the title,
