 in formation, the American electorate has tended to split its votes relatively evenly between the two. This has led to the two major parties having firm control over any and all political progress. In order for a third-party to gain meaningful traction, they must be able to actively court media outlets, larger donors, and draw support from relevant communities. Furthermore, they must be able to get their message out and gain recognition from the American populace. This is often difficult in the United States, so many politicians find that running as a representative for a two-party system is easier, and more likely to lead to electoral success.
