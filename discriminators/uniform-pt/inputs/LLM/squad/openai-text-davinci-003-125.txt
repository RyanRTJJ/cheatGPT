The campaign was Napoleon's first major campaign in Italy, which was aimed at increasing French control over the region. Napoleon's advance guard crossed the Alps by the Saint-Gothard Pass, while the main army marched northwards through the Simplon Pass. After crossing the passes, Napoleon first attacked the cities of Milan and Turin and then divided his forces into two armies. One marched south under the leadership of General Jean Victor Moreau, while the other, under General Louis Desaix, marched north towards the Po River.

Napoleon then took direct command of the southern army, and at the Battle of Marengo, his forces decisively defeated the Austrian forces of General Melas. This victory gave Napoleon a strong foothold in Italy, as it provided him with control of a strategic high ground, as well as boasting a strong navy. Napoleon was then able to march north and reach Milan before the Austrians could regroup. He won several other battles before eventually entering Rome as a conqueror in October 1800.

The campaign was a significant success for Napoleon, as it resulted in the consolidation of French control over the region. He kept the territory until the end of 1800 and then ceded it to Austria per a peace treaty.
