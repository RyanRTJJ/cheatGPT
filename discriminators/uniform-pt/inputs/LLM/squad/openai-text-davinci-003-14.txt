 article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of "les États Généraux", as a phrase applied to the British Parliament.

Generally speaking, during the Enlightenment period, the term "États Généraux" was an ideological term, referring to the idea of a unified government representing the interests of the people. This was in contrast to the ancien régime, which was seen as oppressive and out of touch. This was the way the term was used in the famous "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen" that was adopted by the National Assembly in 1789. The declaration stated that the people's sovereignty should be expressed "either by the assemby of the people, or of the representatives of the people assembled in the États Généraux". This was a clear call for a unified government that represented the interests of the people. 

In modern French usage, the term is still primarily an ideological one, referring to a form of government based on the representation of the people. This can mean anything from representative democracy to parliamentary systems to even direct democracy.
