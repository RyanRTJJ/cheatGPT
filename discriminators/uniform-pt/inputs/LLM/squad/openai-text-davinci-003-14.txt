onal institution for the study of religious sciences, such as the interpretation of shruti, hadith, and fiqh. The Ottoman madaris also acted as a source of social and religious guidance, as well as a center of moral education, providing advice to the ruling community and sultans while regularly interacting with them. The education imparted at the madaris typically included recitation of Islamic legal texts and deep jurisprudential thought, teaching the fundamentals of Quranic sciences, reading various commentaries, lectures, and debates. The teachers at the madaris were usually highly-educated ulema, who were considered to be among the most knowledgeable scholars of their time. 

The decline of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, however, started to take its toll on the madaris, as the curriculum and practices of the madaris began to decline and become increasingly obsolete. The reforms of the Tanzimat period also had a strong impact on the madaris, as the government began to place more focus on modern education, and the power of the madaris and the ulema began to diminish as a result. This process was furthered in the 20th century, as the use of the Turkish language in religious instruction began to be more widely used than Arabic.
