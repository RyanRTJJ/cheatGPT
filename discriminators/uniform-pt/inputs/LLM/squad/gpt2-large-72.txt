αί) were synonymous words, as the latter was probably the ancient Eleans word for the South-Germanic name of the Greeks Aesculapius. The Greeks are supposed to have destroyed the temple of Danaos, on Mt. Aiolos, from the spring of Aiolus. However, this, so far as remains of it are concerned, was only an instance of barbarous over-exportation of Greek names.

The Cimmerians were the name given to the Germans by Homer, i. 1, 553. The Etruscans called themselves Cimmerians. The Cimmerians were once called Germans by Homer; it is an over-exportation, which they call the Aiolia, because of the famous Aiolian spring of Aiolus. The Etruscans were once called Romans; it is an over-exportation which brings them into conflict (see Orestes): Aiolus was the name of their capital, where they were besieged by the Romans near the year 382.

Makes them like the Britons. As a matter of fact, if the Etruscans and Britons really were one people, and were the same with the English and Welsh, the name of Great Britain must also have come from them; for that is what the Etruscan word Bactrinos (meaning 'bamboo' or 'barnacle') is still called in Greek. However, what the Etruscans call the 'bamboo' in the modern sense is not the only thing which gave rise to the name: the fact that the Germans think, not in accordance with the Homeric and Virgilic tradition, that they are an island is of great consequence for us. By this reason some modern scholars have already asserted that the Bactrians were not barbarians, in the tradition of the Greeks. The Aiolian spring of Aiolus is now known as the Cimmerian spring (which, as I have seen, is probably the
