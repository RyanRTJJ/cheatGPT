 First Temple, the Jews were confined to what is now Palestine but had a prominent presence in the Mediterranean, the Near and Middle East and, for a shorter time and under more oppressive circumstances, in the Near East. The Second Jerusalem Period was the period of the Babylonian Empire (c. 539 â€“ 525 BCE) and it witnessed the final triumph of Israel over the Persians and the subsequent disappearance of the Jews from the historical stage.

"In Babylonian captivity," wrote Israelite scholar David Keren in his book, "The Jewish Experience, there were three things that separated Jews from all other peoples and nations. Jews were to be recognized as a distinct group of people, as an integral part of the Persian and Hellenistic culture, and in its cultural and political expression. They were to be ruled separately from other citizens, and thus became free at all times from both the political and religious oppression of the Babylonians." [3]

It is the second of the three conditions (apart from the first being the absence of oppression) that is of interest to us today. It is noteworthy today that while the Babylonian captivity was in full swing, the Jewish people had a strong belief in God, in the Torah, and in a world-wide redemption.

The third condition has not fared well for the Palestinians in their own history either, especially when they came into conflict with Israel. Many today fail to understand that the Arab-Israeli conflict has been defined by what may be called 'political independence'.
