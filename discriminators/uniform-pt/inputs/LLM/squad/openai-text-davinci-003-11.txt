 and can and do require a people to be concerned for each other, for the greater whole of which each person is a part.

Hegel does this by developing the idea of Kantian ethical communities as specific, concrete modes of life or 'ethical textures.' These communities enable humanity to live a life of purpose, aims, and ideals built on an idea of ethical obligation or duty, where individuals have an 'ethical self-consciousness' that binds them together in relation to each other, and to the whole. 

In practicality, this understanding of ethical obligation entails meaningful cooperation for mutual benefit, and recognizing that each individual is an integral part of the whole, rather than the sole creator and rational source of values. This allows a dynamic dialogue to be had around the mutually accepted standards and shared ethical ideals, rather than rigid adherence to abstract and absolutist rules. 

Hegel's view thus allows humans to move beyond the narrow focus of their self-interest and embrace a more universal, communal and ethical form of living. As such, Hegel's notion of an ethical community can still inform modern ethical reasoning and offer insight into how we can build communities informed by principles of cooperation, mutual respect, and shared understanding.
