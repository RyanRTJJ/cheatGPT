 with about 70 of them still in operation as of 2002. Around that time the system of secondary railways was completed to connect the centres in towns and villages.

In the late 1930s a third line to Heilbronn was built, which was followed by rail links to Bormannstadt and Gera. The last link to the city was opened in May 1945, with further connecting lines being built to Halberstadt and Gera to allow connections with the rail system at Bormannstadt.
