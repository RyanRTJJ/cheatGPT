 Islands, "and in case you don't expect a letter to you I have been so unlucky as not to send you one for the last fifteen days".

Darwin read the letter and was excited, because in it Wallace had suggested "the possibility of a new organic being, or forms of life, having some special relation to each other, which I find a difficulty with which the term species does not seem to account" (the "relationship").

At that time, the Maluku Archipelago was a known archipelago and as such the centre of biodiversity, but at the time Darwin did not know these islands were part of the Wallacea islands. Therefore, in his first letter to Wallace on the letter on 25 June 1858 he states: "I am more amazed than I can well express myself, that the idea of the Malakula forms being intermediate should have occurred to you." But then Darwin realised that perhaps they really are.

In September Charles Darwin had already read Wallace's paper on the new taxon-form, but he still needed a bit more information, for the taxonomic implications. He therefore wrote: "A new animal would not be easy to rank as an intermediate form between two others".

In the next (October 1858) letter, he writes to Wallace:

If my guess is right these islands are a portion of the New World, and the existence of intermediate gradations of form in New Caledonia would be strong corroborative evidence
