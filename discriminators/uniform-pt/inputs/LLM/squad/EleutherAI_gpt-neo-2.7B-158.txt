 and current player Aaron Craft are the only senior starters on that roster. The other players on the roster are sophomores in Cameron Wright and Jaxson Turner. The team has won four Atlantic Sun titles in the past eight years, and a few years ago, lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament for the first time in 21 years. That was the last first-round exit for the school since 1992. That could be the first-ever loss in program's history.

Coach Steve Shields was hired in February of 2009. Shields is joined at Marshall by a group of former players, some have been with the program since 2000, others have been there for three-plus seasons. The team is led by assistant coach Chris Duhon. Duhon also coached at Marshallâ€™s sister school UAB and was an assistant coach under Shields when that team won the 2010 National Invitation Tournament. Duhon brings back an extensive background at both the high school and college level. He played at Marshall where he helped lead the team to back-to-back A-Sun championships in 2004-05 and 2005-06. He was a 2006-07 All-A-Sun player, and had a career-high 23 points as a sophomore in the NCAA tournament loss to Florida State in 2004. He also played for the Chicago Bulls (2006-07) where he was on the NBA Summer League team, and scored a career high of 17 points in the game against the Heat. He is an assistant coach at the University of Miami.

The men were expected to earn a bid to the 2013 post-season tournament. The only team without an NCAA tournament appearance
