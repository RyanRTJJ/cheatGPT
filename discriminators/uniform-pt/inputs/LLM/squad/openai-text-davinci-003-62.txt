 transition from the 68000 processors to the PowerPC. The emulator enables software written for the earlier chips to run on the latest Macs. 

The architecture of Intel's x86-64 processors are very similar to their x86 predecessors, allowing Intel and Macintosh to use the same instruction set. The Rosetta translation layer provides a mapping of the existing PowerPC instructions to the x86-64 instruction set. This enables those applications written for the earlier chip to still run on the latest Macs but with the potential of reduced performance compared to when running natively on the PowerPC instructions.

Apple has worked hard to ensure that the majority of users do not feel the impact of the transition to Intel x86-64 processors. Much of the same software and hardware that ran on the earlier Macs will still run on the current lineup. In many cases, developers have adjusted their products to run natively on the x86-64 architecture and have improved overall performance of their software. 

Since Intel chips have become the processors of choice for Macs, Apple has taken several steps to continue improving the user experience and keep the platform competitive. Silicon innovations such as multithreading, multiple cores, and Hyper-Threading allow great performance gains and provide distinct advantages over older PowerPC chips. These advancements help Apple remain competitive in the hardware and software markets.
