 39–38 BC, although this is controversial.

The Eclogues is a collection of ten pastoral poems composed by Virgil sometime between 42 and 39 BC. It is widely believed that the collection was published between 39–38 BC, though this remains controversial. Through a series of reflections on rural life, Virgil celebrates the harmony of love and earth, though also speaks to a new wave of literary exploration. He uses the idealized landscapes of rural Italy to invoke themes of social change, religious longing, and the power of fate. The vibrant garden imagery evokes the inspiration of pastoral classical poetry and anchoring the reader to an ancient world of bucolic myth.
