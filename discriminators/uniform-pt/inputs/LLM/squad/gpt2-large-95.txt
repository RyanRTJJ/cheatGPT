 folk-rock band The Hives. While mandolins could make a great second-stringer at times, the sound was too shrill, and it made the music too melodramatic to work well.

The main problem with the banjo is its size, which makes it bulky compared to other musical instruments, and makes it hard to play softly if you are strumming it. But the guitar is not the only instrument with this problem—people often try to play the ukulele against the banjo because of its size. On the other hand, the guitar is well-suited for playing ukulele-related melodies (just put a ukulele in a room with a bassist, and it will still sing—even as a second-stringed mandolin). Many people who have not learned to play the guitar because its dimensions are too big have tried to play like their first ukulele by bending their upper body slightly to the right or left, and sometimes strumming their guitar. The results usually are less exciting than with a mandolin, especially with fast chords, but the result is often satisfying.

Another major problem has to do with the acoustic tuners. Many modern electric guitars use the same tuning machines as their acoustic cousins. When playing through a new model, the tuners must be kept in tune (or corrected) by adjusting screws in the tuner. This can be an expensive hassle. Some people think that a banjo tuner, instead of screws, should be used for the ukulele tuning, but that is impractical.
