The cephalic, gastric, and rectal movements take place at the same time. The rectal movement takes place in the bowels, not the abdomen. The colon makes a wide circular opening and then the bile duct passes through. Bile leaves the blood stream by the bile esophagus and a duct leaves the lungs, bile ducts through the esophagus.

During the period when the cephalic movement is making, the stomach empties, empties, empties. The colon empties, empties, empties. The whole digestion process takes place at the same time.

The body breaks down carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and substances in the stomach and intestines by an enzymatic process called gastric-lymphatic digestion. The digestion is a two-step process, each step with a specific goal.

The first step occurs in the stomach. The first step is directed toward digestion of food. This is called the cephalic phase. After all the foods are digested by the stomach, the second step is directed toward digestion of liquids. This is called the gastric phase.
