 reforms of the 19th century that encouraged more practical teaching, the Yale Report rejected change and argued that the traditional classical curriculum should be the primary focus of a college education. It further suggested that if modern sciences and mathematics had to be taught, they should be taught within the framework of the traditional classical curriculum. The Report made the case that Latin and Greek would teach students essential mental skills, like memory and judgment, which would be useful for any number of life pursuits. 

The Report was significant in preserving the traditional idea of education for the elite class. It also provided support for educators and administrators of the time who had a traditionalist orientation. However, the Yale Report lacked flexibility and failed to take into account the changing educational environment of the time as well as the need to offer a more well-rounded education to students. This would be addressed in the coming decades through a renewed emphasis on more diverse course offerings, such as those of the German universities. As the Industrial Revolution propelled changes to other aspects of life in the 19th century, so too did it impact educational reform.
