, German submarine forces could more easily close in, torpedoing shipping. A blitzkrieg, as a phrase, was first used by one of the German Navy's commanders from 1 June 1943 to refer to this scenario. Allied shipping would also be on a low visibility alert for several months, to avoid getting caught out.

In October 1942, Luftwaffe attacks on the Mediterranean caused about 500,000 deaths in nine months. For comparison, during the entire invasion of the Soviet Union, the Luftwaffe's air campaign claimed one million deaths.

In November 1942, on the island of Sicily, the Luftwaffe staged the Luftwaffe's first air campaign to use the strategic bombing of airfields in the country. Although there were also German seaplanes there—known as "Jugendwagens"—no bombing raids on the islands were ordered by Hitler that day. He gave the order on 8 and 12 November, and on these two days, German planes bombed only Sicily. For comparison, during World War I, air raids on the Mediterranean island of Corsica killed 18,000 people and the Italian city of Naples was bombed and largely destroyed by Allied bombers during the Luftwaffe campaign to conquer the island.

With German air supremacy over Sicily, the Luftwaffe could use the area for training missions but not to conduct an invasion or strike a coastal city. The Luftwaffe conducted training missions with bombing raids, but these were very rare compared to the massive bombing campaign in Europe that followed. As air superiority on the continent was lost during the winter of 1942–1943, the
