 an entry-level model would be available, along with a Blu-ray player. This is the third revision of the system which has been in production since 2006 (PS3 Slim in Japan, PS3 Mini in Europe and PS3 Slim in North America).

In North America an entry-level model with a lower price was announced on November 17, 2012, and came with a cheaper hard-disk capacity, along with an ethernet jack not included in the more expensive models. The price was also reduced from $199 to $169.[1] The PS3 Slim CECH-4000 was released in Asia on December 10-11, 2012, with the PS3 Slim BECH-3000 in Europe, on November 9, 2012. The BECH-3000 was released in Japan on May 24, 2013, with a price cut[2] from 6,980 yen (¥55) to ¥53,760, following the PS3 Slim announcement.

The model was initially available only in Japan. From November to December 2012, a price reduction was announced for European and North American customers, and the "Slim" model, with a lower hard-disk capacity, was made available in these markets.[3] In North America, prices for a 500 GB hard disk were $69 (a $100 savings relative to the previously available 1 terabyte models). The model, with a hard drive capacity of 500 GB, was listed for $249 in Japan, with a 1 terabyte model listed for ¥38,000. As was mentioned in the previous announcement, the HDD capacity for the European model was also reduced from 1 terabyte to 500 GB.[3]

In terms of capacity at the time, the 500 GB hard drive is roughly the same size as the 500 GB drive found in the previous model. Sony also reduced hard disk capacity for the 500 GB model from 1 TB to 500 GB due to storage efficiency.

The slim PS3 is slightly lighter than the previous design, and is an upgrade to the previous model through the use of a smaller form factor and a revised DualShock 3. New features include
