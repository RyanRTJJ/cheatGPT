 According to the authors, "The most effective sleep therapy will be one which is as effective as that required to overcome sleep deprivation during wakefulness." But how effective one has to be for it to be of any use. Studies indicate that long periods of sleep deprivation can make a person less able to remember.

In other words, some people can remember even if they get a lot less sleep than they actually need. And while it may seem logical, it actually may not be a good idea to get a lot of sleep when trying to recall a long-ago event, like the time when someone threw the football for you.

Researchers say if you want to reduce forgetting, you might need an increase in your sleep frequency. So try to get a good night's sleep each night, then spend the next few hours in the zone where you feel refreshed. If you can, add something like exercise to your routine.
