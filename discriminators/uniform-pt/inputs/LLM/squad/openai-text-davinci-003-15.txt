 & effects of bad measures at home & abroad, & in his correspondence brought those consequences finely, & often feelingly, within view," illustrating the admiration and respect both sides held for Burke.

Burke championed conservatism and was a critic of the views of Thomas Paine. Burke is known for his book Reflections on the Revolution in France, in which he argued that the revolution was going down an irresponsible and dangerous path that would result in chaos. He was an advocate for constitutional monarchy, arguing that it was the only form of government that would ensure stability and justice for all. Burke also was a proponent of the British parliamentary system, asserting that only parliament could act as a check on the power of the monarch. He opposed slavery, proposed judicial reforms and reforms to taxation, and defended the importance of tradition and culture. He argued that the government should take greater care to protect religious liberty, property, and personal rights of its citizens. He also famously warned against the culture of "mob rule" emerging from the French Revolution and argued in favor of moderation and temperance in all aspects of life. Burke's works have been seen as both liberal and conservative, depending on the values and beliefs of the reader.
