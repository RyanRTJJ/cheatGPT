ition governments are arrangements where different parties agree to cooperate and form a governing partnership on certain terms and conditions. These include sharing policy decisions, access to ministries and other benefits such as funding for campaigns and special interests.

Coalitions can be formed for a number of reasons, including to introduce foreign policy initiatives, to create an atmosphere of cooperation, to increase the likelihood of success in upcoming elections, and to ensure that minority voices are heard. They typically require extensive negotiations and compromise by all participating parties and can often result in complicated diplomatic relationships between the parties. Additionally, the stability of the government formed by the coalition is often dependent on the conditions of the agreement and can be threatened if one of the parties pulls out or fails to deliver on its commitments.
