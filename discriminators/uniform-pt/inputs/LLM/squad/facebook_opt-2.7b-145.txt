 infected tissue is inoculated into the growth medium and allowed to incubate. An indicator is used to monitor the culture. It is known to employ such methods to detect the presence of bacterial and viral proteins in micro-organismal preparations that have been recovered from various human body fluids.
Microbially mediated biowarfare, including, for example, the production and spread of pathogen particles, is emerging as a concern across the world.
The use of antimicrobial drugs in micro-organisms is a widely used mode of treatment and prevention in order to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. The use of large concentrations of drugs, however, has been linked to a host of health concerns, including toxicity, side effects and carcinogenicity. Furthermore, the health risks in many instances are exacerbated when an antimicrobial drug is employed to combat a resistant micro-organism. Finally, the use of antibacterial drugs generally has undesirable side effects, including damage to the gastrointestinal tract, kidney function, bone marrow suppression, central nervous system depression, skin irritation, and sexual dysfunction. Furthermore, large doses of an antimicrobial drug are required in order to achieve a cure.
The development of effective, environmentally safer, and highly selective antimicrobial agents has also been a longstanding problem in medicine.
