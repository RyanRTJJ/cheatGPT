It was a similar experience in Germany, though not as severe as in the southern states, because Germany's universities had been gradually transformed since its foundation as early as 1903 by an initiative of the National Council for Education. As long as this system maintained its popularity, Germany would be the most promising country in Europe for education and training. The students of north–south universities would be able to take advantage of this trend towards modern research, but their schools would remain rooted in the classical traditions of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

In 1874 the university culture had changed as dramatically in France as in Germany.
