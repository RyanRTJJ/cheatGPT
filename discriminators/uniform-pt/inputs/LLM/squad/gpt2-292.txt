 Maratha king, Abdul Malik, established the Khimla province under the command of the Maharaja of the Khersi (a Persian king, his son and heir in the empire).

During this time Muhammad Shafiq (aka Sadiq Shafiq) became the first Muslim Arab king of Persia, and ruled Persia for seven generations. He founded the first monastic city of Sadiq, which was built in 1770 under the name of Maratha Monastery (the name had become customary in the early 19th century due to the "mulah of Muslims, as if Mecca had become the capital of the people of Arabia"). In 1807, he entered the Kingdom of Sind, which at the time was ruled by the Maharaja of the Khersi dynasty.

When Mohammad Shafiq ascended his throne at a small ceremony, the Khimla province collapsed and Muhammad became Shah of Persia. The Khimla province was declared the capital of the Abbasid, the Muslim conquerors and conquerors of the Islamic Empire. Before long, he became an important figure in Islam, a powerful Muslim ruler with vast influence by virtue of his religion.

After his death, the Muslims seized a major part of Syria and Iraq. They took over the entire Middle East and even conquered the Levant and the Balkans and became a significant part of Middle Eastern culture.

The next year after Islam's founding, it fell apart and Islamic influence started to dwindle. The only true Muslim dynasty of Islam, Islam, was founded by Ibn Abd Salam (later the great-grand-father of Ibn al-QawƒÅri)
