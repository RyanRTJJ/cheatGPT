 as uric acid in the urine. In vertebrates, however, urea is a key component of ammonia produced by bacteria that live on the surface of bodies of water near bodies of water that are saturated with ammonia. In this study, researchers compared the levels of ammonia in a pool with varying levels of fish in it to the levels of ammonia in the pool with the fish removed. When the researchers compared these levels to the levels of ammonia in the pool, they got an interesting result: There's a big difference between the levels of ammonia in the pool with the fish removed and the levels of ammonia in the pool with minimal fish in it. After accounting for the size of the pool and the time interval over which the fish were present, there were some changes in the concentration of nitrogenous waste that happened only after the fish were in the pool. In other words, the pool with the least amount of fish in it had the smallest level of nitrogenous waste. The researchers conclude that this increase of nitrogenous waste came about when fish are removed from the pool.

Of course, it took three years, but the researchers got this answer.

So, What?

It's a pretty neat result. But there's a more interesting question that needs to be addressed: Why did they find this? This isn't even the only study that has addressed this question. Many of
