 suggested the university as a Western phenomenon which had strong effects across the continent at the dawn of the fifteenth century, and the origins of a distinctive, independent intellectual life of Europe.

The author, in contrast, suggests that the intellectual milieu of Medieval universities may have been shaped considerably by other institutions of late antiquity such as Athens and Rome. These institutions were, in fact, centers of learning in the ancient world and thus had many similarities to the universities of medieval Europe. The author contends that it was not the university alone that played a key role in the development of medieval European culture, but a variety of institutions in the ancient world that formed a common intellectual milieu. The author suggests that there was a common cultural milieu associated with these institutions that provided a unique, distinct and enduring structure for the medieval European university. This theory is supported by a number of recent archaeological findings that have established that ancient Athenian universities were comparable to medieval European universities.

This work, however, poses some of the most challenging issues for medieval scholars and for archaeologists that we face today. The article will address some of these challenges and also attempt to clarify some of the key questions that remain unanswered.
