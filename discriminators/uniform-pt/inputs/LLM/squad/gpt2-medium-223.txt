 Sleep also increases the amplitude of voluntary muscle contractions, which may help to prevent muscle spasms and improve memory. Sleep may diminish the tendency of patients to become "bored" or to lose interest when they go to sleep, as discussed in section 9.1. In this regard, it may be useful to consider that during sleep, it does not make sense to use computer and video games to concentrate the brain into a task-oriented state prior to waking for this reason. It may, however, be useful for treating sleep disturbances by reducing the influence of stimulants, stress hormones, alcohol or stimulant drugs, or by reducing exposure to noise. For example, the effects of nicotine on memory and attention may be increased; such studies are required to evaluate the behavioral efficacy of a mild form of nicotine therapy.

Other conditions that may contribute to amnesia during sleep include sedation or anesthesia during wakefulness or sleep, drugs that interfere with sleep such as insomnia drugs such as paracetamol, caffeine, cocaine, and amphetamines, and medications that impair the attention process in some way. The presence of psychostimulants (e.g., lithium, valproate, or haloperidol) during REM sleep may influence the development of memory and awareness during sleep. Thus, it may be helpful to consider that some of these conditions could interfere with the development of memory and attention. In addition, drugs of abuse, such as alcohol or stimulants, that appear to affect certain aspects of attention during sleep may increase risk of developing posthypnotic responses to questions in memory. The interaction between these symptoms, including confusion,
