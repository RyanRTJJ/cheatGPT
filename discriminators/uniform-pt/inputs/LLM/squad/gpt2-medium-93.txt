 as to whether the Ashkenazi share any genetic differences from non-Ashkenazi Jewish populations. However, since then, further research on Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA has revealed differences among Ashkenazi Jews in certain types of genes, the most notable of which is Dna. Dna was originally identified by Jewish geneticists as an ancient trait that differentiated Ashkenazi Jewish individuals from other Ashkenazi Jews living in Europe, mainly Central Europe and southern Italy. Dna also was known to be inversely related to age. By examining mitochondrial DNA of nearly 8,000 people from 26 separate families and living in 23 different towns, the researchers determined that Dna is found in almost all Ashkenazi non-Orthodox Jewry, including Ashkenazi Jews of the Northern European descent and Ashkenazi Jews not of that ancestry. This discovery provides the strongest evidence yet that Ashkenazi Jews are genetically distinct from non-Jewish populations and that Dna may play some role in both genetic and cultural mixing among Jews. Some geneticists also have recently argued this result may also be causal, as when a Jewish or Jewish-derived individual marries a non-Jewish person, it could result in that person's inheriting their Dna.

This evidence suggests that genetic mixing among Ashkenazi Jews—and as well as among various non-Jewish peoples—may begin as early as the time of the original Exodus. This means that both Ashkenazi Jews and non-Jews may share the same genetic history, which makes it easier to study such cultural, language, and ethnic mixing as long as the historical relationship is recognized.

Even though it has become clear that Dna plays prominent
