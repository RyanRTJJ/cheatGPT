 urea or ammonia. Urates, a combination of uric acid and other elements, are then excreted through the bird's cloaca. Uric acid is significantly less toxic than ammonia, allowing birds to live in enclosures with far less ventilation than would be necessary for other animals. This helps to conserve energy, as ventilation requires energy in the form of food. 

Uric acid is also less soluble than other nitrogenous wastes, which also helps to reduce swelling. The development of uric acid excretion has been a crucial adaptation in the evolution of birds, allowing them to fly higher and longer than reptiles or other animals. Uricotelism is thought to have evolved in the first stem-birds of the Mesozoic Era, and has been retained in all the descendants of these primitive flying birds ever since.
