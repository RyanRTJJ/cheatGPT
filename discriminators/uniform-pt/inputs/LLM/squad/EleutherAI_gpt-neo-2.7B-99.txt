 the Basic Set. For the most part, the NES had been out-sold, largely through the NES Classic and NES Mini, which featured mostly remade games. Since they were re-releases of the NES games released for the NES, they were called Classic Sets. They were released in the spring of 2017, when the Classic Set was still on the way, and consisted mostly of NES classics first released in the NES format: the likes of Super Mario Bros. from Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong from Donkey Kong Land, The Legend of Zelda from Ocarina of Time, etc. This set only featured versions up to and including Super Mario Bros. 3, the only game to feature the Nintendo Entertainment System version. In addition, the NES Classic was designed to be compatible with the NES Classic Mini, making its entire library playable. In 2019, it was revealed that the Classic Set would be expanded to include the NES Classic Edition, which would include a number of ports over its predecessors. This was to include ports of the classic games on Nintendo consoles, a port of Super Mario World and Super Mario Kart, the Game Boy Advance version of Excitebike, and the original NES launch title Super Mario Bros., as well as Super Mario Bros., Super Mario World and Donkey Kong.

Nintendo released several different variants of the Classic Set, including ones with different boxes, with the basic, Action, or Control Deck variant
