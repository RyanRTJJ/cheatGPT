’s Witnesses beliefs—congregations will administer what are called “fair trials.” Each trial focuses on the same seven topics:

1) Truth of God’s Revelation (Who are Jehovah’s Witnesses)

2) Truth of the Christian faith (Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Teach the Old Testament?)

3) Truth of Bible Prophecy (Does the Bible Predict the Destruction of Babylon?)

4) Truth of Bible Miracles (Are Jehovah’s Witnesses Truly Miracle-Working?)

5) Truth of Witnesses’ Organization (Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Really Have Their Own Organization?)

6) Truth of Scriptures—The Kingdom of God (Does the Kingdom of God or Armageddon really exist?)

7) Truth of Witnesses’ Organization (Is Jehovah’s Organization Really God’s Organization?)

The accused member is not allowed to discuss the case with anyone else and may not have any contact with any individuals except Jehovah’s Witnesses witnesses until after the conclusion of the trial. Any contact between the accused and the accuser of any kind before the trial can result in the case being dismissed.

As Jehovah’s Witnesses can be “disentangled” from their families under serious charges of apostasy, it can be very difficult to see a loved one’s side of the story. When this goes as badly as it can, many people end up losing their homes, jobs and sometimes their children. It is no wonder that Watchtower’s “Fair Trial” process is not the exception but the rule.

At the core, this is a human rights violation of the highest order. However, Watchtower and Witnesses have been successfully claiming that this is a “religious freedom” defense, where courts need to be very careful about infringing upon the religious freedoms
