 In 1957, the USSR launched its first satellite; in 1958, the Soviets reached the height of its rocket power. Meanwhile, the United States was still planning a human flight. It was a race to get first to space by 1961, which would allow human spacecraft to enter orbits which were longer than a day.

In 1960, Yuri Gagarin became the first person to orbit the earth. In 1961, a year after John Glenn became the first American in space, the Soviet Union captured cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, a cosmonaut on a different rocket, who had become an observer in the rocket cabin, and sent him into orbit. Americans had already been sent nearly that far. By 1965, a manned Apollo lunar mission was in the works. In 1966, America sent a man into space, Buzz Aldrin. In 1969, a man named Yuri Gagarin died when his spacecraft crashed into the Pacific Ocean. During the period when the Soviet Union focused so much on its space program, America's space program suffered. It also suffered because of the American military's space program, which competed with the Soviet Union's space program in the 1960s.

When Mercury, the original capsule from which humans were being sent into space, was destroyed in January 1958, NASA switched to Gemini and the Space Shuttle. From the beginning, people have said that the space shuttle's two-stage orbiter was not meant for the weight of a manned space flight. Instead, the shuttle required a heavier, heavier lifting body to help launch its orbiter to space. The Apollo vehicles did that
