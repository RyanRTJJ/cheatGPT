onso de Alameda made many contributions to the works here, including the stone paving and the bronze gates built in 1500. It was completed in 1500, a year after Alameda died, where also the Archbishop laid. Since then the cathedral suffered alterations, and many times it was restored to its original majesty. It is still considered to be in its original state and its current condition was achieved during the construction of the Catedral San Francisco del Monte de Oaxaca in the 1960s. It has been declared a National Heritage in 1992. This church is believed to be a descendant of the Templo Mayor, built by the Tlacopan king Tepaneca.

The main part of the building, with its unique structure, is the central part with the nave built in the form of an irregular oval, the dome was added in the 15th, which was the period when the structure was completed. The interior has been restored since the 18th century. During the French occupation, there was a revolution in Oaxaca, and the church was attacked by French soldiers who stole a great quantity of artwork.
