 My Life." But a handful of those bands, like AC/DC, still made good money and survived financially. There are many others that had bad luck in songwriting and didn't have the financial security of AC/DC to carry them through, but managed to release solid hit-albums and sell millions of records. Many people wonder how many of these bands will survive a few years down the line, but I'm convinced that some will actually achieve new levels of success.

Successful musicians can learn something of value each time they play their instrument for the first time and use it to improve their playing abilities the next time around.
