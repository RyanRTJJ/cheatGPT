 There is even a Greek translation of the New Testament (Tertullian) that claims that Mary was the most perfect creature there was and yet that she will come to repentance through "natural means, as if by defilement" (V. 20).

Mary was made sinless in the womb of the Virgin (John chapter 1) on account of the fact that God chose her, not "on account of any man's actions, nor on account of what she had done for any one, as was the case with Adam and all the other men who were created at the beginning" (Gen. 2:18-20). What Mary did, God himself did in her womb.

Mary was made sinless "because it pleased the Lord, who loved her very much, to have all His elect to be born of her" (Rom. 3:21). Adam's sin was not one of his own choosing. He was born sinful due to his relationship with his Creator and as a result of the fall. He was born the way he was made (Gen. 3:8).

Mary's sin is not one that she will have to face on her own. In fact, she has already overcome "all sin and death through her passion for the Lord" (Col. 2:12). Her sinlessness is also "a gift from God" (Eph. 2:8).

We are still sin-susceptible, however, and cannot be completely free from sin because we are "children of wrath" (Rom. 5:12) and as such cannot even truly be reconciled to God (1 Cor. 5:18-21).

All this is why we can say with conviction: "It is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not as a result of anything that you have done!" (Eph. 2:8).
