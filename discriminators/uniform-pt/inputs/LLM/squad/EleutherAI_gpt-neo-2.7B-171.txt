Here it first met with the resistance of the Illyrians and later of a Roman expeditionary force, led by Claudius. This latter force, which included the first non-Illyrian general mentioned in the history, Pius the Vespers, met an unexpected obstacle in the form of a small cavalry detachment from a small town in Greece. When Pius' men killed the detachment they were immediately repulsed by the Illyrians. This left Demetrius isolated in Macedonia and without any obvious means of getting back on his way to Rome, thus provoking him to raise a small force for an attack on the Illyrian village. The battle thus began as a sort of local-genocide between a Macedonian village and a Roman army of unknown size. What followed was a large-scale defeat of the Illyrians and a massive defeat which led to the occupation of the entire Illyrian region between the rivers Therma and Mesta (modern day Bulgaria).
