rovide us with genuine insight into the good human life. From this point of view, Hegel sees himself not as rejecting or supplanting Kant and German idealism in general, but rather as developing and perfecting their insights.

In particular, Hegel sees the need to reconcile Kant's distinction between theoretical and practical reason with the concept of a single, unified reason that exists in the form of dialectical logic. To do this, Hegel affirms Kant's distinction between universal law and moral autonomy, but also maintains that the Kantian moral self can only be understood in the context of a larger systematic structure that includes both theoretical and practical reason. According to Hegel, this system of rationality must take account of history, pursuing the idea of absolute spirit and the progressive development of human freedom. Thus, Hegelâ€™s project in part is to bring Kantian and German idealism into a unified, systematic whole that makes sense of history as the development of our capacity for freedom and ethical self-realization.
