The Celtic kingdom of Gallaecia, home to the northern castros, was eventually absorbed by the Roman Republic and made a province of the Roman Empire. The Romans created the new principality of Tarraconensis derived from Gallaecia which included the area of modern Galicia.

In the late 5th century, Germanic tribes invaded the Iberian Peninsula and, after conquering the Suebi and Vandals, occupied Galicia and the northern regions of the Peninsula. In the 6th century, the Visigoths, one of the Germanic tribes, ended the Roman Empire's control of the peninsula. 

In the early 8th century, the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate began to persecute Christians and expand its territory in the Iberian Peninsula, taking control of almost the entire Peninsula. During this time, the Suebi and Visigoths established the kingdom of Asturias, which later expanded to encompass most of modern Galicia. The Asturian king Pelayo captured the city of Compostela and the Islamic conquest of the region ended in the 8th century. In the 9th century, the independent kingdom of Galicia was founded.
