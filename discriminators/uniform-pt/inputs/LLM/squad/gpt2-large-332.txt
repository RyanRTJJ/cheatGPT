, now part of Mexico. However, on 18 November of that year, the Mexican army entered the city of Chihuahua, at the head of twenty divisions, and seized its capital and all of its territories in the province of Veracruz in the south. This success was in no short term related to the military prowess of the Mexican army; the actual fighting was conducted with such a degree of brutality that it was said to be the first victory by such forces since the Battle of Ternate in 1808. Although Mexican authorities never named the military leaders responsible for the battle that ensued, the general who led the army into the battle was the notorious Lieutenant General Manuel Ruiz de Escalante, nicknamed El Toro. Although the Spanish defeat did not result in the immediate defeat of the Mexican army, it did leave the American side with a sense of insecurity and made American officials begin to speculate as to the possible means by which Mexican forces could be defeated in Chihuahua. In addition to General Escalante, there appeared to be two other officers, Lieutenant General Antonio Hernandez Caro (who was described at the time as being of noble heritage) and Lieutenant General Antonio de Aguilar, both of whom managed to escape into the desert. Lieutenant General Cuauhtémoc Álvarez, in his capacity as commander of the Mexican forces in the city of Ciudad Juárez in Chihuahua, organized and directed the campaign of 1845 and took command of the army in the ensuing battle. Cuauhtémoc Álvarez himself was killed in the battle as well as his younger brother Juan.

After the Mexican campaign in Chihuahua, General Ruiz de Escalante again took the lead in the campaign that the Mexican commander had planned after the success of his battles in Mexico. There had been a strong military sentiment to continue with this campaign, and a letter written by General Escalante to Secretary of War Stephen Mather, dated 3 November 1845, indicates that he believed an invasion of Mexico should begin with an attack on Chihuahua. "I will order the Mexican army to begin an attack on Chihuahua. Our objective is Chihuahua, the capital of Chihuahua," he wrote.
