 Sun's former general editor, David Dinsmore. Dinsmore, now editor of the Spectator magazine, said last evening: "That report was completely discredited, completely untrue. It was never commissioned by The Sun." He said the case was not about the "politically correct" approach in the media, but about "trying to get this important public official to apologise for something he did not do".

The prosecution accused the journalists and others of conspiring to defame the late judge, the Crown Prosecution Service, the police and the BBC. Dinsmore, who was the chief legal correspondent at the Sun for most of the time around the trial, denied any wrongdoing.

"There were no criminal charges made against me at the time of the story I was sent," he said. "Even though I had no authority, we were following established journalistic rules in a case in which the press was making threats against Jeremy Corbyn in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster." There was "no cover-up," he said. The alleged misconduct, he said, was "obvious and undeniable", and he had refused to be drawn into giving them the benefit of the doubt.

After a nine-day trial which lasted for four days, the jury found Dinsmore guilty of the two charges, of criminal conspiracy, and four of misconduct in a public office.

The Crown Prosecution Service said today it found no criminality. It said the journalist's actions was completely appropriate in circumstances of widespread public concern and did not warrant prosecution. But the spokesman said it had been difficult to prove in this case that there had been a cover-up. It was not "about what kind of press behaviour a journalist can or should practice", said the spokesman.
