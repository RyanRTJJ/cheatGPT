enelle's Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds. Published in 1686 and written in French, the work used a dialogue format to explore scientific theories and the universe. 

The Dialogue between the Two Ancients and the Two Moderns, one of the first works to be published by the enlightenment philosopher Voltaire in 1752, is considered a predecessor to the same sort of goal. While it was written largely for academics, it nevertheless discussed many scientific topics among the everyday commoners. 

In the 19th century, the development of the printing press and subsequent increase in the production and readership of books would continue to facilitate the spread of scientific knowledge to the masses. In the late 19th century, popular scientific books such as The Plurality of Worlds by Camille Flammarion, Outlines of Astronomy by John Herschel, and The Popular Science Monthly by Edward L. Youmans opened up scientific topics to the public in a way which was unprecedented. 

As the 20th century progressed, books such as Richard Feynman's QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter (1984) and Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time (1988) tackled highly complex scientific theories and brought them to the attention of the masses in a readable and entertaining manner. This established a trend for works of popular science that continues to this day.
