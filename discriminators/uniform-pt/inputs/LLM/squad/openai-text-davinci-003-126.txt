 of Ternate in the Malay Archipelago. Inside was a manuscript in which Wallace provided a detailed description of the same basic principles on Natural Selection. It was clear to Darwin that Wallace was quite ahead in the field.

This event stands as one of the great turning points in Darwin's life and the history of science. Unwilling to stand in the shadow of Wallace, Darwin quickly published his own book on Natural Selection in November 1859, now known as "On the Origin of Species." It was the definitive work on evolution, describing the process and outlining its implications for the wider sciences. Darwin and Wallace would go on to become famous for their achievement, and their work stands as some of the most important contributions made to the biological sciences.
