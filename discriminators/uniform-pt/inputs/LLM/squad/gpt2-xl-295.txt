 June 16, 1961, American Tim Kopra became the first American to ride aboard the Atlas-Agena.

Gagarin had to be forced out of his crew seat, put in a jail cell, and put in quarantine when he returned to his home country. During the Apollo 8 mission, cosmonaut Alan Shepard would perform the first American orbital docking. Shepard also would fly
