 of The Origin of Species to all of his publishers, but the publisher's publishers and agents eventually sued to get their share of the profits. The first publication of Darwin's book in the United States, in Boston in 1859, was sold in limited editions with no book sales price. Since this was the first published book in the United States, Darwin's book was widely seen as a national landmark in American history.

When The Origin of Species was published in 1859, it is estimated that about 30,000 copies were printed. Most of the copies were in Europe and Russia. These copies ran up to 70 to 120 euros (depending upon the price of the paper), and they are rare today. Unfortunately Darwin did not do a fair job of keeping track of how expensive The Origin of Species had become in the West. In an 1867 letter he states: "If, as a man, I have ever been so foolish as to allow my own writings to cost my family means to purchase, yet I am so much the more foolish in the belief that they ought to have been, when I see the cost of so many editions of The Origin of Species going like sand in the hourglass of my family and my friends."

It is difficult to judge how many copies of The Origin of Species were made in England, since the book was written in Latin, not English. Nevertheless, Darwin estimated that about a million copies were imported into England and the United States and sold.

A good idea is to read The Origin of Species before you read The Life of Charles Darwin.
