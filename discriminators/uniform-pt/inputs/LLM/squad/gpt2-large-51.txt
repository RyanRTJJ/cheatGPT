 things were going. At least one person who was injected responded as if his symptoms had diminished. He and some colleagues, however, were confused about the cause of the treatment, and this led to the development of a theory in which their reactions were due to the "faulty" epinephrine and not the drug. That theory led to the use of epinephrine by doctors in medicine and public health in the 1970s.

Many studies support the role of the hormone epinephrine in the treatment of anaphylaxis, however.

The evidence is much more convincing in severe and persistent anaphylaxis, such as severe sepsis or severe asthma. About 10% of the general population is anaphylactic and 1% to 2% of these will have a worse reaction to epinephrine alone. Some 40% of patients with severe allergy or asthma have a better response to epinephrine alone.

Many people who have been severely allergic to eggs or peanuts (allergic rhinitis) or to many foods or products that cause allergies are also exposed to epinephrine. About one third of all allergic reactions occur at the site of the vaccination.

Research in the 1970s showed that an epinephrine infusion was sufficient to prevent the death of the person who had been exposed.

A patient who had severe acute flaccid paralysis who also had another reaction to epinephrine before going to the hospital also benefited from an epinephrine infusion before going
