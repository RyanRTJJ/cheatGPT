 agree that self-esteem is the key component to attaining and maintaining identity. Theories have proposed and supported self-esteem theory in many different areas of science, including political/economy, law & society, sociology, psychology, and biology. Self-esteem has been identified as the greatest predictor of future behavior in adolescents and young adults. To date, however, there is little research on the self-esteem of older individuals in order to assess the importance of self-esteem development in older individuals. Self-esteem has been linked with depression, anxiety, body image, and substance abuse in adults.

To assess the potential mediating role between self-esteem and personality, the factor model that was used to explain the findings for college students was applied. The independent variables measured were self-esteem, personality, and gender. There was no significant relationship between self-esteem and personality. However, as predicted, higher self-esteem predicted increased self-relatedness and openness, but not prosociality, to a significant and statistically significant extent. To determine the mediating role of self-esteem in the relationship between a positive personality and higher self-esteem, it was tested whether the factor model to explain the relationship between higher self-esteem and higher personality variables accounted properly for the mediation of the effects of higher self-esteem on personality factors. It was also tested if personality variables mediated the relationship between higher self-esteem and
