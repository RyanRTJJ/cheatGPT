) annually. Although rainfall and frost-free seasons are naturally not always uniform, modern irrigation and cultivation, plus a climate change of increasing temperatures, are increasingly reducing the period of frost risk throughout the year. As a consequence, longer and milder growing seasons have increased the area under cotton, mostly due to changes of climate and production in the northern hemisphere. The global demand for cotton is forecast to be almost 20% above current levels ([@b16-bs-61-347]) and the demand for cotton products is growing at a much faster rate, so that high-yielding cotton varieties are urgently needed. In the current state of affairs, however, the situation in many countries around the world such as China and India is that the development of the cotton industry is lagging far behind its potential. As there is currently no known method for improving the productivity of cotton to a level at which the crop can keep up with the demand, developing high-yielding cotton varieties is, therefore, an unending task.

One approach that has been applied in the past (including to the present generation of cotton varieties) to achieve high yields and good quality is to use a large number of selection criteria in the development of new high-yielding varieties. Selection criterion can be divided into broad (plant appearance, yield and qualitative) and specific (seeds, yield, fibre, boll size, shape, micronaire, length for example). With advances in molecular breeding and molecular genetics (polymerase chain reaction, DNA sequencing and
