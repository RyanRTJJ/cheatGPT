Thus, although the papal bull _Unam Sanctam_ ( _The Sanctity of Mary_ ) explicitly refers to the Immaculate Conception in its decree of 18 June 1453, it is assumed the bull refers only to Mary's Virginity; hence the decree can be understood to imply that in the womb of her mother Mary was conceived without sin.

At the Council of Constance in 1415, the Roman Church promulgated its bull _Dives et Rixa_ ( _Death and Resignation_ ). With this document, the Roman Church reaffirmed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception and condemned the doctrine of Purgatory. The Council reaffirmed _fecunditas_ as the condition by which the Immaculate Conception was to be understood (hence it was accepted at Constance and later by Pius V on 19 February 1644). Despite being an orthodox doctrine, its application to Mary was complicated by popular opinion, which continued to link her with the conception of Jesus.

The Council of the City of Siena of 1648 reaffirmed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception but also condemned the doctrine of Purgatory. The pope, who had been summoned to the Council of the City of Siena by Cardinal-Bishop Girolamo Carpegna, did not attend.
