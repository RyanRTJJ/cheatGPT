In the U.S. and Canada it appears that the HDI is highly likely biased and inaccurate by over- or underestimating the relative health and income shares of older and wealthier men and women.

In both areas, many of the most affluent and educated people spend more of their lives in poverty than the poor.

The under- or overestimation in income in the U.S. affects the HDI as a whole.

And in both countries, the under- or overestimation in poverty affects the HDI more than either average GDP or national income.

The authors describe the error to be more systematic and significant for people with lower levels of education.

The HDI is most likely under-estimated in many regions, but also appears to overestimate in a few regions (Figure C). Areas of excess excess income are mostly in northern and western Canada, in parts of western and central Asia, the Middle East south of the Middle East and the eastern Atlantic, Australia and the Far East.

They warn the HDI could be "misused as a misleading measure of economic inequality."

The authors' conclusions raise the issue of how policymakers can better measure wealth inequality while avoiding "misappropriation of the measure of wealth inequality." They suggest more than one way to define wealth—for example by income or expenditure—but recommend the following:

• "Use national income to define the wealth of households" (see
