out Chicago 5-2 in the eighth inning and moved ahead 2-1 in the bottom of the ninth when Justin Maxwell struck out one.

Evan Martinez gave up two runs and gave up three hits on four hits (one earned) to lead off the inning, while Luis Valbuena added a homer early in the game to start the ninth as the Marlins took a 5-1 lead.

The two-game streak ended with the Cubs advancing to the series finale for the 14th time in 15 tries and the first time all four teams met at a series plate. Chicago won the series 2-1, 6-3.

Chicago is tied for third on the American League, two games back of the Cubs with a game against Colorado coming up on Sunday. The game is 7:30 a.m. CT on NBC.

Game 3 also includes the return of RHP Ryan Nix from a double-header on Sept. 11 to start the series as the third-year big leaguer has faced at least three batters before. Nix faced 10 different batters at bat the previous four years at Marlins Park and the Cubs, as well as at a new ballpark on July 30.

Game 4 will then follow up the two-game series before the team is back in San Francisco Friday night when they face the Dodgers for the third time, 2-2.

In the first matchup of the series, the Cubs will face Houston on Saturday
