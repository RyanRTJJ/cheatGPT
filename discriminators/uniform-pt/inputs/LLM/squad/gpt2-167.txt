. Its inaugural flight was flown by the Challenger Spacecraft. By the mid-1970s, the Soviet Union was the leading contender to take spaceflight to the next level, and the competition quickly degenerated into a war between rival spacefaring nations. As the competition heated up and the two rival nations started to get aggressive, the Soviet Union started using space to attack the United States. The first war between the US and another rival was called the 'SAT-III' campaign in 1984 and ended with a decisive victory over the Soviet Union and its space shuttle. In 1991 an orbital war broke out between rival nations, but with each side's fighters proving capable of taking down multiple rockets at once – not to mention the rocket fire that fueled almost every single mission to date. In 1997 a two-year countdown to the beginning of "space war" broke down as the two rival nations were unable to secure enough supplies to the United States – the Soviets quickly lost ground from rocket fire. The current Cold War has seen the Soviet Union take a number of steps to improve their orbital defense capabilities. One major change is that the Soviet Union has been sending new satellites into space over the past 5-10 years. During the early 2000s, the Soviet space shuttle, which had been slated to come into service only once, became the
