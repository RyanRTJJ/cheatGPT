 Those teams included UC Davis, Boise State, Oregon State, Texas Tech, Utah State, Wyoming, Utah, Washington State, Washington and Utah State. The remaining eight were all in the Pac–12 Conference.


From 1999 to 2011, BYU averaged 26 wins per season. Since moving to the Pac-12 in 2011, the Cougars have won three conference championships: the 2011 Pac–12 Conference regular season title, a 2014 Pac–12 Conference title and the 2015 Pac-12 Conference championship. BYU will defend its 2015 Pac-12 Conference title in the Pac-12 championship game.


One statistic to point out is BYU's success in the NCAA Tournament. BYU has won more NCAA Tournament games than its last three opponents.


Benderson and his staffs will certainly expect a lot from this team. But while the Cougars will certainly have some fun on offense, which has been the main focus for most of the season, the defense could cause BYU problems more than once.

"We've done a good job all season in limiting opponents' 3-point attempts. All of the sudden, when we have the ball in their hands, there's not an easy answer."

He averaged 13 points against
