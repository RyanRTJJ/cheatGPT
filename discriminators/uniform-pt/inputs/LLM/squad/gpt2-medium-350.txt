ius was still at Jerusalem. This was around AD 54. It seems likely that he is referred to in a letter dated 2nd July AD 50 (or about the same time in his life). This relates to a discussion between Hosius and certain followers of the late King Maximus in Constantinople of 4th February, AD 52 (which has been given some credit by Pliny for this). This was probably after Maximus had been murdered. The author is apparently referring to King Maximus by the title "Thayer of the East". The earliest evidence to be placed on this letter dates from AD 41 (or shortly thereafter) according to Pliny and mentions John the Baptist and his journey with Simon the Zealot. The letter itself also does not name Maximus by name and the author does not say a single word of his name either. Instead he mentions the names of some others: the apostles of Christ (as the author of the letter mentions John); the "Pious" (another name he mentions in the letter); and the "Severius", as he mentions the name of "Paul" in the letter. John the Baptist would seem a pretty good example. In fact this would seem to agree with the above, as Pliny adds some additional information from John and refers to him as the "great evangelist" (not quite the same as missionary). However the connection goes further still... John the evangelist was born under the famous title of Simon Peter. He became Jesus Christ. He was baptised at Bethlehem. A few years after he had been born in Bethlehem and the church was built at Cana (now in Belgium), Simon was expelled from the Catholic church because of "stirring up scandal". At this point he moved to Constantinople where he served as teacher in the temple of the Orthodox Father. The first time I ever came across Paul, I was listening intently to a music-hall band with the accompaniment of a cymbal and saw that I remembered reading that he had been baptised at Caesarea in Crete. I had been so impressed by the fact that a famous Catholic had been baptised under his own name in such a large number that I decided that I wanted to make this one history known to all my friends who were interested in the history of Christianity
