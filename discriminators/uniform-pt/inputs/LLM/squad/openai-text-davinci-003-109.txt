simultaneously, the coils one in each arm of the circuit produced a rotating magnetic field. The first practical rotating field electrical machine was built in 1832 by the British scientist Faraday. This machine, which was known as the Faraday disk, provided the first application of rotating field technology that could be used for practical purposes.

The Faraday disk was an early generator that used a permanent magnet to spin a copper disk that was connected to a coil of wire. As the disk rotated, a current was generated in the wire coil and could be used to power other devices. It was the first device to generate an electric current with a rotating magnetic field and the basis for the modern electric motor.

Arago’s rotations and the Faraday disk led to further advances in electricity, such as the development of the first commercial dynamos, which provided a practical way to generate and transmit electricity. By 1890, alternating current had been developed, leading to further breakthroughs such as the development of electric motors and electric lighting.

Today, Arago’s rotations and Faraday’s disk are still used in the electrical engineering field, and the principles demonstrated in these earlier inventions have led to major developments in the field of electricity.
