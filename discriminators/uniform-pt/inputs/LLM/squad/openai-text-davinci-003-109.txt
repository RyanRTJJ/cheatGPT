 by Henry II, four times by Richard I, and six times by Edward I. He also resorted to measures such as tinkers, which allowed him to demand payments from the clergy and nobles in return for a pardon from debt, as well as new taxes such as tallages, which was a way for the crown to take a portion of the revenues from lands held by the king’s tenants-in-chief. The crown also increased its efforts to raise money through fines and the sale of public offices, and John even threatened to reimpose the hated Saladin Tithe if the clergy refused to pay a tenth of their revenues to the crown.

These measures, while effective in the short-term, were deeply unpopular within John’s kingdom. The Barons of England claimed they were “breaking the agreements [they] had with their king and diminishing the royal rights” and led a revolt against John. Ultimately, John’s actions forced him to sign the Magna Carta in 1215, in which he agreed to accept limits on royal authority, giving way to the development of constitutional monarchy. It also saw the development of more equitable taxation, more transparency in government and greater protections for private property.
