 Cubs had a much different looking lineup, featuring rookies Corey Patterson and Brant Brown, as well as free agent acquisition Tyler Houston and oft-injured slugger Sammy Sosa.

The pitching staff featured upcoming stars Kerry Wood and Julian Tavarez, as well as veteran starters Terry Mulholland, Steve Trachsel, and Kevin Tapani.

The team started slow, posting a 20-30 record in June, but went on to finish the season at 90-73, good for second place in the Central-Division, with the Astros winning the crown.

Sosa led the team in home runs, batting average, and RBI, highlights of a successful offensive attack that saw the team score over 800 runs for the season, the first time since 1983 that had been achieved.

The pitching staff was solid all season, boasting the lowest team ERA (4.12) in the division, and 3 pitchers - Wood, Trachsel, and Tavarez - with ERA's under 4.00. The bullpen was just as impressive, as they posted slightly better than league average numbers in ERA and saves.

The team would go on to make a dramatic NLDS push, sweeping the Atlanta Braves in three games, before ultimately falling to the eventual World Series champions San Diego Padres. 

The 1998 season was an exciting one for Cubs fans, as the team showed what it was capable of by making the playoffs for the first time since 1989. With a promising young pitching staff, a dominant offense, and a great defense, the fan base was optimistic that more postseason appearances were on the way.
