The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China (SPDMC) announced Saturday plans for a city-wide pro-democracy mass protest with a march scheduled for Tuesday.

In their statement, the pro-democracy organization called for an “independent” investigation into the use of excessive force against the protesters in the city, and for a public inquiry into an allegedly rigged vote in the election this February. It also called for “immediate implementation of all necessary measures” to address the concerns of protesters who “are deeply troubled by the alleged police brutality” during the city’s demonstrations. “The current events should serve as a wake-up call for the Government of Hong Kong, and as a means to mobilize the population against the ongoing illegal, authoritarian and undemocratic policies of the Hong Kong government,” the statement read. Pro-establishment and localist groups criticized the statement, stating that the SPDMC has no real power in the city. [Full coverage of the protests here]

Last month, several blackouts over the course of a few days disrupted the internet service in several of the city’s districts. In response, the city’s authorities shut down the internet in areas of the city with the most protests, then resumed the service in most other parts
