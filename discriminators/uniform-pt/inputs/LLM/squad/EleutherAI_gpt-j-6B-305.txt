, especially through the past five decades, as modern biotechnology and molecular biology have evolved [Nijhout et al., 2001]. The most important, and most studied, animals known as ‘exotic ungulates’ and ‘exotic fowls’ are the yak, zebu, water buffalo, cattle, sheep, horse, goat, pig and duck. There are other less well known animals that are of more recent introduction to the farming community (Nijhout et al., 2001), however, and there are probably many species known only locally and in zoos.
One problem with hybridising animal is determining whether a cross was deliberate or accidental with the risk of the resulting hybrid offspring being sterile, or of the fertility of the resulting hybrids being low. There is also a desire to create a new cross which is not available in nature, or an equivalent to existing crosses, and to exploit the characteristics of animals available for cross breeding. However, there are strict limitations on cross breeding two animals where hybrids are unwanted because in many countries such hybrids are not permitted to be traded, or are prohibited. Also, in many countries it is illegal to breed animals in captivity without the permission of the relevant government department.
Hybridisation of animals is becoming more widespread and more controversial. Genetical engineering has, as yet, made little progress, however, and hybridisation does not always lead to the production of viable offspring. Hybridising cattle with cattle and horses with horses may often be successful, but the offspring are usually sterile. Similarly, crossbreeding sheep and goats in captivity also leads to sterile offspring. When the cross-breeding is between two different domesticated animals of the same species (‘within-species’ crossbreeding) this has been done without serious problems. It is not clear, however, if cattle from zebu breeding and water buffalo breeding could survive if crossed, or could breed fertile offspring. The crossbreeding of these two domestic bovids is a goal of many breeders and farmers. Sheep are being crossbred with goats at the moment, but to have domestic sheep and goats with goats and domestic goats and sheep at the same time would be extremely desirable; crossbreeding is a relatively easy matter compared with crossbreeding different breeds of animals, and
