The split of Bengal into two, along the river Hooghly, was originally done from the capital Calcutta, although it was later moved to Srinagar.

The two regions of Bengal were separated into a new province for North Bengal, which became part of the princely state of North-Eastern Agency, and a new province for West Bengal which became part of the princely state of Bengal Presidency.
