Virgil was the nephew of the emperor Claudius who had him imprisoned during his brother’s reign, then exiled in Sicily. After being permitted to return to Rome, Virgil went on to produce a volume of poems which became one of his most famous works, the Aeneid, from which the following translation is taken.
