 lawsuit alleging they had been sexually assaulted and raped while attending a U.S. Naval Academy boarding school after their ships collided.

Their suit named the Naval Academy, two school officials and three other individuals; not-for-profit organizations that were involved in the Naval Academy's oversight of students as "Jane Does"; and "Admits" organizations.

The suits also named as defendants three individuals: former Naval Academy chief of staff and deputy commander of the U.S. Naval Academy, Rear Adm. Kenneth D. Turner, Commandant of the Naval Academy, Vice Adm. John J. Cressy, Commander of the U.S. Southern Command and former Secretary of the Navy Robert M. McCormick.

The suits alleged that they were forced to drink alcohol, passed out and raped by Turner, who was promoted to Commander of the Naval Academy during Turner's tenure; Cressy, who was promoted from Commanding Officer of the Naval Academy's Headquarters and Control, and McCormick, who was a graduate of the Academy.

On Dec. 12, 2015, Fisher and Michalewicz settled their lawsuit "in consideration of money, benefits, and reasonable attorney's fees." But they stopped short of a final settlement with the school.

Two of the plaintiffs filed their own lawsuit with the Department of Justice against the U.S. Naval Academy, its three "Jane Does," and the "Admits." They alleged the "Jane Does" knew details of the alleged assaults, yet "failed to act" to stop them.

"They knew what they knew," said the plaintiffs' lawyers, Thomas Durkin and Scott Belkin. But "they did not act."
