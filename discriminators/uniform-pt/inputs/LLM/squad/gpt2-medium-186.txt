 their need to survive. During the Jurassic, for example, the size of the dinosaurs depended on the availability of various foods consumed by other herbivores, but today only some carnivores consume grasses.

Evolution has not only changed the diet of individual animals and plant life, but also the species of animals. During the Paleozoic, many groups of dinosaurs and their carnivorous relatives flourished in a diverse range of environments. Among them was the early birds that became the only bird group for about 300 million years.

One of those groups of dinosaurs that did not survive into modern times was the long-necked dinosaur, named the Perihelion. After a series of catastrophic events in the early Triassic period, the Perihelion suddenly came to an end. It became clear that the dinosaurs would need the assistance of birds. It should be said however, that the Perihelion's extinction was caused by meteorite smashing its nest into the Earth's atmosphere, and later into the oceans. In fact the Perihelion was probably only half of the long-necked dinosaur. The other half, found in Mexico, consisted of dinosaur, and crocodilian cousins. For this reason it has become popular to place its death on the Perihelion.

If one wants to know the dinosaur's species, one might ask, "How could the early birds have survived a whole world of dinosaurs and carnivores?" One hypothesis for this is that the early birds evolved to be able to survive without oxygen, to breathe in water as well as breathe it out and therefore had evolved special lungs in
