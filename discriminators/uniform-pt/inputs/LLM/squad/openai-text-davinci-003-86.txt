 a queue of braids. The edict was seen by many Han Chinese as an affront to their traditional customs and religious beliefs since the preference for a queue or ponytail was not a traditional style of haircut for Han men.

Dorgon's edict was part of a strategy for unifying the fractured Ming Dynasty, which had been beset by internal conflict, famine, and foreign aggression from the Manchu people. He wanted to create a unified front against the Manchus by unifying the Chinese under a common hairstyle, which was necessary since the Manchu people wore queues but indigenous Han Chinese did not. By the time of the edict, most of the territories in Ming Dynasty had been occupied by the Manchu invaders and the majority of the Chinese people were under Manchu rule.

The edict provoked much anger and resistance from the Han Chinese people, with many refusing to comply with the orders.Those who refused were punished or publicly humiliated. The order was also seen as an infringement on religious freedoms, with some believers arguing that it violated their right to practice their beliefs.

In recent years, Dorgon's edict has been seen as a symbol of humiliation and cultural assimilation, and is viewed by some as an example of why cultural differences should be respected and celebrated rather than suppressed.
