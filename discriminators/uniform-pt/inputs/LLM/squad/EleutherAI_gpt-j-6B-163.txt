 region.  This process culminated in 1626 under Louis XIII, whose authority over the nobility included the title of royal lieutenant of the crown lands and the ability to issue edicts on noblemen's lands.  The edicts, however, were often ignored by nobles, and many noble vassals refused to pay the taxes or homage owed to the crown.  A particularly egregious example of this phenomenon was when during the French and Spanish war of 1637, Louis XIII declared, with no legal justification, that the Count of Soissons had to fight all his vassals (including his father-in-law, Duke of Nevers) to regain their allegiance to Louis XIII.  His authority was resisted by many nobles, particularly because of the new edicts which forbade them the right to hunt with their own peasants over their demesne.  This edict, the Edict of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, would have led to a violent clash between the nobility and the Paris Parlement.  However, it was not in accordance with the terms of the peace treaty following the French victory, and the Parlement refused to register it.

The edicts did not have much effect on the rural nobles.  Instead, this new form of feudalism was adopted by some of the country nobles, who in turn used this as a means to maintain their independence.  The "great nobles" (grandes nobles), the most powerful noblemen, did not have to fight like peasants to regain the rights of their ancestors, but they did have to pay homage to the king as a means of maintaining royal support.
