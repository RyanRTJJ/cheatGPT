What makes the winter weather unique in Seattle is that it is both warmer than average while snowfall remains below average. The average December daytime temperature of 74 degrees is 1 degree higher than normal for Seattle, while below average for this time of year.

That means that the most extreme cold weather we experience is often at night. Cold weather can occur later than expected for that season due to the shorter daylight hours, so the temperature can vary by a few degrees. On top of that, an early snow storm or freezing rain can also create heavy snow.

With no snow forecast to fall this week, the rain that is expected to soak the region is expected to move eastward, but it will not stick or be a significant problem for people who live near the lakes.

The snow should be light, and most won't notice much of an impact from the precipitation. Some areas will see at least a light dusting and the snow could come by snow plow as well â€“ that's just something to keep in mind.

For this reason, I don't expect any significant impacts by the snowfall to rain. The rain is expected to start Sunday and continue through Tuesday, so I wouldn't anticipate the roads to be clogged, but I do anticipate the area to be heavily affected by freezing rain Sunday night and for the rest of
