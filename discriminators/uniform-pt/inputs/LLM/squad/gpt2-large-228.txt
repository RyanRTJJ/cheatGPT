 with most lines serving the province from the city of Stuttgart to Mälndal and several smaller towns along the main routes.

The Thuringian Railway was built under the direction of Wilhelm Thünen (1832-1882), a well known Thuringian writer, poet and teacher, who served as head of the railway and the head of the city's Department of Planning during the era when the municipality was known as Hanover. In addition to running a fast and comfortable railway, but also including some other services, Thünen also served as a cultural ambassador for the Thuringian state, touring to Europe and North America to speak and write. (He also wrote a book called The History of the German-Speaking Peoples: Volume I, 1867-1867).

The line from Berlin to Mälndal, the Thuringian Railway's northern terminus, was completed in 1866. Trains to Mälndal from the other ends of the line to Berlin would soon be completed. In 1890, the trains were equipped with a steam engine, running at a speed of 120 km/h. At the end of 1930, the line was renamed the Thuringian Railway.

By the 1920s, the Thuringian Railway provided direct connections with the railways serving the German provinces of Brandenburg and Hamburg. The Thuringian Railway also served north-west Germany with trains to Kiel and Wittenberg and the province of Nordrhein-Westfalen, as well as Hamburg. From the late 1960s onward, the lines were linked to the East German Trains (Berlin to Düsseldorf, Graz to Bremen and Munich to Stuttgart) and the West German Stadtbahn (Buchholz to Berlin, Berlin to Würzburg and Cologne to Bad München). After the fall of the Berlin wall on 11 November 1989, the train line from Thuringia to Mälndal, the Thuringian Railway's northern terminus, was transferred from West Germany to North West
