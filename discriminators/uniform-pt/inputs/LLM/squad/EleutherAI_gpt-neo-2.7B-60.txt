 to be ‘non reactive or tolerant’ and so are pre-school children. While at school, they can develop allergic reactions because of increasing exposure to bacteria, fungi, pollen and dust that triggers immune responses. By adolescence, individuals develop a more complex immune system, with the development of Th2 cells at this time increasing their ability to fight allergic responses.

Th2 cytokines suppress adaptive immunity, creating an environment in which the immune system tends to become activated in response to many antigenic triggers. This leads to allergic skin rash, asthma and more. The Th2 response also stimulates the immune system to produce a substance called IgE antibody, which is thought to be the main reason for the immune response to an allergen. This is why children over the age of five have more likely reactions to any allergen (e.g. dust mixtures).

Th2 and Th1 responses are different in nature and can have a mutually beneficial association. In the Th2 model, IgE production is induced by the release of a cytokine called IL-4 and results in the production of IgE; in the Th1 model, IL-4 is blocked or “silenced” so that the activation of mast cells, basophils and eosinophils is inhibited. This in turn prevents the release of mast cell and basophil degranulation products; at the same time, it reduces the release of immunoglobulin E from B-lymphocytes – which induces type-I cell-mediated responses from
