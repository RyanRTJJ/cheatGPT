vasive species cause many negative effects (see my prior post http://bit.ly/1FdEJpH) from the way their behavior changes the natural landscapes in which we live. It is also a concern that many invasive species do not move quickly enough when introduced.

I've been in contact with several invasive species authors this week, and I've heard a new one is published in Science this week. It looks like the new paper addresses the second point I had been considering in my post.

The paper is called: "New insights into the fate of the invasive ant species Bemisia annua: The fate of the Asian giant armyworm in its native range."

They surveyed hundreds of people worldwide who live near giant species ant ranges to find out how they react. The study also included researchers who investigated local ant populations in the native range, as well as researchers who collected the ant populations and had access to the local area that the ants were invading. The authors then analyzed the local ant population and found that the ants did not leave once they arrived in the area because they were there to feast on local plants and insects. There is some data showing that the Asian giant armyworm leaves the area once it realizes that there are no natural enemies there to eat the ants that it has evolved to kill, but I don't know that they can definitively show this. One possible explanation may
