the teacher of the gods." Despite their power and wealth, the Rinbungs were not seen as the "superior" beings by Karma. Even more importantly to him, they were not able to perform the Mahayana teachings and practice. Although Karma was a Buddhist monk at the time, he had come to believe he could use his Buddhist faith to lead the Rinbungs towards the Mahayana path. He believed there was a need to unify the Rinbungs so they would have an advantage and he formed the Vajradhara Vajrayogini Association.

Because of this, they became notorious figures. Even the king of Thailand, Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, was said to have spoken
