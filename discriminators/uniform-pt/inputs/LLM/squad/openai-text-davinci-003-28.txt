 include the male line ancestors of Modern Eastern European Jews, often referred to as Ashkenazim, as well as the male line ancestors of the Sephardic Jews whose descendants live mainly in Middle Eastern, North African and Hispanic countries. 

The ancestors of Ashkenazim and Sephardim are believed to have split around 2000-2500 years ago. The Arab invasions of the 7th century CE and the Crusader invasions of the 11th century CE may have also played a role in their separation. Ashkenazim subsequently settled in Eastern and Central Europe, whereas Sephardim settled in the Middle East, North Africa and Iberia.

Recent Y-DNA studies point to a single male line ancestor shared by both Ashkenazim and Sephardim, though the exact relationship is still debated. These studies suggest that Ashkenazim and Sephardim may have once been part of a single population that originated in the Middle East, and that some ancestral populations of Sephardic Jews may have migrated back to the Middle East following the collapse of the western empire and the expulsion of Jews from Iberia in the 15th century. This is consistent with mitochondrial DNA studies which point to a shared Near Eastern origin between Ashkenazim and Sephardim. 

At the same time, there is evidence to suggest that some Ashkenazi Jews have a more diverse genetic background, with admixture from European populations.
