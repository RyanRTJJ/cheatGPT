h Republic, in a settlement dubbed "Valašské předměstí". This site is from the period known as Linear Pottery culture (LPC) and is one of the earliest examples of a farming community.

In the 4th and 3rd millennia BC farming spread from southeast Europe to Central Europe, arriving in what is now the Czech Republic in the form of the Corded Ware culture. This culture made use of the advanced techniques already in use in southeast Europe, such as ploughing, irrigation and crop rotation.

The settlers of the region also adopted the practice of animal husbandry, as evidenced by numerous animal bones that have been unearthed in archaeological excavations of Corded Ware sites. This period also saw the emergence of early settlements with traces of fortifications, suggesting an increased social complexity and the emergence of chiefdoms. This period also saw the emergence of the first proto-urban centers, such as the fortified settlement of Levý Hradec in what is now the Czech Republic.

In south eastern Europe the Iron Age Dynasties of Thracians and Celts were two of the most prominent forces at this period. The Thracians were considered one of the most advanced societies in the region, and their civilization was highly organized, with strong fortifications and advanced technology. Thracian agrarian societies developed many of the same technologies that were found in their southeastern European counterparts, such as irrigation, animal husbandry, terracing and the use of the plough for farming. The Celts were also active in the region and developed their own advanced agrarian societies with similar technologies.

The emergence of the Roman Empire and later the spread of Christianity in the region lead to a profound transformation
