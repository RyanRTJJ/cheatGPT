 can lead to more stable government, but can also cause gridlock where one party is needed to hold the government together - see government in the United Kingdom for two prime Ministers and one minority coalition of the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats. This is one reason why countries which do not have proportional representation tend to be less stable than countries with single member constituencies.

However, there are also major countries with two-party systems, such as Sweden. In Sweden, this is also partly attributed to changes in Swedish political culture. Sweden has never had proportional representation and currently has a two-party system.

There are a certain number of democracies in which the country's politics is split between two parties, each of which may or may not be ideologically identical:

The Netherlands

Denmark/Sweden

Canada

New Zealand
