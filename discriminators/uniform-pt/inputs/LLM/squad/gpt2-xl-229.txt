 1872, President Cleveland suggested that black immigrants be accepted as a source of new labor. Two years later, the Congress passed the Immigration Act, which called for all "infants, babies, children who have never had the benefit of education, in a civilized condition," to be denied all benefits of citizenship. In 1922, President Richard M. Nixon asked Congress to create an executive order to eliminate quotas for labor from "as many native born or naturalized aliens as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this order," and President Eisenhower also sought to put restrictions on "illegal aliens," specifically referring to the Chinese. In 1946, Congress passed the National Origins Act, mandating the "affirmative purpose" of quotas requiring that "as many immigrant quotas as are needed in the aggregate for the purpose of satisfying the national interest."

The 1952 National Origins Act further banned those who were admitted to the United States on birthright. The Act was passed with a unanimous vote of both houses of Congress. It was implemented in 1952.

For decades, the American public seemed content with the status quo. But with the passage of the 1965 Immigration Act, a new and controversial policy was born.

The Immigration Action Committee of New York was formed the same year the 1965 Act passed, and its president, Carl L. LaRochelle, became a leader in the effort to remove the veil of illegal immigrants from the U.S. population. LaRochelle advocated a restriction of the visa program for immigrants.
