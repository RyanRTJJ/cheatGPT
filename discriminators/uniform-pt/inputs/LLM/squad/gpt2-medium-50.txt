 orientation forms an individual identification, independent of cultural and individual contexts.

In this article, the objective is to extend our knowledge about identity change in adolescents with a specific focus on this area. However, this is also a subject of future research that will allow us to assess whether the concept of adolescent development is the only determinant of future identification of adolescents with type I or III development of egocentrism.

The main goals of this study were to provide preliminary results of a study whose main goal is to analyze the association of identity and identity orientation differences, as well as self-concept or identity theory, and whether adolescence is a time where some individuals grow as strong as others.

In addition, our main goal was to determine what influences are involved in identity development in adolescence, how the influence of identity and identity orientation differs depending on whether some individuals are egocentric or "non-egocentric" as indicated by their expression and actions, or vice versa. If an individual has more "ego". "ego" is a term derived from the Greek sense of the German word Ego or Egin, meaning "self". In general, the development of g, is influenced by identity orientation and as discussed previously, is influenced by identity orientation. Although the different factors that affect the development of egotism are not mutually exclusive, these factors influence each other most strongly and may lead to different developmental outcomes.

In this study, two independent samples were chosen, one of male non-social-scholarship students from an East London high school (D.W.S.) and the other of self-selected male students (M.S.), a population who are also egocentric, but whose egocentric behavior is also influenced by identity and identity theory. The two samples were divided in sociolinguistic ways based on gender (W.D.S. and R.V.) and ethnic background (H."K.R.") to minimize possible sociological problems. The study also included an interview about the nature of each sample and about a range of social issues in the form of the social context in which two members of the same generation discussed their life,
