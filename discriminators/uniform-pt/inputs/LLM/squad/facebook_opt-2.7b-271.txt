men to support the national defense act (and thus allow for the creation and funding of a military force and the purchase of armaments). In 1962, Democrat Harold "Bud" O'Leary was elected as the first African-American mayor of St. Paul in Minnesota.

1946â€“1992
The political landscape in the 1970s and 1980s underwent explosive growth. By the mid-1970s, St. Paul had become a predominantly liberal suburb (known as an "edge city"). In 1978, the North Star Council was formed to represent the political base around St. Paul's metropolitan area, eventually growing with suburban additions in the region including Maplewood and Stillwater. By the late 1980s, the Democratic Party was heavily in control of local government: in 1990, a majority of city elected officials were Democrats or endorsed the Democratic Party during an internal election. At the same time, the Republican Party had a small presence in St. Paul and neighboring areas across the state.

During the 1991 Republican National Convention, Minneapolis police fired teargas and pepper spray at protesters who had gathered in opposition to the convention. The protests were condemned by both Mayor Norm Coleman and Governor Arne Carlson. Minnesota's governor stated that "peace will be maintained by any law enforcement action taken on August 25." Police initially used teargas and pepper spray to disperse the crowd, which then ran toward police, setting up several skirmishes before protesters were eventually dispersed again
