 the men in green and the football team rose in status and the school grew in enrollment, prestige, and prestige.

From 1924-1929 Notre Dame was nationally ranked in football, had a national recruiting class, and had a significant athletic budget and its football team was ranked in the top four teams in the nation.

In 1930, the football team had its first winning season in football (13-0) and had won the national championship for the third consecutive year.

The school's athletic budget had grown to $8.2 million, and was being subsidized by the government. In 1920 Notre Dame's athletics budget was $1.5 million, the same as its football team, the men's basketball team, and the school's two baseball teams.

The athletic budget continued to grow year after year, and the school's financial burden was only growing heavier with it. The football team had to pay players salaries in addition to the team salary.

By 1930-1931 the school's finances were becoming impossible to justify.

Unable to raise funds and with athletics in serious decline, the university found itself in a situation of dire straits and desperation.

The football team's financial burden continued to grow and the team's salary had to increase.

In a decision unprecedented in both Notre Dame history and in American football, the school made a payment of $1.6 million in 1933 to cover the debts of the football program.
