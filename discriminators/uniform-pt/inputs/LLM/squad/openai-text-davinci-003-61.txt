 and Italy) were key players in the formation of the modern university system. Northern universities were heavily influenced by the expansion of the university system under the Holy Roman Empire, which included the reformation of teaching practices, the structure of study and research, and the organization of universities with faculties. This system was also heavily influenced by the Protestant Reformation, as Protestant universities sought to place emphasis on biblical interpretation as part of their curricula. Northern universities tended to be more focused on science, law and theology, while universities in the south placed more emphasis on the study of the humanities, such as art, music, and languages.

The development of universities in the north and south also developed in different ways due to their respective political systems. Northern universities were generally state-sponsored, allowing for a more structured approach to education. Southern universities relied heavily on private patronage and were therefore more free to be independent in their organizational structure and academic content. This led to a greater variety of courses and teaching styles in southern universities compared to those in the north. 

In the modern era, the differences between northern and southern university cultures still remain, though they have become less pronounced. Northern universities still place more emphasis on science and professional disciplines while Southern universities continue to prioritize the humanities. However, the differences between the two have lessened with the wider availability of higher education in both regions and the growth of international student exchange programs.
