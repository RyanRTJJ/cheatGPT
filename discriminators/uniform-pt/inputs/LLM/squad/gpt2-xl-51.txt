 much blood they required. "Some patients complained of a sense of warmth," Schachter said. "Others described pain." Schachter studied medical records from 40 patients. "The pain was less in those who received epinephrine," he said, "and the warmth was greater."

It was a clear and convincing proof, but it was almost immediately undermined by a series of critics. Some, such as Peter Weiss, a medical historian who wrote a widely read critique in 1998, noted that the technique was used in Spain for centuries before it won the backing of mainstream medical science. Others, such as Thomas Young, a professor at Dartmouth and medical adviser to the pharmaceutical industry, countered that Schachter had cherry-picked his data to fit an agenda, including in one case showing a connection between epinephrine and heart attacks.

Young pointed out that a 2009 study by the European Society of Cardiology found that epinephrine increased the death rate from coronary artery disease by more than 25 per cent. "He is not alone in trying to convince the world that epinephrine does everything," Young wrote. "But the reality is that epinephrine doesn't do anything."

Yet the controversy has persisted. Critics say that in their zeal to find the link between epinephrine and cardiac arrest, they have ignored the fact that many other types of drugs also have a serious effect on cardiac function.
