 in 48 BC by the same Virgil. Virgil then composed the Georgics between 40 and 28 BC, and was a friend and teacher of Aeneas at the Academy of Athens (42–40 BC). After Virgil's death, it is thought that he was a member of the Eclogues of Sertorius, although this is disputed.

The Georgics is in three parts, a prose part and prose and sonnet part (1–13). The prose section is divided into 24 parts, each of which is called an epithalmus, and this order is followed for the sonnet portion, in which each part is called a sonnett. The Georgics' two epithalamias were the most famous poems from the work for centuries, but have been superseded by other epithalamias and sonnetts. The prose parts are divided between the poems Aeneid and Georgics, as well as two short speeches. The Georgics' prose, however, is usually referred to just as the "Georgics", because as a prose work it is the only one of the three parts that is divided into lines.

The Georgics was written in Rome in 42 BC as a response to the attacks of his friend, the poet Aeneas, as he crossed through the Roman peninsula, now Italy and the Balkans. Aeneas was an advocate of a cause that Aeneas believed would unite the Roman people against the neighbouring peoples, but Aeneas was opposed by most of the Roman populace at the time and he, Aeneas, was imprisoned. In the Georgics Virgil offers an alternative account to Aeneas' own story, in which he is portrayed as being a man of honour and goodness instead of the villain.

Virgil also wrote the four poems Aeneid (c. 15 BC – 3 BCE) which describe the life of Aeneas before he went to found Rome, the epic Ossian (c. 15 BC – 35 BCE), and the ode Alleluia. Virgil's own father is presented in Aeneid as a virtuous but foolish man, who was a source of much ridicule, who tried to impress his son by presenting Virgil with an effigy of Hercules
