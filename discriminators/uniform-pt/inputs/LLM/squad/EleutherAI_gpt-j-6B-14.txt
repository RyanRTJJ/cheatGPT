 pamphlet claimed that while the “virtuous,” who were loyal to the monarch, were indeed noble, the ignoble, whether Catholics, Protestants, or Jews, were a base lower class. In other words, these were the very people who could “bear the yoke of bondage” to the King.[1]

In 1776, the same author, Georges-Jacques Danton—a man more than a little notorious for his radicalism—proclaimed this “mob,” and they alone, to be the political nation. It was the people in general who deserved to own all property because “the more virtuous we become,” Danton claimed, “the more we shall own.”[2]

The French people, then, were no longer a community, they were no longer a nation. They had become a “nation” by political definition, or else a mere collective of men. In his “The Principles of the People,” Rousseau even suggested that, instead of citizens, the French people should be known as “democrats,” because they would democratically self-govern themselves. By the mid-1780s, Danton and his friends were using the concept of an “homogeneous” people in their political debates, calling for the establishment of a unified “political nation,” “in which each citizen contributes to the common interest.” That is, it was no longer a people composed of distinct classes, but rather a people defined by political membership.[3]

But by the end of the 18th century, the term had been stripped of its political ideology. During the French Revolution, the revolutionists used it as little more than a synonym for the “people,” a term with great popular resonance and political meaning. When the revolutionary leaders proclaimed “the people” to be the sovereign entity, they were using the term strictly as a political one, and not in the ideology and the “class” sense of the revolution. It was a term of political solidarity in the new popular government over and against an oligarchy.[4]
