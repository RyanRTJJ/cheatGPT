, disgust), intensity (e.g., pleasure, love), affective valence (e.g., pleasant, unpleasant), or appraisals (e.g., desirable, undesirable) and temporal patterns (e.g., short-term, long-term) (Goleman, 1995; Harkness in Harkness, 1994; Lazarus, 1991; McAdams et al., 2001). The main advantages of this approach are that: (a) it is simple enough to use with individuals and small groups and (b) it can be used for quantitative and qualitative comparative analyses. It is also simple to administer and requires very little cognitive effort to comprehend, even by nonscientists (see Table 1). However, a common criticism of this approach is that it does not account for the underlying psychological processes that trigger these types of behavior, and as a result, researchers may lack understanding of what is going on when an emotion is induced.

However, a more integrative way to examine the basic processes involved in the induction of emotions is by the use of the social psychology of emotions. For instance, Levenson and colleagues (see Levenson, 2008) examined the effects of facial and vocal stimuli on individualsâ€™ moods (e.g., happy, sad, angry, irritated, proud, disgusted, etc.). In a recent paper, these researchers used a facial electromyography, facial expression, and cardiovascular data to examine the effects of vocal emotion, such as laughter, on the induction of emotional states (Levenson, 2008). In another research study, researchers used a facial electromyography system and video analysis to examine the differential effects of verbal emotional cues on emotional face recognition (Wang et al., 2008).
