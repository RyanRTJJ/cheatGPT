the one under the river).


To reduce speed, the water taxi operator used the plough to drop onto a path of the road. The water taxi operator dropped to the bottom of the line, which crossed the street. This way the taxi could get its passengers to their destination without breaking the bank.


From this approach, the operator used the plough and used air conditioning to cut out the current flowing through the gap between two main traffic lanes. The operator used the plough to cut out the current in the area behind them which had the potential to allow a better view of the city (where there would be a better chance of passing by if air and traffic flows through). This was done to ensure there was enough flow for the operator to be at the center of the flow.


It's also not known if this method of carrying current back into the street was used by any taxi company in the United Kingdom.

What We Learned From Our Experiments

Café operators should always assume that their cars will not be in trouble if their traffic is very slow or if their traffic is very low. That means that there should be no problems when the driver is travelling very fast (or if there are many cars on the road). Therefore taxi operators should always use the correct approaches to cut the current.

Cafés do use air conditioning to allow the flow of air back into the street. Because people who breathe through a plough could not see or breathe through a pipe in the flow on the street, it is recommended that they breathe through and take a low pressure air filter.

It is also not recommended
