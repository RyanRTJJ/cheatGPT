 tracks, or a separate uncompressed digital audio track.

In a nutshell, a stereo headset is a set of six channels. A stereo speaker is either a single mono output or an isolated 1/2 inch-diameter (45 degrees) surround stream of speakers. The speakers can also be located either in front or behind the head as opposed to in the back or front. In this sense, it is called a panoramic or vertical listening system. Panoramic systems, by definition, allow sound to be sent from two or more listening positions. The headphones on the front of a stereo headset let sound flow from behind, with sound of the front loudspeakers reaching the rear speakers. Sound can also be transmitted from each listening position, and sound can go from one position to the next or from both audio and sound. The ears, the nose, the ear buds, and the nose and ear buds are all affected by sound and that affects what we listen to.

To see how the headset would sound in two adjacent speakers, we'll compare the stereo signal of the ear buds on an O2 with two cans mounted adjacent to one another at the base of the head. A comparison of the O2 with three similarly positioned cans would provide us with the same sound, except that the 3s will be closer together. Note also that the 3s can listen to more than
