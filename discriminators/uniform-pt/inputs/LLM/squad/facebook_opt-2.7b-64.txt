. This makes birds more efficient in using energy for their daily needs. Birds have more efficient metabolisms than reptiles, and the same goes for other mammals. A common, more recent example of this is the highly efficient consumption of carbohydrates by humans.

The Urinetech UrinExoskeleton

The Urinetech UrinExoskeleton, which will be available for pre-orders beginning April 2011, is the first product of the Urinetech UiTEC Consortium, which was established in response to the urgent need to manufacture exoskeletons suitable for long-term, high-energy terrestrial flight as a high-tech solution to the problem of catastrophic fossil fuel scarcity.

The Urinetech UrinExoskeleton consists of three main parts:

The Urinetech UiTEC Core, made of a bioengineered rubber that is designed to be biocompatible with human cells, it houses electrical, actuator, and sensor systems

The Urinetech UiTEC Exoskeleton, covered with a thick layer of ultra-light carbon fiber composite, and a special layer of ultra-light metal that provides the aircraft with structural rigidity. It is designed to be lightweight, safe, and self-righting without the use of pilot-controls similar to those found on fighter jets

The Urinetech UiTEC Ultralight Carbon Composite Lifter, designed to be very light, simple to assemble (and disassemble) with a user-replaceable battery. It provides power to the Ultralight Carbon Composite Lifter when necessary, and it provides long-term protection against the elements at low-altitude flight

These three components have been designed, developed, and manufactured in partnership by scientists from the University of Florida and the University of Utah. The
