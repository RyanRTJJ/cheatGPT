oths have a pair of highly sensitive ocular organs called lens.

As a young spider, its eyes can detect light, not the color or wavelength of light. These insects are called 'light sensitive', because they possess a strong sense of seeing the dark.

Habitable areas for reproduction in the Southern Hemisphere are much larger than in the North.

So, where will the world become if we leave Europe? To a large extent, the world will remain a very different place from what it's currently, but some areas that do see light will suffer serious consequences as a result.

The sun may heat up your home as opposed to simply a nearby power line, but other impacts on global warming may have the opposite effect.
