 average grade point of 3.01. The report was the result of a pilot project which saw 16 junior and senior students of average mathematical ability undertake a rigorous mathematical selection test for entry into the Gymnasium School. In total 16 students were involved in the study, 10 of whom had successfully passed through the Gymnasium, with five failing to qualify and another five leaving school after three years.

The Gymnasium consists of five classrooms with approximately 180 pupils and is located at the top of a hill in the city. Most of the pupils in the school have families in the city, with a limited number of students living out of the city in private housing. The school is known for its rigorous academic standards and generally poor results.

According to the director of the Gymnasium school, "These are the best results we've ever had. I think it is because we've got a more focused and structured curriculum." The school is required by the Education Ministry to offer a rigorous mathematical curriculum.

While it is generally considered that only the top one thousand students in grades nine through twelve will study for a mathematically based science degree, recent research revealed that this is a grossly inaccurate view. In total more than 70 percent of the university students involved, were found to possess skills
