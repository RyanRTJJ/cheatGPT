I got this message from my son that said if "his dream" or "his love" could win this case against his abuser, he "would be so heartened and encouraged". So we were going to go on vacation. We could have canceled but had a funeral for a dear friend who had passed away a little more than 3 weeks ago.

I hope and pray he does the right thing to win. Letting go can mean a release from an addiction. There was the story about the person the OP told about who had a friend who killed a family member. I believe that if God will send him the right person at the right time.

For the avoidance of doubt, I am not going to give my name (and I don’t believe I am supposed to!) but I am glad to support anyone who says something, anywhere, that they believe is true. And it does not matter if you are an atheist, a Satanist, a Christian, or a Muslim because whatever God chooses He will keep until the end of the world is
