mon. During this time, the anime has already received positive reactions from Japan and overseas, receiving top spot in various magazines, as well as many foreign press screenings. The series started being produced, however, in the fall 2011, only four episodes have been broadcast. At this point in time, there is no official release date as of yet (April 4, 2016 is reported to be the final scheduled release date), but as Digimon creator Akihiko Fujiwara stated that they were working on a new series based on the series from the second installment until the present (May 14, 2016; the anime will be screened on June 9, 2016 in the US), I would presume it's slated to be a long-run title in anime, so it's also safe to assume it's going to be an animated series as well.

The series follows the adventures of three new Digimon called Spiritmon. While Spiritmon seem like they will be some of the most popular characters in the series' history, they don't have the charisma or charisma that is the standard of characters such as Digimon Monarchs in the "new" series, Digimon Tamers (though they are still the most popular series among younger digimon followers). Instead, they appear to have some of a more laidback, humorous personality. They appear to be somewhat shy and even timid and even more reserved than Digimon Tamers' Digimon Master, though none of them will admit that in private. While sometimes having a hard time accepting others, they don't seem to be shy in public either.
