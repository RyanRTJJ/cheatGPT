 and has been utilized in cooking and to make jewelry. As a result, it has been in the collection of the Chicago Art Museum since 1922 and the Los Angeles Metropolitan Museum since 1957. It has also been in the collections of the Museum of Anthropology in Philadelphia, Georgia and the Guggenheim Museum of Art in Bilbao, Spain.

The copper was found in Mexico, a region that is known for its copper rich mines. From Mexico they traveled to Peru and then north across the Andes. Along the way they came across a land of copper alluvium, which is an area much more resistant to mining than the surrounding area. Copper can only be found in areas where it has not been mined for centuries. They came to the Americas at approximately 16,000 BC. As they moved further inland they came across another indigenous culture – the Incas – that adopted copper. The Incas also used copper to make the famous Aztec Mayan weapons and were responsible for some of the most important artifacts from the Mesoamerican world.

Although the discovery of copper at Chaco Canyon has changed the history of metal in the Americas, it is not something that everyone is thrilled about. Copper was also mined in other places in the world before, such as the Black Sea region of Bulgaria and elsewhere. It is very likely that other, similarly metal-rich areas in the area also have copper.

"Copper is a rare metal found in the Mesoamerican Peninsula and along other coastlines surrounding the Americas," said Dr. John Shanks, a professor of anthropology at UCLA and the co-author on the new study. "It was mined to
