 and so on in a cycle of food relationships. It is this reciprocal role that inspired these small, round-leafed plants' name.



Pachysandra procumbens

The genus 'pachysandra' is one of seven genera in the Pachysandra Section (S. Pachysandrae) of the Pinxaceae family, most of them large shrubs or small trees. It has the smallest number of species of any of the Pinxaceae sections. The genus is widespread through much of the northern part of Eurasia and North America. The common name "false spirea" refers exclusively to Pachysandra procumbens. It's leaves are usually more narrow than those of the related P. dulcis. In fact, there are at least 24 species in this genus, but many of them are quite different from Pachysandra procumbens in all respects except for this unusual leaf shape.



Pachysandra procumbens grows in both temperate and alpine areas from northern Fennoscandia to northernmost Alaska. It also grows in both Arctic and alpine areas of northwestern North America and Eurasia. It is often found growing on rock or snow, but it is surprisingly common and widespread.

Flower and seed colors



Pachysandra procumbens is white when new, turning grey-green as the season progresses. It has no scent. It blooms all summer in the northern part of its range, but in the more southern part it blooms in spring and summer.

In the North America and Europe, the flower color is mostly yellow, a trait that is rare in this genus. Most of this species' yellow colors are only on the lower leaves and
