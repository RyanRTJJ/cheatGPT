By the request of Charles Lyell, Darwin and Wallace presented a joint paper on the Theory of Natural Selection to the Linnean Society on 1 July 1858. Although Wallace was unaware at the time, this paper marked the beginning of the modern science of evolutionary biology. 

The joint paper received great interest among both naturalists and the general public. The work of Darwin and Wallace was seen to confirm existing theories on Nature.

The joint paper served as a model for how two scientists could co-publish their research and made it possible for many more to follow. In the years that followed, their works inspired important discoveries in the field of evolution, and Darwin's ideas have
