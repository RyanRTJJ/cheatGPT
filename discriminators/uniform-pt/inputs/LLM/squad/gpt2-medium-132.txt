We all know about the French capture of Vienna, but here are some reasons why we should actually start investing in those muskets.

At that time, the population was mostly Romanians (who were still allied with them and, therefore, under their protection, due to its size) and Germans (who they held prisoners and deported to Brest, Hungary). The German losses were about 5,000 soldiers from each of those 2 armies respectively. The Austrian losses were about 250,000 civilians.

To save their people from further slaughter, the French and Americans decided on a strategy to try and convince these refugees to join the forces of Napoleon, thus saving 1,000 men from being killed in their native land. During this time, the Alsatians gave up their autonomy and were incorporated. During the first year of the campaign, French troops had captured about 80.000 muskets, 150.000 cartridges, and 800krts in addition to 80,000 rifles as well as the 10,000.
