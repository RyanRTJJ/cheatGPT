ppella polyphony was based around four-part, harmonically-oriented textures. This form was developed through the early 17th century and became known as the "a cappella choirs" of the Baroque period. These choirs were primarily used for sacred music and developed pieces based on the Church modes. The roots of a cappella music in the Western Christian tradition are very deep, stretching back to the earliest days of the Church itself. As musical instruments were not allowed in the Church, early Christian music was primarily vocal and a cappella. Later, when instruments were allowed, churches continued to use traditional a cappella music for hymns, spiritual songs, and chants. Modern a cappella music has developed into an art form, bringing together elements of various musical styles, such as gospel, classical, jazz, and pop.
