es towards Austria. On August 12, Napoleon issued the famous Art of War decree, ordering the mobilization of French forces. This triggered a series of events that set off the War of the Third Coalition. The opening hostilities of the war were concentrated in the German states, where Austrians and Russians were preparing for an invasion of France. On August 26, 1805, Napoleon’s Grande Armée crossed the Rhine River, beginning the famous Ulm Campaign, which would drive a wedge between the Austrians and Russians. In early October, Napoleon's forces decisively defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Austerlitz, which forced them to make peace with France. Napoleon then turned his attention to the Russians, leading his forces in a pursuit of the Russian army, culminating in the Battle of Eylau—the first major confrontation in the east. After six days of fighting, the Russians were forced to retreat and lay siege to the city of Königsberg. Over the next three months, the Russians continued to retreat, and on December 14, 1805, Napoleon reached the city of Vilna and defeated a numerically superior Russian force at the Battle of Austerlitz. With their defeat, the Russians were forced to accept Napoleon's terms and sign the Treaty of Tilsit, ending the War of the Third Coalition.
