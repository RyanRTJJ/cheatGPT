 the Xishu (, 'Sea Barbarians'), including the Gan, Muyue and Wuyue tribes.[5]

With the expansion of the Zhou dynasty, its political influence gradually spread from the north, through the central plains and on to the south, where it established a number of localities. This movement was greatly aided by the fact that some of the inhabitants of Zhejiang had moved northwards to assist the Shang in overthrowing the Zhou's predecessor, the Zhou-Liaodong Confederation.

The earliest documented Zhou-dynasty records of Zhou territory are found in the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Marquis of Jin (Chunqiu), dating from about 771 BC. They report that the State of Zhou, or Zhou (), came into existence in about 1046 BC in Zhongshan () of present-day Zhejiang Province, that in the late 12th century, the Zhou conquered and re-established itself in Nanyang, and that in the early 11th century it became the ruling house of the whole former Zhou-Liaodong Confederation. The same accounts give an account of the Zhou's initial conquest of the Xishu areas.

It was during the Spring and Autumn period when the Zhou expanded to the south. In 1046, the Zhou became established in the north of the Former Shang's homeland - the state of Guizhou (桂都),[6] then in about 1004 BC it took Jiangyang (義陽). By the end of the Spring and Autumn period in 1050, the state of Zhou had taken over the whole of Central China, with its southern frontiers set in Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan Island.[7]

In the second half of the Spring and Autumn period, the Zhou conquered and took over the Former Shang heartland, and then moved further westwards to the Jiangbei coast, on the east coast of present Zhejiang province. At this time, the area along the north and east coasts of present Zhejiang was a collection of small fishing villages with numerous small states, such as Fenghao (飛浩), Yue, and the states of Shu
