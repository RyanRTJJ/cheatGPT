 thousand people in the United States were riding cable-borne elevators each year. No one has ever been killed from the injuries sustained while riding cable-borne elevators. There isn't a single case of a cable-borne elevator passenger losing consciousness. (The accident of August 18, 1982, when a cable-borne elevator traveling in a vertical direction in New York's Times Square fell victim to gravity suggests that there was a mechanical issue on the elevator that caused it to fall backwards.) The largest single death from a cable-borne elevator occurred in May of this year, as an elevator traveling in the wrong direction in a North Chicago Tower elevator was on the fifth floor. Eleven members of a family of three were killed. A video obtained by CBS News in May shows the elevator vehicle being brought down through its floor and roof by the force of impact. The driver of the elevator was not hurt. Despite this, cable-borne elevators should never be used to access confined spaces. Never, ever go up or down a cable-borne elevator. It is very easy to become trapped inside this elevator, and once trapped, you have little time or chance of escaping. The most common form of cable-borne elevator accident is known as a horizontal cable break. A horizontal cable break occurs when a cable breaks at an angle, usually at the side of the elevator (see diagrams A and B for various horizontal cable breaks). The type of horizontal cable break depends on the elevator manufacturer, and the exact angle of the break. Some elevator manufacturers will prevent horizontal cable break deaths by installing safety guards such as railings within the elevator. If you are in a cable-borne elevator, always be sure to stay in the elevator, to let your seat belt fasten and to use your door stop. Also stay out of the elevator and in your seat until your seat belt is fastened and your door is closed. If anything was to happen to you, the elevator would not be able to stop itself, and the passengers in the elevator above you would be trapped. Never use your elevator to get to other elevators or your building entrance. Use a stairway or an elevator if you have time.
