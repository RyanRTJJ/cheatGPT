Demetrius defeated the Macedonians in the battle of the Granicus, in which he took the city of Phokis, and proceeded north along the Black Sea to the Persian Gulf. He took Persia's first and most important capital, Ctesiphon, and began the conquest of the province of Iran (modern Iran), hoping to secure the necessary resources for the reconquest of Macedon. Demetrius's victories at Ctesiphon, however, provided no long-term success, and Demetrius had to retreat from Persian ground in 300 BCE, after the battle of Megalopolis.

He returned to Macedonia, but two years later Demetrius died in battle against the Romans at Mount Caucasus. He was succeeded in 306 by his son Philip III.
