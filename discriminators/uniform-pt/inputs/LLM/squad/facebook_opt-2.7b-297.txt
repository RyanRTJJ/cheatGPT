 Although the "tapes" are long out of print, an uncut 35mm roll of the original "Milt Gabler's Lighthouse" release now survives, made around 1938 from multiple 12-inch tapes.

The record contains 4 tracks:

1) The "Music of the Lighthouse" (a collection of jazz tunes)
2) "The Sound for the Lighthouse" (acoustic music to be played while the lighthouse is being built -- originally recorded April 8, 1938 -- but was not released until 1941)
3) "Song of the Lighthouse" (written by Gabler's brother John and composed by Gabler's nephew, James Gabler)
4) "Swinging the Lighthouse"

The recording also contains some sound effects created by Milt Gabler, such as the sound of the hammer on the anvil or the sound of him pounding on a bucket.

The recordings were originally intended for a series of 12-inch discs made by Commodore Records in conjunction with Paramount Pictures, produced in 1936-1937. The "Lighthouse" release was part of a new series of 78 rpm discs, made with a new sound system called "Sonic Blue", but the discs were lost in the archives of Commodore Records in the 1960s.

In addition to the original acetate from the original sound mix, the copy on this site from the 1980s is also made up of several tracks of new re-mixed material, some of which has never been heard before.

These newly-mixed versions and all related material was first put on tape in July 1994 by Gabler's nephew, William Gabler, who was then in his 80th year. Although we now have a complete copy of Gabler's original recordings, we still haven't heard them. William Gabler, Milt's great-nephew and Milt's son-in-law, passed away the day after the tapes were sent to us from California. Gabler never met William Gabler and only became aware of William's tape-cutting when Gabler was notified by the tape-cutting facility.
