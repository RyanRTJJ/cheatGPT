 to lack such flexibility, and therefore develop as infants (5), with limited ability to develop immunity to and control of the pathogenic virus, though some studies indicate that preadolescents' ability to sense that they are being exposed to a virus is compromised at about age 14 (6). Adults, on the other hand, have a "natural" ability to detect and respond to the infectious agent, but as adults they often have to do so alone (7).


The immune system is a complex system that requires both specific antibody and specific antigen to combat invading agents. In vivo, human immunodeficiency virus appears to have only two specific antibodies capable of neutralizing the antigen of the influenza virus: IL-4 and IL-18. Antigenic antibodies are often generated via injection from a single antigen, or from various parts of the animal, such as the eye or the nose or from a small amount of a protein (e.g., granulocyte colony stimulating factor) isolated from the saliva, or from a sample of the mucus of the mouth or nose. A small amount of a virus called influenza virus inactivated by an anti-HPV protein can stimulate the body to produce a large number of specific antibodies, which, while providing effective protection, can actually enhance infection for a limited time period. Thus, although the capacity of the immune system to recognize and neutralize influenza viruses is not completely unique
