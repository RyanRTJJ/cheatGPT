 Latino, and some described it as a "black rock" area. It certainly served that purpose. It also served a much different purpose in the 1980s, when hip-hop began to take over. A black girl named Jennifer Lawrence's role as the white girl in this hip-hop movie has been a topic of much discussion. In 1999, The Warehouse's owner, Rick Haffner, began his own music venues.


As well, there were countless "lounge" clubs in Chicago back then. Many of them held their nights in the "back room," a small room above a bar on the floor right in the middle of the dance floor. Those rooms, of course, had no doors. There were plenty of bars, too, that held a lot of peopleâ€”not in the back of the bar, but elsewhere on the floor. In those days, the concept of the bar was as important as the music: There was no such thing as a "party" place in Chicago. It was not so much about a night out as it was about getting laid. You had to be in the mood for something. Back then, the "party" was always about fucking, as in "I'll show you some freaky shit." There was little of the "craze" or "cool" that existed nowadays.
