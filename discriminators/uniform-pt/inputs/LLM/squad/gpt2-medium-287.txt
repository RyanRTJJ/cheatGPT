 and honor of the deceased, not simply by a recreating of the image. As one might well assume, as more and more statues of monks and martyrs began to feature prominently, so too did the desire to honor them and respect their memory. Thus the court produced statues, mausoleums, memorials and monuments for the martyrs as well as for other prominent individuals who had made a life of God. The Church of St. Francis of Assisi in Rome produced marble statues for saints and martyrs. The Monastery of St. John of the Cross in Chianti produced frescoes for a very limited time in the 1500s. And there was Saint Pacheco, founder of the Franciscan Order, who constructed monuments and sculptures for a small number of bishopsâ€”and in doing so created his own canon. As a result of these endeavors to honor an individual's death and make them the center of society, we need only look to our own Church today.
