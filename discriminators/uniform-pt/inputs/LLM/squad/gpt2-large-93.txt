 as to whether the Ashkenazi share certain genetic traits. The findings were that Ashkenazi populations have small populations of mitochondrial DNA in parts where no non-Ashkenazi populations have any mitochondrial DNA. This is apparently a result of the genetic differences between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi populations, with the Ashkenazi having a smaller genetic component than people outside those communities.

How does this affect the question of racial science and its history? I want to start with three points. First, the point of origin of our common ancestry might not be Ashkenazi. Second, our origin does indeed involve significant genetic differences and might not be in Ashkenazi. And third, the question of whether Ashkenazi have little or no common ancestry has little to do with genetic differences and much less to do with ancestry.

Why are people always asking "Where did you come from?" or "Where does your ancestry come from?" When I make such inquiries my own first reaction is that racial science is about ancestry. That is, I want my ancestors' genetic history, their history of migration or exchange with other peoples. In the Ashkenazi case, it could turn out that I know very little—nothing at all—about my ancestors' ancestry.

But the first concern—that Ashkenazi may have little or no inherited historical continuity—is one that I think is much less likely. This is not just because the Ashkenazi have, at most, the fewest descendants who have ever been sampled in North America. Rather, this is another consequence of the genetic distance that we are said to have: Ashkenazi have
