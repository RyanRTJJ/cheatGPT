 two deals totalling £1.27 billion, with Sky making four years from each deal. It went on:

£1 million from the Sky sponsorship deal was paid up in 1992 and 1993

£300 million from Sky's sponsorship contract (the Sky Cup was introduced in 2002) in 2001–02 to raise £2 million a year

£150 million from Sky's sponsorship and TV rights deals for 1993–95

£600 million for Sky's broadcasting and production rights for 1993–94

£1.1 million annually thereafter to continue Sky's sponsorship deal

At £60 million a season, that's about $150 annually today.

After the deal, the most Sky TV rights it ever received amounted to £2.55 billion, with a total value of £26 billion.

Sky took a number of different approaches at different seasons. There was the "Sky" approach for commercial TV, which was the traditional approach for TV rights. The TV TV deal at present, and also the new deal in 2006, can only be described as Sky TV. At £4.85 billion, Sky TV is the fourth largest TV licence in the world, behind ITV and BT, and up there with Apple and Fox TV (both of whom charge a similar licensing fee for the rights they get).

The second approach, now more generally known as "broadcasting rights," is how broadcasters and pay-television companies obtain those television rights based on how many people have subscriptions to the broadcast channel who pay to be able to watch it. Those subscriptions come from people who are part of the wider programme market, such as people of every age, sex and age group. These people buy or stream shows in television sets (broadcast boxes), because they find TV TV compelling and the channel appealing.
