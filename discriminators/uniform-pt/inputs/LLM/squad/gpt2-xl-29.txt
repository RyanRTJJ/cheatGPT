The epistemological role of knowledge is to enable the person who possesses it to determine that the world, and its objects, exist; and in so doing, it is to determine how those who know it will act towards those in need of it. Since we often lack both knowledge of what we lack and the power to change what we lack, epistemic ignorance (in Popper's sense) is most closely associated with epistemic irrationalism.

Popper rejected an intrinsic view of what truth is. Truth is not merely whatever is universally accepted, but is in fact "properly adequate and true at a special kind of place and at such a time".
