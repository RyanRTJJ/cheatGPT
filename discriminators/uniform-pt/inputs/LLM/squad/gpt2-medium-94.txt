et, one of the great architects of France's 20th century. Duchamp-Villonet originally lived in Paris and was a popular painter and sculptor whose works have been found at many Paris museums. Duchamp-Villonet also created other pieces of sculpture at the Salon d'Automne through his friends, the famous sculptor Eugène Le Pré at the Salon d'Automne and Jean-Jacques Aignan at the Salon d'Automne. It is the sculpted face of a lion with a pair of horns and wings that creates the illusion of a small room or apartment, filled with natural light filtered through elaborate arches.

In 1913 Duchamp-Villonet took over the design work that a member of the design collective of the Paris Salon d'Automne created, giving the painting a full European cast. In 1915 he joined the new exhibition "Gentleman of the Universe" at the Paris Salon d'Automne, drawing with the famous and influential artist Michelangelo Rubismo, and for the next five years contributed to the large art show that followed. A collection of sculptures and paintings by Rubismo, including the Venus with a Heart sculpture, was found at the end of that time.

The last Duchamp-Villonet made work for the Salon d'Automne was December 4, 1882, and "Anastasia" was his most popular piece, exhibiting at the Salon d'Automne from December 9 through May 1. The show was not really well received in Paris and by the end of 1882 Duchamp-Villonet had become a mere spectator and did not contribute much. By that time, a new exhibition of paintings by Rubismo was taking place, and even though at that time most of the works that Duchamp-Villonet created were for his new art gallery, "Elle" at the Saint Germain museum in Paris, but "Gentleman of the Universe," "The Lion with the Hooves," "Dress to Kill" and "Woman of Destiny" continued to fill the Salon d'Automne until after the war. The museum finally closed in 1935.
