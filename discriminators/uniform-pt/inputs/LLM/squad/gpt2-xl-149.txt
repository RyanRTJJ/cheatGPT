During his filming of Commando in Europe, Arnold ran into Arnold Sch√∂nberg, who was working on an earlier version of the film's script. "I met him the first time when I was shooting," he said in 2006. "I didn't even know who he was, but I really liked his ideas and his way of working." Schwarzenegger was a producer of both films.

Schwarzenegger said in 1977 that he had his first encounter with Scientology after he was hired to play the villain in Total Recall. "They tried to get me to sign up for Dianetics at the time of shooting and I refused," he said. "I had never been interested in religion either."

Duvall also appeared in the 1987 film Commando, as did his co-star Ronny Cox, who played Arnold's brother, who also appeared in the film. In
