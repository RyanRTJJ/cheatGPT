Catholics had many advantages in this contest since Pope Damasus IV (1297-1304) had proclaimed Catholicism to be the faith of the Church. In addition, in the 13th century, Protestants were more active in the cultural debate between the Roman and Germanic cultures. Many Protestant scholars, and even the famous Catholic theologian and philosopher Gregory of Tours had written in defense of Catholic beliefs. In his famous Letter to the Emperor, Gregory argued that Catholics and Protestants had many elements in common and therefore were a compatible religion. Other Protestant theologians, like Erasmus (1100-1155), and others, as well as many theologians from more popular Protestant sects, strongly attacked Protestant theology as heretical. Protestant churches were often the homes of theologians and scholars who argued against religious orthodoxy.

For a time Protestantism was the undisputed leader of Europe and in this political environment people felt an interest in the religious side of the conflict between the two major religions in the United Kingdom.
