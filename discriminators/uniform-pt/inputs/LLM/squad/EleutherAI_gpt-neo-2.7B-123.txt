). In our work involving emotional labor, it has been useful to explore how social categories like gender and race may also be important factors for different groups.

In a series of three national studies conducted among Asian American women in Los Angeles, we used an ethnographic method to better understand and explore different cultural identities, including ethnic (Caucasian or African American), generational, generational, and linguistic. One notable finding was that feelings of shame or embarrassed were more prominent among African American women in the Asian American context compared to their Caucasian counterparts. However, as Asian women are often referred to by other women of different ethnic backgrounds as Asian, we often use the terms Asian American or Asian inclusively to refer to women from multiple ethnic origins.

We also explored the role that ethnicity-specific labels played in the perception of emotions among different cultural groups. In the case of gender-based identities, we found that women of Chinese or Japanese origin were often referred to by others in their own culture as women of a certain gender identity (e.g., a Chinese woman would be described as female-inclusive). Conversely, women of mixed ethnicity (Caucasian and/or Asian) were often referred to as non-cisgender, with one particular case illustrating how others identified Asian or Chinese women as “men” based on their gender markers. Women of African American origin were sometimes described as “African American non-inclusively” by others.

While these results and the ethnography method may suggest that non-traditional social
