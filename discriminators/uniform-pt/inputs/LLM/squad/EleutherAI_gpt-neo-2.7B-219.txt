 fashion line, would earn her a mere four million bucks. Forbes writer John Carrano noted, "After nearly 20 years in the spotlight, we haven't heard the last word."

The Forbes report was an interesting and telling measure of just how far the entertainment industry has come in just the last five years. For one, the number of people paying for tickets to concerts (or attending them as a guest) has risen precipitously—a dramatic and necessary change if you're not to drive them out; a clear indication of what is possible when an industry is not solely for the people who've already been there for all their lives or in the industry's case, have access to the latest fashions, accessories and movies.

The bottom line: when you're at the front of the pack with the ability produce and distribute music, the fashionistas and fans will follow. As it happens, in 2011, Forbes calculated the income that Beyoncé did make for her work in concert, on tour and in movies while only accounting for her songs, tours and movies—in other words, not her clothing and accessories line (all of which are now worth several million more on their own, a testament to the fact that they were more than just songs). Here's what the magazine had to say:

In 2011, $80 million made just from Beyoncé's work as an artist (songs, videos, concerts, etc) and on the road took up the first $100 million of her annual music income, and she has yet to sign new deal contracts… Her salary from 2011 to 2012 probably puts her in the top 10 highest paid female artists of all time; although at one time in her career, Beyonce made more than $100 million a year, and it still doesn’t take the shekels to live in Brooklyn.
