 might be the result of hair and skin color within a species, and light-dark coloration of the whole hair body. In mammals, the term "mammalian coloration" refers specifically to the color of the hair (and thus color change on the organism as a whole), and in bird populations the term uses color variations to group animals that are separated by geographic distances. It is the function of the melanin pigment in the white skin of a male bird that distinguishes individuals from a general population. Although many species use this term to describe a population, most species and many bird species are not only not species, but actually distinct species that belong to just the particular family of birds in which the species occurs. The term melanism, derived by the French naturalist, Claude de la Perouse, is generally used at this point in the discussion of color variation.

Melanism describes species that are not species but only very distant relatives of the species themselves but possess different morphological, biochemical, phenotypic and physiological phenotypes. The majority of species are descended from only one member of a particular family, so that, for example, in birds, more than one member from the same family may have melanism. Melanism is sometimes described as a mutation in the color change of the hair or skin. In other species, many individuals will have this same color variation, but at the same time lose the melanin pigment, which gives rise to two different colored hair or skin. Such species may also have a mutation in the melanosomes, in which color is stored in a pigment-rich structure rather than in a substance-poor structure. The most widespread mutation in the hair or skin
