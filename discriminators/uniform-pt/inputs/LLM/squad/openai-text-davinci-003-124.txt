imate change is making ecosystems more vulnerable to invasions. Additionally, as humans alter or destroy habitats, they create new opportunities for invasions.

Increasing globalization and the expansion of global trade has also been implicated as a major cause of the increase in species invasions. The transport of goods, soil, plants, and animals worldwide on ships, planes, and other vehicles has greatly increased the number of species being moved around the globe. Additionally, some species have been intentionally introduced for commercial and recreational purposes, such as for farming, aquaculture, and sport hunting. As these introductions occur, some species become established and spread, expanding their ranges beyond the areas where they were initially introduced.

Climate change is predicted to lead to an even greater rise in species invasions. Higher temperatures, longer growing seasons, and increased availability of water can create new opportunities for species to become invasive. However, climate change can also cause disturbances to ecosystems (such as drought, floods, and fires) that can create further opportunities for invasions. In addition, changing climatic conditions may be causing organisms to attempt to move to new areas in order to find suitable environmental conditions. All of these factors could contribute to a further increase in species invasions in the future.
