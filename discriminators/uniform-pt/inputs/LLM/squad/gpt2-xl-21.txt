 This view in contrast to Schopenhauer's view of rational agents as creatures who are at least as bound as nature is is not to be found in Hegel's mature philosophy.

What are the common views of Hegel's mature philosophy and in what is implied?

In this respect, Hegel's views on metaphysics seem more certain and self-consistent than his views on logic and metaphysics in particular. The reason is that Hegel's theories, such as the Phenomenology and the Logic, and to a lesser extent the Elements of Logic, are concerned with metaphysical issues in which one thinks of the existence of something outside of experience, something which goes beyond the things themselves. On this view, what is at stake is the nature of reality itself (an ontological conception) and the status of the thing in itself.

Although Hegel doesn't say much about this theme in particular in the Phenomenology and the Logic, his discussion of it appears in the Preface to a long work on the Idea. So if some of what Heidegger says can be read in this way, Hegel's views on the relationship between things are at least in considerable part self-consistent, in the sense that he is trying to establish the truth of metaphysics and the notion of reality's nature. This is the point at issue in the essay on Feuerbach in his Logic, and this is the reason that Hegel's view on philosophy of language as metaphysics is a form of self-consistent
