 response and we need to study the molecular bases of stress, stress response, and emotion processes.

This is exactly what the team of Joon Young Kim, PhD, and colleagues recently did using genetic profiling as the model system. The researchers used the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs397914 in the HPA axis gene to study how HPA axis gene expression differs in women who have a high score, and women with lower scores, on stress and emotionality-motivational traits.

For the study, the team measured HPA axis gene expression in female rats before and after administering either the anserine (pH 2.8) precursor, the anesthetic diphenhydramine (Diphenhydramine), or a stressor. In both cases, the researchers observed HPA axis gene expression increased and decreased with stress and increased and decreased with emotionality.

The authors then examined the relationship between HPA axis gene expression and social interactions. Male and female rats were paired with an individual that had been stressed and the researchers measured social behavior and negative emotional states.

The team also studied stress induced changes in HPA axis gene expression in the group, but in the female animals. Male, but not female rats were subjected to stress and then their HPA axis gene expression was measured. The authors found that social withdrawal, as measured by the social defeat paradigm, was the strongest stress-induced response, which supports the theory that HPA axis function is sensitive to the presence of an individual associated with stress.

In addition, the study revealed that stress resulted in HPA/pituitary axis function being enhanced and decreased with social defeat. The stress-induced changes in HPA axis function were specific to females.

"At first glance, the findings may seem counterintuitive: Females
