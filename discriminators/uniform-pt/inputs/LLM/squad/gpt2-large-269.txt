 is made up of deserts with a very thin snow cover; the snow may cover all the land, but is not usually high enough to be suitable for the farming of crops. The southern and desert regions are more suitable for agricultural purposes but the winter is generally much colder and dryer. (1) (2) In the south the desert has the most fertile land and the most fertile air in the world. (1) (2) The lowest latitude is at the south-west of the southern Sahara Desert, and is over 1500 nautical miles away. In other words, the greatest amount of productive soil is found in the south east of the Sahara. The southern deserts are only the most fertile; the south-east, the land that receives most rain and temperatures, is the most fertile, and is the part of the Sahara where agriculture needs more attention. (1) The most productive soil, on the other hand, is found to north of 3000 nautical miles, or the dry-down and southern half of the Sahara. (1) Southward of this, the dry-down and southern half of the Sahara is an arid and sandy place, the arid part of this being the fertile portion. (1) The arid part of the west side of the Sahara is a wet and cold desert. It receives most rainfall throughout the year and the soil generally contains the most organic material. (3) In the dry-down or southern half, in comparison with the dry-down or northern half, there are not that many plants. The arid south-east is much larger and driest part of the Sahara. In the north, however, there is sufficient rainfall to irrigate crops, there is no aridity and the soil yields a much higher average of productivity. Some of the countries at the north border of the Sahara, are not only the principal centres of the production of food, but are also the leading agricultural centres of the world. It should also be remembered that this is the desert region. The arid lands of the north east of the Sahara and adjoining regions are very similar in their climate and soil to the dry zones of the south-east and north of the Sahara. (2) The northern, western
