By sending a child to school, an adult is sending the entire family into a struggling situation. Children are more likely to be taught by their mothers. Children of married parents are four times more likely to be taught by their mothers as children than children of single parents or of fathers and stepmothers combined. Research shows that this is because the mother is more likely to help them study and will allow the child more time to do homework. Therefore, an adolescent's home environment will make a real difference in how well an adolescent will do at school (Hobbie and MacDougall, 1991).

Parental financial and educational resources have a tremendous impact on an adolescent's development. Some studies show that a father with income of less than $25,000 in 1970 was more likely than a father with income of $150,000 or more to continue educating his son by age 14 (McLeod, 1996). The average earnings of fathers have risen from $14,720 in 1972 to $22,480 in 1994 (NIAA, 1994). Since 1970, the earnings of fathers who did not continue to work after the birth of their first child have declined while those of
