At that point, Schwarzenegger realized he could not divorce Barbara, although he wanted to be together with Shriver. In March 1981, after five years of marriage, he officially ended divorce proceedings with his wife of 30 years and moved on to Shriver.

One of the first movies Schwarzenegger starred in was Terminator 2: Judgment Day, and he took part in several sequels after that, including The Terminator3: Genesis, Terminator: Rise of the Machines, The Terminator 4, and Terminator: Salvation. Schwarzenegger is also active in humanitarian issues, specifically relating to global warming. He has been extremely vocal about global warming and his efforts to combat global warming. In November 2000, he created a political action committee called The Heartland Institute to promote global warming skepticism.

In February 2011, he revealed that he had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Shortly after the diagnosis, he announced the creation of his own film production company, Terminator Filmworks, to develop movies based on future technology “not just like Terminator2: Judgment Day but Terminator3 and other Terminator films”.

I grew up in Hollywood and I remember growing up thinking about what Terminator3 would be and the idea of what it could be with this technology…. This is where it started for me.”
