 and by 1921, one hundred major bridges had been built. Trains provided transportation for over 12 million Germans in the late 1800s, including over 30,000 in Berlin. Since 1936, the German railway system has been in constant development through the construction of many new trackages between Trier-Wien and Frankfurt, including Thuringia. Due to the very rapid construction of large stretches of track on these major lines, the number of lines to which were assigned to the local branch networks was relatively small. In 1923, Trängel and Wunderkammer had two branches each and since then there have been at least six branches in each of the four branches of the Türk Railroad serving Berlin, and many branches operating within the district of Neustadt-Rhein-Westfalen (Rhein-Baden-Westphalia or Berlin Rheinland-Rheinland). German railways have enjoyed their very own railroad system over the past 200 years. In 1874, the United States developed a new railroad system, using the existing Erie Canal System. Since then, many routes have developed from the Erie Canal to the newly designed Great Wall Railway (Kömschule). The German railway system is also a great example of the growth in the railroad technology that has been developed since 1842. After approximately the beginning of the 19th century, the steam age saw the development of several techniques of locomotives. This also extended to the use of rolling stock. A railroad is composed of several tracks of various width and length, all of which must move together and must provide reliable service as the trains are continually lengthened and shortened, and can produce dangerous traffic congestion.


Bildungsromanische Tränen (Bastion of the Rhine), which is also known as the Thuringian Tröhm, was the oldest German rail network established and named after a medieval fortress which
