 a carbon capture and storage standard to curb emissions from electrical and heating systems by 2022. While carbon-capture measures are common within the general public environment, the measures undertaken in the City of Melbourne, Moreland City Council in 2010, and in New York City by a number of municipalities have the potential to reach substantial reductions in emissions, both through economic and social impact. In addition, the World Bank recognizes New York City as in a position to benefit from climate change. The City of New York is implementing a new set of emission reduction standards aimed at encouraging a carbon-to-oxygen transition and reducing emissions.

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development recently reported that one of the best ways to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants is to become a cleaner and greener society. In addition, many of the goals and strategies that will help communities achieve these goals include actions on climate change and the use of transportation-friendly policies.

3.1. Emission from energy-intensive sources

The major energy source emissions are natural gas from commercial and industrial installations and natural gas from coal and natural gas from nuclear power plants.

An estimated 6% of Australian emissions are from natural gas; however, electricity generation from gas-fired plants is an energy-intensive process and is significantly more costly than power generated from other sources such as coal or nuclear power plants. However, Australia is also home to some of the highest reserves of coal in the world, accounting for 14 per cent of all energy supply.

This has been driving up the price of fossil
