can draw moreoxygen from the air, allowing them to take deeper breaths and absorb more of the available oxygen in a shorter amount of time. This helps them fly and conserve energy.

To accomplish this, bird lungs have a large number of tiny passageways that oxygen is exhaled and inhaled through. This optimizes the large surface area for gas exchange. Also, a bird’s air capillaries are arranged in a different way than a mammal’s, allowing for a more efficient transfer of oxygen from the lungs to the circulatory system. This system facilitates efficient diffusion of oxygen into the blood.

Moreover, birds are able to take advantage of air currents while they are flying. By rafting—that is, gliding forward with the assistance of the wind—birds can conserve their energy and be able to travel long distances without tiring. This process relies heavily on the efficient diffusion of oxygen into the blood. In addition, some species of birds, such as hummingbirds, can adjust their breathing rate while they are in flight so they can take in more oxygen and use it better.
