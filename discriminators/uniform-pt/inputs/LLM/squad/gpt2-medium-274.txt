 fact, according to the latest statistics by the United Nations Children's Fund, humans invaded over 4.5 million species from 2001 to 2011. These invasions have been devastating and devastating to the planet's ecosystems.

The biggest threat to Earth's ecosystems can be seen in China, whose population doubled between 2010 and 2012. According to the UN, China's total population increased by 12.6 million people from 2010 to 2014, and that increases by 28.6 million people by 2050. This includes the over 7 million animals that are killed every year in China. Some experts believe that by 2030 there will be 4.4 billion people in China.

This increase in population, combined with pollution, agriculture and pollution of groundwater, soil, rivers and lakes, are the biggest threats to the world's aquatic ecosystem. As the WWF explains:

Invasive species have destroyed habitats, removed food and water sources, threatened biodiversity and may lead to extinction of native species such as the Australian grey parrot found in the waters off southern Tasmania.

Some of the largest threats in Asia are also seen in the wild. In many cases, the illegal harvesting and trade of insects, vertebrates, species from rivers and marine ecosystems, and livestock is the main cause of the problem. In one study conducted by UNICEF in Indonesia, a major portion of the world's total biodiversity is controlled by illegal wildlife trade and illegal farming.

We must stop illegal wildlife trade. It's the most destructive form of
