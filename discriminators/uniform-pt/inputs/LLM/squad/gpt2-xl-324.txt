 of a prey species starts to shrink. In the case of a leopard, an animal that was once widely distributed across the world's high deserts, the leopard population has been reduced to an estimated 4â€“5 individuals in many parts of India. Over a period of ten years, these prey have slowly and slowly been pushed farther into the surrounding areas.

Loss of habitat, such as waterholes or rocky ridges, and changes in the prey's food resource, such as climate change affects populations of the prey species. When such a predator no longer has the food in areas where they have lived, their populations will decrease. Similarly, as a species population decreases, it will be less able to respond to climate changing.

But when a predator is considered a keystone species, the population of animals and ecosystem services it provides will be impacted as a result. The results of that assessment is often in the form of a protected area, which is created because a predator is deemed critical to a system. The conservation of these keystone species is an important component in how we manage ecosystems, as well as our overall conservation efforts.

Leopards as Lion Conservationists

There are many examples of leopards doing conservation work. As lions that live in areas where lions once roamed, they can help conserve species such as the Orangutan, Bengal Tigers, and African Javan Rhinoceros. The lion is considered a keystone species in South Asia and the Indian subcontinent, but in Pakistan and Bangladesh, leopards are considered "species of special concern."

Though leopards live across Asia, it is primarily in Pakistan and Bangladesh that human populations will increasingly be concerned if the wild leopards go extinct.

Leopards have long been considered one of
