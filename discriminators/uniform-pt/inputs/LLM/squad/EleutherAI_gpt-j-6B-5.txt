 that will qualify for a match to be cancelled are when the rule breaches are committed by the opponent. The referee may disqualify the player if the referee deems a penalty is merited for a particular rule infraction.

A player must comply with a referee’s decision (within their power to enforce)

Any player who deliberately disobeys a referee’s directive has committed a penalty; this would include deliberately not responding to a referee’s calls, or purposely leaving the scoring area when a referee has flagged and called the opponent out of bounds. The player is sent off, and the ref can throw a red card at the offending player, or remove the player from the match with a red or yellow card, depending on the seriousness of the violation. A red card means 10-15 minutes of stoppage is added to the match, and a yellow card means that the player must leave the scoring area and the match be replayed from the restart. If a player is removed, the opposing team must replace him with a substitute.

If a player is unable to be identified or there is no substitute player on the field at the restart of play, the player is deemed to be unavailable and the match is cancelled. However, the match need not be replayed if a player, after the restart, returns to the scoring area.

The referee has some judgement which affects the game, and, unlike players, referees do not have to abide by the rules
