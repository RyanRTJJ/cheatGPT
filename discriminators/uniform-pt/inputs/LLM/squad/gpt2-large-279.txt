a device which brought the current back into a current-carrying arm where it collected the electric power). A large number of trams, of each type, were made by the Dublin & Limerick Railway Company between 1898 as well as by tram companies elsewhere.

Fig. 6. The power supply line (left) used to charge electric trams at a tram station. The line was supplied by a pair of power supply transformers, mounted on large poles, which were mounted on the roof of a tower house. The poles were made of a heavy wrought iron (steel) steel (Fig. 6). The lines were generally of four to six miles length and were fed from a single'street' to a single 'tram' station located at a tram track. The trunk line was fed through a conduit which had to be'switched' from one station to the other before it could be recharged. The main conduit was a steel iron plate (tetrahedron). In some cases, the main conduit was a conduit or a metal duct. The conduit would have passed under the bridge on the north side of the city, with the first three trams (light) coming over the bridge and the four trams (dark) coming over the bridge to Dublin's tram-sheds. When a pair of the light trams went over the bridge, the light trams stopped and the dark trams re-mounted on the pole. Once one pair of trams went over the bridge, the second pair went over to the 'yard' station, then the third pair went to the yard, the fourth pair would get off onto the yard and the fifth and last pair (dark) would follow the 'traffic' off to the yard. This arrangement was the one which
