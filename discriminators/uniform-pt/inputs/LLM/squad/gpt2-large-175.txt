 of the disease.

Diagnosis of malaria is based on clinical manifestations (e.g., a marked erythema migrans (EMA) and a rash), which is the most accurate method for the detection of malaria in humans. EMA or rash is frequently the main clinical sign of malaria.

The diagnosis of malaria can be verified by positive or negative skin prick tests, by using other types of blood tests, including a serum or plasma-based assay for malaria, and by means of a blood test for antimalarial antibodies. The presence of malaria in a person is also confirmed by the presence of a parasite being in the blood of the person, the presence of a protoporphyrin stain on the upper eyelid or on the cutaneous surface of the skin, and by visual examination. The presence of blood and/or body fluids in the nasopharyngeal passage is also confirmed by negative serology.

Clinical manifestations

The first clinical signs of blood or body fluid in the nostrils should be an erythema migrans on the upper and lower surface of the eyelids (which is usually severe and lasts for at least 10 minutes) due to the presence of an infectious agent. Signs are the same as for any other symptoms of malaria: nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

Diagnostic methods

An individual should be diagnosed by a health professional to whom he or she is medically obligated to bring any of the following samples: chest X-ray, a blood test for malaria, a serum test for antibodies to parasite, a skin test for
