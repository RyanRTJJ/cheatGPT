 all observable phenomena in terms of that data. His work made a huge difference in what we know about the universe. Even a simple example of this—where we are asked to model a particle's spin using the coordinates of its magnetic moment and that of other particles—has enormous importance because we now know that we can solve our own problems and discover new phenomena by modelling our interactions.

In order to understand what Feynman's contribution was to the field of particle physics, one needs to appreciate a bit about the physics behind the diagrams that represent his hypothetical particles. Let's start with the simplest case—not the most accurate, for any theory of particle physics can be improved upon in one way or another—he was trying to model something like an electron with seven (yes: seven!) "quarks", each in the state of one of four magnetic moment states, where spin can be thought of as an attribute of the quarks. Those quarks have a large number of different "states", and when you try to measure the individual components of a quark, what you do is take the energy which defines a quark and add it to the energy of each of the other components of that quark. This way, while you're measuring the energy of each of the quarks together, you are also measuring the energy of each of each of the other four quarks, and adding that together. How long that takes to end up with a single stable composite quark is determined by the
