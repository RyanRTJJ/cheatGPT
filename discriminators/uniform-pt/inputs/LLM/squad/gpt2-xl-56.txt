 comprise less than 5% of the total.

There is, however, a great deal of diversity within a specific Jewish population, and one may be led to believe that any Jewish lineage can appear on any Jewish tree as long as it is within the Jewish community. To understand the magnitude of this diversity, consider a Jewish population, say the Ashkenazic Jews, who, for instance, have three "races" of male ancestors represented, based on modern and ancient Ashkenazi Jewish surnames: Sephardim, Mizrahim, and Ashkenazim with Sephardic given names and Ashkenazim given surnames. The ancestry of any two Ashkenazi Jews is, of course, very different. However, a modern Ashkenazi Jew, without knowing the Jewish ancestry of one of his male ancestors, might infer that of the Ashkenazi Jews in his home town, all his distant ancestors, and thus all his cousins, are of Jewish ancestryâ€”an assumption in its own right.

In fact, almost any two Ashkenazi Jews within a city may not be aware of the ancestry of their other distant relatives; or to their embarrassment, one of the other Jewish cousins may be unaware of his own Jewish ancestry. This is a great, and rather familiar example of a "race" in which ancestry does not tend to be very reliable.

So how can one determine whether someone's Jewish ancestry is from one Jewish
