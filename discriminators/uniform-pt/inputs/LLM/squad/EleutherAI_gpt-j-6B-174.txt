 around AD 280, however, it became increasingly popular to claim that Mary too was saved. In one popular late fourth-century text the writer of Ecclesiastical History ascribes the doctrine to the third-century bishop Alexander of Constantinople; in another, he attributes it to the fourth-century bishop Theodoret who reportedly had his own experience with the Holy Trinity. For many in the Latin Church, the doctrine held no interest, but as a reflection of the triumphalist thinking in the Greek East it became quite a popular way to express belief in the complete redemption of Mary and the salvation of the human race. It was not without good reason: at the time of Augustine, as we will see below, there were few alternatives that adequately conveyed to laypersons the doctrine, especially in the context of the newly adopted Donatism. Nonetheless, the doctrine was extremely controversial, was quickly denounced as a heretic innovation in Roman synods, and was even accused of actually causing the Fall of mankind.

There were few alternatives that adequately conveyed to lay Christians in the fourth century the doctrine of Mary's absolute sinlessness and the salvation of Jesus' sinful humanity. (Art Gallery Collection/Corbis)
