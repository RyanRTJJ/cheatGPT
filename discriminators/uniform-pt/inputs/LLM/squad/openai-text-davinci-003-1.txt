 Sad Agreement, which proposed standardized Serbo-Croat language, considering the two existing variants of the language (Shtokavian being the main one) as variants of the same language.

The Novi Sad Agreement was a diplomatic document signed in 1954 by a group of linguists and writers from Serbia and Croatia. The agreement sought to create a unified version of the Serbo-Croatian language, based on the Shtokavian dialect of Serbo-Croatian. The agreement was endorsed by Matica Srpska, the cultural and scientific institution of Serbia, and Matica Hrvatska, the cultural and scientific institution of Croatia. It proposed that these two institutions cooperate in creating a unified language, because they understood that while they had different regional variants, they still belonged to the same language family. The agreement was a strong source of inspiration for regional cooperation between Serbia and Croatia and a testament to the importance of language in understanding one another at the time. Since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Serbo-Croatian has split into two separate languages, Serbian and Croatian.
