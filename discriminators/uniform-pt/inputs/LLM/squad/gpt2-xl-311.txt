 right on the middle line for average cold temperatures in Boston between the years 2000 and 2015. This is also consistent with the −3 °C coldest month value the city has reported since 2007. Using the −3 °C midmonth value and converting to "days" using the BED 5.0 climate models, Boston's December mean temperature of 14.6 °C in 2015 is the coldest on record for the city and the 5th most cold across the country (the other two coldest are Salem, Oregon (20.1 °C in December 2015) and Buffalo, New York (15.9 °C in December 2015).[17]

Historical Climate and Temperature Anomalies for Boston [ edit ]

Tropical winter average in Boston and the surrounding suburbs (1935–2015) for the GISS 5th and 1st versions, and for the UAH dataset

Note: Temperature anomalies refer to anomalies relative to the 1961–1990 average. The black line represents 1% of the 1901–2000 range; the grey line represents 1% of the 1950–1979 range with a linear regression approach. Data from BED 5.0 were used in generating this plot, but it should not be treated as final climate projections or long-term averages; this is only used here to demonstrate trend patterns. Data were extracted from the NASA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) TEMPS database. The BED temperature model was calculated using the same formula as by TAR1.0.5 [18] (p. 10) using the same data, except BED 5.0 was used. The BED 5.0 method has been revised in [19] (p. 2), correcting the NCDC record and correcting the NOAA data for the missing land areas of the US, using a higher and more accurate time period than before, from 1979 through 2011. The original model used a fixed trend for the period from 1979 to 1985 and a linear trend (with
