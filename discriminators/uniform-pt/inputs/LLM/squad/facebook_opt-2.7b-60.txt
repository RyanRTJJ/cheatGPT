 more susceptible to antigen challenge and are more sensitive to antigen than adults.

This study will analyze the effect of maternal antibodies on infant and parental immune responses to antigen in infants born to women with low or moderate response to pregnancy immunization.

This study is designed to determine the effect of maternal antibodies on infant and parental immune responses to food antigen in infants born to women with low or moderate response to pregnancy immunization.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies, present in women who are HIV positive in the current study, could be used as a measure of maternal immune status, to identify HIV infection, and to determine the effect of immunization during pregnancy on infant, maternal and fetal immune responses to HIV when infected with HIV in the future.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies, present in women who are HIV positive in this study, could be used as a measure of maternal immune status, to identify HIV infection and the effects of immunization during pregnancy on infant and maternal immune responses.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether there is a potential for maternal viral load to control infant and maternal immunity to influenza. Infants of HIV-negative mothers whose mother receives H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine during pregnancy will be studied.

This study will evaluate
