 its leading high schools, with controversial president John F. Kennedy.

Yale officials decided to resign after that scandal, according to the school's president, a move he denied during a recent meeting with students.

But Yale officials told students in a series of interviews that they did not feel safe in that position â€” a conclusion that led them to resign on March 2.

Last year, students at Calhoun College in Hartford were singled out because of their sexual orientation. Although it was not their university's goal, an official at Yale who spoke on the condition of anonymity said, "We don't want any members of the student body who may object to that. It's not a situation that we think we have to live with that way."

The Yale administration also changed course on how to better combat gender bias in admissions. In November, it launched a new rule that would eliminate quotas for female applicants for higher education under Title IX, which includes all gender-affirming sexual orientations.

The change did not affect women at Yale. Instead, the policy was changed to remove discrimination based on gender. The changes did not prevent gender discrimination in the admissions process. Yale received no such change in the fall. But Yale officials are expected to review the changes in the fall.

School shootings

In recent years, incidents of gun violence have become a major public issue.

In each of those shootings, there was no indication of any sexual misconduct at the time, but there are troubling reports of school shootings.

A new law in New York and elsewhere last fall requires colleges' public safety advisers to report and respond to shootings related to LGBT diversity.

In 2007, the New York Police Commissioner made the case that it is important not to allow "the notion of an 'all male' school system
