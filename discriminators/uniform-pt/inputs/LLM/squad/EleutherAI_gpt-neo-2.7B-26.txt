 it was made by Paramount Pictures or Walt Disney Co. as well as Warner Bros. and United Artists (United Artists was also at one point MCA's arch enemy). The company would later use these companies as marketing divisions on many of its productions. Although MCA would use many well known companies the next decade they never signed anything as significant as an actual contract to any company or person until after United Artists in 1976. 

In the 1980s, MCA started to increase the scope of the disc jockeys they were manufacturing. They had many of them produce music and jingles for them. The first of these was Kenny Smith (born in 1936)who would go on to be the first R&B disc jockey in the country in the early 1970s when he became the first disc jockey who used an FM transmitter, and the first disc jockey to use an FM transmitter in 1970. He has worked with the likes of Smokey Robinson, Al Green, The Temptations, and others, making some of the first of their jingles. Around the same time, the first woman ever employed in the MCA record label, Joan Marie (Joelle) McBride, produced the first R&B single to be produced by the label when she did the vocals on "Be Careful What You Say". This single would take the number 1 position on the Billboard R&B singles chart
