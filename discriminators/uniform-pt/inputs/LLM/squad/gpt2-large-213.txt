In the early 1700s, two people were hired by the Prince of Wales as administrators of the church. Robert Wood, a minister, took over the church from the previous religious administrator, a Methodist named William Price. Wood and Price quickly built up the cemetery and built a grand hall on the grounds. On February 3rd, 1703, the Prince of Wales awarded the church to Pennsylvania and Philadelphia. The church was given a new, larger, and better-appointed building by the Prince, named St. Stephen, after the most devout man in the church, which had to be replaced after he died.

Although many buildings on the grounds were built in different styles, Bethlehem went through a general renovation in the 1660s and after the 1701 Revolution and the American Revolution. With the destruction of the Dutch-owned town of New Amsterdam, the town has been held until the present day.
