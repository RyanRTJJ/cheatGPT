 by the British in 1801.

In 1588, the English granted Jamaica a charter. But the colony was quickly overtaken by the British as Spain's forces fought for control. One of the main reasons it remained in Spanish hands was because there was a substantial Spanish contingent in Jamaica (known as "the Spanish Armada").


In 1590, King James I of England granted Jamaicans the right to vote by parliament and to own property as a condition of holding English citizenship. King James' mother, Queen Elizabeth, also granted them the right to inherit from her. The Spanish Armada, which ruled until the Spanish-American War ended in 1898, captured Jamaica on Nov. 1, 1584. The Armada also ravaged nearby Cuba in the Caribbean Sea (see History: Barbados).

Britain was forced to withdraw from the island and take Spanish colonies. In 1661, Spain began seizing control of Caribbean Islands such as Barbados (see "Spain Takes Puerto Rico"), St. Kitts and Nevis, and Grenada. In 1711, a British expedition seized the capital of Jamaica and forced its inhabitants to leave. In 1729, the British established Jamaica as a colony as part of the British Empire, with the island later annexed to Great Britain. When the British left, Jamaica became a British dependency. Since then, in 1613, the British gave the island "a free disposition," but left it under constant British control.
