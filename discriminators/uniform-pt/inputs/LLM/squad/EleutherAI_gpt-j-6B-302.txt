 yards (97 m) apart. The field is surrounded at its perimeter with a wooden fence. The official Canadian Football League (CFL) rulebook stipulates that, regardless of the surface type (natural grass, artificial turf, cinder, etc.)  the number of lines of scrimmage are three: a "Red" line behind the offensive blue line that represents the "end", a "White" line behind the offensive red line that represents the "point", and a "Blue" line behind the defensive "Red" line that represents the "line of scrimmage".

In the CFL, the line of scrimmage for a defensive team is defended by three linemen in an open backfield formation (a five-man defensive line) and one linebacker while an offensive team may carry seven players on the  offence, a five-man offensive line and two defensive backs (a five-receiver formation) â€“ an eight-man formation.[1] On each team there are four "down linemen": the linemen closest to the line of scrimmage and three linemen who, in combination with the offensive and defensive linemen, form the middle blocking section (i.e. all but one lineman of the middle three sections are defensive linemen). The eight-man formation (three down linemen, four additional linemen) is considered especially effective in the CFL because of the large space that it affords and because it is the only formation that can completely deny the offense the outside running lanes that running backs prefer, in which down backs would be isolated and would not have a safety cushion.

Because teams usually carry multiple running backs, linemen must be able to run block down their back fields and sometimes double team their opponents, requiring them to switch to a running stance. These running backs also receive carries in the running game, especially in the CFL; however, they are generally used for pass protection only, as there is a lack of skilled receivers in Canadian
