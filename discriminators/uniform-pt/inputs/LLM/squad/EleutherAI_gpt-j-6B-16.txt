 activities of the autonomic nervous system. Many researchers have found strong linkages with depression and the parasympathetic nervous system; many researchers believe that the parasympathetic nervous system tends to inhibit stress and regulate emotions (Schubert, 2011). There is also substantial evidence that anxiety and the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis respond more intensely in the presence of perceived danger and high levels of arousal, regardless of the environment, than when calm and relaxed. Such findings link emotions with the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (Schubert, 2011). Emotions may also inhibit or encourage physiological processes, such as arousal, digestion or immune system function, among many others.
