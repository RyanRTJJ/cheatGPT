 of predators is in fact higher than the population of prey. The reason for this is that a predator takes the place of the prey so that it no longer has to search for food. Hence, a population of predators results in a higher population of the prey. This population increase in the population of predators often makes up for a temporary reduction in the total population of both predators and prey. Over many generations time, the predator population may equal the prey population.

If the human's population continued to increase at the rate it has over the past few years it would soon overtake the populations of all wild animals. Because of the increase of population of humans over the past few years, wild animals now find the predators of humans to have much more competition than for themselves. Although, the competition for resources may be severe to the animal life on Earth, it can be seen that many animals would be more successful in their lifestyle of competition as long as they survived.

Wild animals compete to survive and these animals would be just as successful today if they lived much of their life as a prey. In fact, wild animals would be more successful competing with wild predator populations if they were not prey any longer. The more prey there were, the more the population of predators would be at a larger size. Many animals would be successful and survive in their competition. However, a smaller percentage of species would survive as predators while the larger percentage would be successful in their competition.

The most important reason for this, would be the population of prey. The population of prey is what determines the
