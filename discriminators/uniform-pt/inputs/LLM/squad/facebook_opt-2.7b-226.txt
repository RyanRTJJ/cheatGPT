 in a book, a film, or a speech. If we can explore the history of literature we can get closer to understanding its relevance in today’s culture, which at the very least can help us appreciate its unique position in American history. This book, edited by the University of Virginia Press, offers a wealth of scholarship on this question, with its theme of The History of Literature as an Organ of Change. The volume is divided into four sections: Essays; Comparative Literature; and Biographical Studies. The focus is on how Western literature came to be a uniquely American expression, and on the ways that literature has shaped culture, politics, and intellectual thinking since the eighteenth-century.

The essays in this section focus on a wide range of topics, from literature of the revolution, to literary genres of the modern age, to the ways in which writers were able to reflect about what they saw. The focus is on American literature across its period, from colonial poetry to modern “serious” and “popular” fiction. While many of these sections focus on historical issues of literary production during different, earlier periods, all contribute in new and interesting ways to the broader dialogue about the ways in which American literature emerged and evolved.

The fourth section of the anthology covers the topic of authors and their lives, from Charles Kingsley to James Baldwin. Biographical studies include an important chapter about Robert Frost from one of his most prolific biographers (George Brant), and a look back at literature and slavery through a study of one of the most important American authors of the nineteenth century, Edmond Douglas. In addition to examining authors, the book offers an interesting look at the intersection of literature and American culture, as well as the relationship between American literature and the idea of America.

Overall, this book comes across as timely and useful in the current discussions about the role that literature can play in American culture. It offers a broad introduction to this subject
