In the 1990s and early 2000s, economic problems in Libya intensified. Libyan exports were down to less than $10 billion a year, down from $200 million to $100 million a year, and from $100 million to $150 million a year. Libya's exports rose by an average of 17 percent a year in 2007 to $16.8 billion, according to the European Union's Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That has helped to bring inflation to 12 percent and food rationing to 6 percent.

But while Libya has avoided economic stagnation and has gained a sense of stability, many of the same issues faced by the West over the last dozen years have become a barrier to its growth. The economy as a whole now looks like it could grow at most 2 percent or even 3 percent this year.

The economy has shown "crisp recovery" over the last 10 years, according to the International Monetary Fund. But the economy in Libya has already fallen well short of its previous peak in the late 1990s, when it grew 4 percent a year. Those trends seem to be receding as Libya's economic prospects look much better.

As for the rise in imports, Libya is at a disadvantage because the country has cut back on its production.

In 2004, Libya had a deficit of only 4.1 percent of GDP. By 2009, it had grown to $32.6 billion. Under Obama's economic growth plan, the U.S. and the EU must increase production to a level that meets a 50 percent share target by 2015, according to the Treasury Department.
