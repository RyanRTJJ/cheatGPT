The Daily Northwestern publishes on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Fridays. Daily Opinion is directed entirely by undergraduates. Editorials published on their opinion web page feature a large variety of views (see the columns in each section).

The Daily Northwestern is a forum for the student government to discuss policy. The university does not publish its own policy paper. Students write their own, and are encouraged to do so at their own pace.

Student Government Journal

The Daily Northwestern is a publication for student governing bodies. It publishes several opinion pieces, with a focus on campus activism.

The Daily Northwestern Editorial Board (DNC) comprises five faculty advisors: a former professor who works in the Department of Sociology and Sociology, a former professor working in the Department of Human Geography, a former professor working in the Department of Anthropology (one of the field's more highly rated universities), and a former professor working in Law. The editorial board is consulted regularly by the Daily Northwestern staff on a wide array of issues for which they have published.

Editorial Board

The Daily Northwestern is administered by six full-time part-time editors and a news and editor. The editorial board meets weekly to select its editor, with input from other faculty. All editors are members of the Board of Visitors.
