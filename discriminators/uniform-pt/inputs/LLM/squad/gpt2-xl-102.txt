As many black slaves who migrated to the South settled down and ran their own businesses and communities, most schools were run by African Americans and whites alike.

It's difficult to determine how many black students in the Montana Territory attended the same schools as their fellow black residents in New Orleans, Louisiana, in what was called "the free school segregation."
