 Sasha Fierce. The performance drew attention as a display of “street style’s future and the future of the fashion industry,” as the New York Daily News declared.

As her audience danced to “Halo” and “Partition,” Beyoncé explained:

I want the world to be able to dress how I dress, not how they think I want them to dress. I love, love, love fashion, really I do, but that’s just me. And I don’t even like to label myself as a style icon, because that is what it is for a lot of people today – it doesn’t exist as much as it did. And that’s why I don’t use the term style icon, because it implies that it is something that is for everybody. There’s not really, and I’m not gonna get into all the different types of people that people are into. I like a good fit. I like how I look. I don’t really want people who are fashionable on point, I want fashionable, it’s just me.

During this show, Beyoncé wore a beaded necklace made from the “Bey-O” earrings she had worn in 2004, with the word “O” in the middle, and two black-and-gold hoops sewn around each ear. (The earrings were stolen the following week.) She said the necklace and gold rondelles made it more fashionable, and then she added, “It doesn’t mean I’m not spiritual or whatever.”

During the show, her entourage of assistants ran out on the stage to help her perform. The crew began a “sway dance” with her and asked in what way she felt comfortable. “I said: ‘I’d be super-freak out. I don’t know how to do that.’ And they went crazy,” she recalled.

The crowd responded with cheers and
