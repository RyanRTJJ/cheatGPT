 the proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, the former editor, Rebekah Brooks, and his sons and daughters, James, Jason, Frances and Chloe Murdoch and Jessica Murphy. At each subsequent trial the Crown have relied on evidence of extensive phone hacking and other crimes.

In her written opinion, Judge Patricia Leeming noted that this second trial would not only have to decide whether the defendants conspired to commit misconduct in a public office, but it must also test many other issues such as the degree of culpability of different defendants and, crucially, how to define ‘malfeasance’. This led Judge Leeming to question the need for a second trial.

Judge Leeming’s findings that the police had evidence against the defendants, despite the absence of the Crown’s evidence of their ‘knowledge or commission of any criminal offence’, led the judge to conclude that: ‘The prosecution case that the six defendants conspired to commit misconduct in a public office is not just an allegation against the defendants. It provides an appropriate remedy,’ [emphasis added]. According to Judge Leeming, the judge is bound by previous decisions that have determined that when the Crown’s evidence is lacking or ‘insufficient for trial’, the ‘prosecution case’ is not ‘just’. Instead, Judge Leeming relied on previous rulings by Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry into media ethics, a judgment previously stated by Lord Justice Bean, and an earlier case where Lord Justice Holroyde in the case of Pevsner v The Times [2007] FCA 550 (as amended 2010) held that a ‘conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office’ required the defendants’ ‘contrariwise knowledge that such an offence existed’. However, this theory of proof has recently been challenged by Lord Justice Leveson and others. See
