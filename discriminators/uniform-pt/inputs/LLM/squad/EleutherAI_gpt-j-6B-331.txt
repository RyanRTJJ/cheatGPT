 little recognition at the time and the product was marketed through the early 1980's by Swan alone.[3] After receiving a substantial royalty from Swan, the process was improved and marketed by E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company and Hoechst Celanese beginning around 1980. The company that ultimately took over the patent was named E.I. Du Pont de Nemours Cellophane, then DuPont Packaging. The Swan process is similar to the Koppers-Adda process in that it is a modified chemical process.

When cellulose is dissolved in sodium hydroxide and carbon disulfide, a transparent substance that is insoluble in water is obtained. The product is a thin, flexible, transparent, white film, very much like a sheet of ordinary household plastic. The process does not involve the formation of cellulose nitrate or cellulose acetate, and therefore does not affect film's transparency.[1] In an attempt at developing more environmentally friendly film, DuPont created Cellophane using the first generation sulfur-free process, and in 1986 the company invented "Gel-Pak," a new package designed specifically for packaging items such as pet treats.[8]

A further step in the development of Cellophane and Cellophane derivatives was E.I. DuPont de Nemours's discovery of polyvinyl acetate, a material commonly known as "Scotch Tissue." Although originally introduced to industry in the 1960s to produce heat-bonded or thermoplastic composites, by the 1980s, Scotch Tissue had become an important part of the Cellophane structure, with significant uses in a variety of applications, such as the development of flexible lamination films for use in displays, such as portable computers. In order to further promote Scotch Tissue's use, DuPont in 1984 created its own Cellophane subsidiary and began to market its own brand of Cellophane, which would eventually come to be called Scotch Tissue.
