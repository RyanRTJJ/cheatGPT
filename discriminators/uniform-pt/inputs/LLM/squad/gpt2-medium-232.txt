 to recognize "the value in bringing diversity and cultural diversity into your production." With MC Hammer's recent album "Pitch Perfect" featuring Kanye West, it's no surprise for the rap icon to follow suit.

With the album release scheduled for the end of August, we're curious why so many rappers are dropping "Kanye West": the same artist who inspired the most rappers to become hip-hop stars?

Some will say that Drake only released one album of his choosing over his 13-year career and that his choice to work with Kanye West was one he would have readily considered following the success of Chance, Jay Z and Lil Wayne. But maybe one hip-hop insider has bigger plans.

We'll never know for sure since the album's producer told Entertainment Tonight that the name "Kanye West" is "almost a family name" for the label, but this could just be a coincidence since other than some mentions of Chance, Zayn, Lil Wayne and A$AP Rocky before and after the first-ever collaboration with West during his "Tennis Court" album, he is only credited on one track.

While the Kanye West Project has not made any announcements regarding a second project, we imagine that there are more records in the works involving the artist.

What do you think? Does the name "Kanye West" seem interesting for a duo with two of the most prominent rappers in the game?
