 the People's Republic of China. At the end of the Ming Han era, there was also Chinese expansionism.[18]

In a time of military strength and political power, this area experienced fierce rivalries with Chinese influence over Tibet, not least because of two important differences between the two regions: the former favored the Qing dynasty over the Qin dynasty, while the latter was for the Ming dynasty. They shared a common cultural heritage, and Tibetans were divided between an ethnic Tainan ethnic group and an Sichuan ethnic group. In a time of inter-Kibbutzal rivalry, the Tainan faced a strong Chinese military offensive.[19]

After the Qing ruled the region in the ninth century BCE,[20] China's power over Tibet became significant in that it created its own political and economic system. In order to secure their independence, Tainan and Sichuan ruled the region. However, the Tainan and Sichuan held power in separate provinces, and no unified province was created in the ancient Tibetan empire, which also made it difficult for them to consolidate their power in a unified China.[22]

During this long period, a fierce clash broke out between the two areas. The Mongols seized Tainan territory and took other large tracts of Tibet in order to bring Tibet into their own power base and in return, the Tainan were taken in. In 1655, one year after the battle, the Mongolian envoy, Ochubao, who had visited the area, sent his envoy, Shih-Shan, for peace, to the Dalai Lama and asked him to grant peace to both nationsâ€”unbeknownst to him, there was a peace treaty that they had agreed to but which had yet to be approved by the Tainan.[23]

The Tainan, for the most part, were accepted as separate kingdoms under the Qing Dynasty, but were allowed to maintain a stable territory under a joint policy of unity. The Qing would hold the Tibetan land as its own, but could only trade their people
