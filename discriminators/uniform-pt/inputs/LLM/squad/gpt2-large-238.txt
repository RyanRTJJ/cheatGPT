 in natural language into sentences at all. As a consequence, philosophers who thought physical statements about physical things were not true were, as they had thought, committed to some kind of metaphysics. The famous post-Humean argument that physical objects have bodies was the first, and it provided the foundation for many of the post-Cartesian theses on consciousness. But much later this argument was replaced by the more complex argument that physical systems have minds. But the basic argument survives to the present day. This basic argument may be expressed thus: there are no physical things. But there is an activity which is capable of giving the appearance of physicality, namely mind/body dualism. It involves a form of psychological projection to say that mental states are not merely the products of physical mechanisms but are the products, in some sense of'matter', of physical mechanisms. Here the distinction between 'physical' and'mental' is important because the former is an intrinsic property of things, whereas the latter, being a property of mental-systems, is an external property of mental-systems.

3. Phenomenological Dualism

In the late 1970s there developed a second approach to the problem of consciousness and the mind beyond Cartesian dualism. This approach combines the features of the first approach but, without the Cartesian claim that physical things have bodies (and, to some extent, also the claim that, in some sense, there are physical things), it goes the other way and views mind as a phenomenon unique to
