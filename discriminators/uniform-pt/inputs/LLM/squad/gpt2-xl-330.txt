50. D'Angelo Russell, PG, Ohio State: Another talented and experienced player, Russell has taken what may have seemed like a late-round chance in the 2014 NBA Draft and transformed himself into one of the premier players in the country. He is currently averaging 22.5 points, 5.3 assists and 4.4 rebounds per game in the NCAA tournament.

49. Kristaps Porzingis, PF, Latvia: The big man out of Latvia is the perfect floor general in the post for an offense that relies too much on efficiency, making him a great candidate for selection to the U.S. team. After averaging 16.2 points per game with the national team, he will continue to score as a Knick this season.
