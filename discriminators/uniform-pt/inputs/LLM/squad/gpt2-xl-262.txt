 which has gained such rapid success, can still boast an entire freedom." But the "fiery passions" and radicalism that had motivated the British government to act the previous year were now becoming a hindrance to its ability to govern. The Revolution was now an "American one," and the "most valuable possession" of the Crown was in danger. Burke wrote that for him to support revolution would be "a crime."[23]

For Burke a radical politics is not necessary to establish a more reasonable and balanced government, but its removal from the national agenda is. "The state of nature must be left behind us in the age of reason," Burke argued in a 1791 letter to his son.[24] The national government had proved itself unable to serve the needs of a truly free person. By encouraging the "vices" of the people, such as drunkenness, drunkenness fueled the Revolution, and only when it became impossible to ignore the problem could it be ended. The French Revolution could be interpreted as evidence for the need to reestablish a nation-state. Burke believed that the new nation-state would then serve as the political embodiment of the individual's rights. Burke's rejection of radicalism, his criticism of the "fiery passions" that he had embraced during the Revolutionary Age and which had been "buried deep in the national fabric" while the nation's political "fate was in the hands of the few," allowed him to understand the potential danger of violent radicalism
