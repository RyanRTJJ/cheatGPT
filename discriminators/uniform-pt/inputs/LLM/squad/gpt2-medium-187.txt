 lawsuit against KSL. The lawsuit claimed KSL violated its "fair use" and "fair dealing" provisions by making the video. A similar case against Texas-based company Viacom Network is ongoing, according to Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott.

KSL didn't immediately respond to the Post's request for comment.

Abbott filed a suit in September alleging in federal court that KSL illegally profited from the video online using advertising. An investigation was launched after a video appeared on YouTube in September 2014. He said the settlement includes "a $20 million non-refundable payment to compensate plaintiffs for lost revenue and costs they have already suffered at the hands of KSL."

Multer Michalewicz contacted the Post to explain why the lawsuit against KSL was ultimately dismissed as a result of KSL and Viacom. She said Viacom had requested a class-action lawsuit alleging copyright infringement. KSL agreed to pay up to $400 million under this deal, but would not release the names of the artists whose "fair use" would be violated.


"The case is still open and ongoing," Multer Michalewicz said in an email. "[KSL] has taken a very good and thoughtful approach to resolving the alleged infringement with Plaintiffs, however they have also agreed to remove the infringing material from all of the services they currently offer and to reestablish a strict policy governing videos and advertisements by KSL."


Multer Michalewicz said they weren't able to discuss an amended settlement with KSL, but said the company wouldn't comment further because of the pending litigation.
