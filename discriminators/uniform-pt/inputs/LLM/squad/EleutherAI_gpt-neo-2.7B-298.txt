ashes into the back of her hand while in the process of throwing it (i.e., what would look like a perfectly symmetrical scenario).

On the other hand, it is not obvious that the following should be considered symmetrical: an object which falls downward, followed by a human hand grasping it, and which later catches the object between her fingers and shakes it. Yet, here too we have the same kinds of causal patterns.

This is because asymmetrical causation can be regarded as a special case of symmetry. Asymmetrical causation occurs when a cause which is asymmetrical is followed by an effect which is symmetrical, whether or not these asymmetrical causes and effects are really symmetrical in this example. Even if some kinds of causal patterns actually are symmetrical, they can still be regarded as asymmetrical in symmetry.

The idea that some kinds of causation can be asymmetrical with no metaphysically-required asymmetry is called teleological dependence.

For example:

[A] train tracks a plane at the center of a bridge. The train is caused to speed up; but it is following a law of nature which can be explained in terms of efficiency.

Causality in the world is only one of many ways of explaining how it would follow that the train goes faster since other ways are also possible. Hence, it must be said that the train is following a law of nature.

This is one form of teleological dependence. To explain the
