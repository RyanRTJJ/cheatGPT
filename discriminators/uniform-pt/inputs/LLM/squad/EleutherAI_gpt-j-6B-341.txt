 that had been their burrows. The fossilized remains of polychaete tubes are known as perforate tubes, because they pierce the sediment and have a hole at one end for the organism to breath (figure 44). These fossils are usually about 40â€“55 millimetres in size and are found on the seafloor, where they are exposed to wave action and to high pressure.

Figure 44 A polychaete perforate tube that was a part of a large burrow system. Polychaete tubes can have a very wide distribution and size range compared to other burrowing molluscs.

Sediment that fills the tube has the remains of the polychaetes' tissue, such as body parts, tubes, muscles and even organs. The tubes formed by a few polychaete species are similar to large pipes, often found on the sea floor and reaching lengths in excess of 100 metres. In these situations, the length of the tube is much greater than the diameter of the burrow and the sediment, so the polychaete will not be affected by hydrostatic pressure.

The tubes of other polychaetes are similar to giant syringes, where sediment is deposited in the burrow and hardens, forming large tube casts (table 11.2). Most of these tubes are short, less than 10 m in length, and are filled with sediments and organisms, rather than having solid layers containing the polychaete tissue.

##### Table 11.2 Types of Polychaete Tube, as mentioned in the text and in the figure. For example, the type 3 tube in figure 44 depicts Peripatops sp., where tube length is greater than about 2 cm, whereas the type 2 tube shows Heterometrus sp., in which the tube length is less than about 2 cm.
