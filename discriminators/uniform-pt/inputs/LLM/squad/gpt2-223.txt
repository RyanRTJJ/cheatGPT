 When the hippocampus is stressed during wakefulness, this stress accelerates the consolidation of synaptic-afferent relationships. Indeed, in one study, both hippocampus and amygdala are activated during the wakefulness (e.g., Nieuwenhuizen et al., 2011). The hippocampus is also a major area in brain development from the earliest infancy to adulthood (Cramer and Hirsch, 2012).

The importance of sleep during the early weeks of life for the learning of the language

SNA studies have been conducted in children under two years of age. A recent meta-analysis (Cramer and Hoff, 2013) conducted an entire cohort of approximately 2,500 children under two years of age between 1999 and 2012. There is a strong literature, including in children under two years, to suggest a strong impact on the ability of the child to communicate in general (Rochester, 2013; Worswick et al., 2011), but with increasing age, different features of sleep have a different effect. For instance, in another study, the age of the children was independently linked to their ability to learn new words and new tasks (Mendick et al., 2003) and to their ability to learn social skills and language skills (Mendick et al. 2003). Another study, which used information processing tasks, found that children of two to three years of age were more likely to be able to discriminate between words that appear to be written on plastic toys and those that are not (Lopez et al., 2002; Lopez et al., 2004) indicating an age-dependent difference. These results, which were not confirmed by age, suggest that sleep influences language learning while learning new languages
