 Yugoslavia and became a leader of the Communist Party in Croatia. In the following months, he was a major contributor to the formation of the Communist-led revolutionary movement, which quickly gained traction among the people of Yugoslavia. During this period, Tito gained a reputation as a powerful speaker. In December 1920, he was elected as Secretary General of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, a position he would hold until his death in 1980.

Tito was soon involved in a number of unsuccessful attempts to bring down the Yugoslav government, which were eventually crushed. This opposition to the government led to him being sentenced to five years in prison in 1926. He used the time to study Marxism and upon his release in 1932, he had become a prominent and influential political figure. As leader of the Yugoslav Communist Party, he played a major role in unifying the country's communist movement and led the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ). Under his leadership, the Allies helped establish a new Yugoslav government at the end of World War II, making Tito its leader. He served as the President of Yugoslavia for nearly three decades, until his death in 1980.
