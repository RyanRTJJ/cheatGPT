 Eurasian and African landmasses. It was during these early geological periods that large reptile groups evolved. The first reptiles in North America appeared during the Late Jurassic and the first reptiles to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (Kohn 1975) appeared during this time. The first reptiles to reach Japan appeared throughout the Jurassic, but were restricted to the islands of Kyushu and Honshu. They are not found on the islands of Honshu and Chubu. Reptiles also reached Okinawa, the Ryukyu group of islands in the western Pacific, and the Philippines. By the Triassic Period (145.0–93 Ma), birds were widespread. Reptiles continued to extend their range north of the Andes Mountains over much of the eastern Mediterranean region.

The Mesozoic Period (83.6–65.1 Ma) has been defined as the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary. Its boundary marks the first appearance of reptiles in North America, with the first dinosaurs to appear in Japan during this time. Amphibians and mammals also inhabited the region during this time, and, later, nonavian dinosaurs became widespread. The beginning of the Cenozoic in China coincided with the beginning of the Cretaceous Period in North America. The Jurassic period continued from about 70.6 to 65.1 Ma, and marked the end of the Cretaceous Period and the onset of the age of the dinosaurs. Mammals expanded across the Eurasian steppes, including the northern European area, and North America experienced the Age of Mammals, a
