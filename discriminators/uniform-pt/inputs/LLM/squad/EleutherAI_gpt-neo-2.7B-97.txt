 The deal, which has been lauded by casino operators as an investment by the world’s largest provider of banking and financial services, has drawn protests from residents and preservationists.

Located on a former army base, the site is bordered by Interstate 95 on the west and by Atlantic Ocean on the east. The property is bounded on the north by the New Jersey Turnpike and in the south by the U.S. Post Office.

Morgan Stanley plans in the next 25 years to add approximately 3,000 rooms to the resort, bringing Atlantic City’s total hotel capacity to nearly 11,000 rooms.

“This is a much larger facility. It will have more hotel rooms than we currently have,” said Stephen S. Hall, senior manager of Morgan Stanley’s Resort Portfolio.

According to Morgan Stanley, the new resort development will include approximately 450 hotel rooms, 1,150 single-family residential units, and 1,000,000 square feet (27,000 sq m) of retail space. Morgan Stanley said it has a $500 million investment in the resort.

The new development will be anchored by a six-story, 180-unit Hilton hotel on the east side of Atlantic Street, just east of the New Jersey Turnpike. The first phase of building is expected to begin in 2012, with Phase 2 of construction to begin by 2014.

At the Showboat complex, the new Morgan Stanley hotel will contain nearly double the number of rooms of its existing predecessors.
