 they made. A handful of polychaete species with their first polychaete shell, an example of which is Pinnotherium spinicaudis, have been described. The few polychaete fossils are rare, and they are relatively small and, especially the non-mineralized tubes, have been found in association with the remains of other fossil organisms. They were found in strata and layers that contained both plant and animal fossils. The absence of evidence from a fossil record is explained above by the soft-body condition of polychaetes; their fossils are rarely found and in many cases are too small to permit a detailed analysis of their fossils and anatomy. Nevertheless, the description of the fossil remains of Pinnotherium sp., which are described in this paper, illustrates this soft-body condition.

The fossils of polychaetes were discovered, often through misinterpretation of fossil remains of other organisms. This paper first describes Pinnotherium spinicaudis and secondly describes a polychaete from the Hell Creek Formation, Arizona.

Description of the fossil

Pinnotherium spinicaudis was found in association with plant remains. There were fragments of leaves, stems, other attached leaves, and the fossils were found in strata and layers containing both plant and animal fossils. The leaves were preserved with the fossils and they are in direct contact with the fossils. The fossils were preserved in water that had been boiled away, most likely when sediments were exposed or when the polychaete sank in water. The fossil is in the specimen in the Natural History Museum of Utah, with a description for readers, and this is the first report of a fossil of this species in the world.

Pinnotherium spinicaudis has first been described in 1978 (W.R.P. Balfour and D. Nunnari, A new polychaete
