 the southeast, the Alps and the Lake Geneva (Lake Geneva); the Piz Bernina to the northeast, the Lake Zurich (Lake Zurich) and the Alps; and the Ticino Peninsula to the southwest. The Alpine peaks are located along the southern edge of Lake Geneva and are the highest in the Alps. As the name implies, all the Alpine peaks are situated around the lake. The lakes are located east of the central plateau and have an average depth of between 1 to 4 meters. In this article I'll tell you a bit about its geology and tell you about its geomorphology. The following is a brief description of the various types of rock in Switzerland, including quartzite (iron metamorphic igneous rocks such as dolomites), diorite and magnesia, and all of which are present in greater or lesser abundance here. 1.Swiss Alpine Ranges (Alpstein) Alpine ranges are mostly located between latitudes 45° and 48° N in the Alps, but the range in the center of Europe, the Alps, extends to the west and southeast and north over distances of 10 to 15 kilometers. Most of the Alps lie between latitudes 45° and 48° N and are divided into three main Alpine topographic formations – the alpstein, the flint and the limonite. The alpstein consists of basaltic rocks (calcrete-granite or tuff), but quartzite, diorite and magnesia are also found here. Quartzite and diorite can form very weakly on the rocks and the alpstein has very high quartzic rock grain size due to the high mineral pressure. The flint rocks are quartzite
