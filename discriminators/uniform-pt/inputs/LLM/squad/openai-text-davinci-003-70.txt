m the Achaeans, or the larger Greek tribe, consistently identified themselves, especially in their synoecism (ἁπλοῦσιν οἰκεῖν, haplōusin oikeîn).

The Hellenes were among the most influential Ancient Greek tribes, and were present in various periods throughout the Hellenic Age. This included involvement in crucial exchanges of goods and ideas throughout the Mediterranean and beyond, as well as forming a part of the larger Doric-speaking communities that established several key influential city-states in Ancient Greece. 

Due to their wide-reaching influence, the Hellenes were an important force in the development and expansion of the Greek world in all its aspects. This included shaping the cultural, political and religious life within various Greek societies, as well as leaving an impressive legacy behind due to their extensive expansion. The city-states of Sparta and Athens were two of the most prominent examples of the Hellenic tribes' impact and their cultural successes. 

In Homer's Iliad, their small size was used as a metaphor for their lack of power, as the Achaeans employed a similar synoecistic approach to invite them to their alliance. By joining forces, the two tribes found a new strength to challenge the greater enemies that lay ahead. Both Homer and the Hellenes saw this union as a way to create a powerful new force.
