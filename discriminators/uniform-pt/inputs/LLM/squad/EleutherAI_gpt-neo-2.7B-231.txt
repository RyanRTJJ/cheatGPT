It was used as the meeting place of early Irish elites who were part of the Celtic or "Celto-Greco" cultural layer.  This society was already well developed by around 2000 BC, when there is evidence that it may be regarded as the earliest established Celtic polity in Ireland.

The first inhabitants were probably hunter-gatherers.  They may have hunted mammoths.  Pottery from this site generally reflects this original character but changes during the period of occupation, suggesting it had been modified by a larger population.

There was a wide range of settlement types at Newgrange, ranging from large circular mounds, with a central open hearth, to larger, rectangular mounds with round central hearths and an external stone causeway.

Woodgate published a detailed monograph on Newgrange in 1904.  Two of the earliest radiocarbon dating studies, carried out in the 1920s, were of
