 suffered from the most serious Allied bombing campaign during the war. However, although the Germans left an estimated 80,000 to 90,000 troops in the north and west (including Galicia), most of the fighting was in the east. The largest city in the war, Lemberg (Lviv), was taken, but only with the assistance of German forces and the collapse of a Soviet counter-attack. In July 1919, it fell directly following the Battle of Ostrovog, and became the first province to be annexed by Poland. In the west there was only heavy fighting in the Carpathian Mountains, at the end of the war, the Habsburgs had lost Galicia completely, except for the area of Lviv. During the war, an estimated one million civilians in the towns and the countryside suffered from a combination of direct military action, plunder, aerial bombardment and the effects of the ensuing famine. Some 80,000 died of immediate causes, while 2 million Galicians were forcibly resettled by the new state of Poland and the Soviet Union. The war left an area known in the United States as the Western Front or the Eastern Front with an estimated 80 to 120,000 military and civilian casualties, and a further 2 million people of Galician origin in the areas added to the Second Polish Republic. This left a total of 1.3 million casualties.
