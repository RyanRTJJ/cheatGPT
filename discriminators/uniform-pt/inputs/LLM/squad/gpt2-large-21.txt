 This view in turn has been defended primarily by Marxists, most notably in the influential work of Hannah Arendt, who is sometimes thought to have argued in favor of it in connection with the Nazi era.[31] As are all positions that affirm the transcendence of reason at the level of the individual, this perspective has often been criticized, as it fails to give full account of the social world.

Hegel's position, however, was, as we showed above, not simply an attempt to reduce to the level of the individual the moral significance of the notion of conscience in Kantianism. Instead of attempting a complete solution of the dilemma from that point on, Hegel believed that he had been able to arrive at a positive solution in the very form of a formal system.
