 military force were predominantly Greco-Macedonian. That Greco-Macedonian elite had a strong influence on the political and social climate of that empire; in many cases they imposed Greco-Macedonian laws and policies on the city-states. (In addition, Rome itself had a strong influence on the culture of the Greco-Macedonians.) (For detailed discussion of Hellenization in the Roman Empire, see "Hellenization in the Roman Empire. A Brief History" by E. H. F. Jones, M.A. and B.A. Roberts, published by Oxford University Press in 1981; chapter 2 in the Handbook of the Roman Empire. Farrar, Longman and Co. London. 1961.)

As with Greek history, the Greco-Macedonian rulers have been portrayed as heroic orator-pupils of Macedonian culture. "Laches, Lycomedes, and Ptolemies" were part of the cultural mix. (This would be similar to the situation in Athens and Rome, where these names are used in reference to popular figureheads like the heroes Alcmaeon or Alcmaeonides.) (We do not know whether there actually were such people or if their names were given in honour of the "Laches, Lycomedes, and Ptolemies" that are thought to have been the elite of Macedon or to have been chosen as honorary names. This is the subject of a study to be published by Lipscomb College: "Assorted Names used in Antiquity." In a 2003 issue of the Journal of Hellenic Studies (Vol. 15, No. 2), we have a translation of a Greek text on the topic by F. R. Halsall, with a foreword by P. Storz and P. J. Halsall. In the meantime, some readers may find the following text helpful as an introduction to the subject: "Hellenization and Greco-Macedonian Citizenship in Roman Antiquity" by E. E. Wright, M.A. and A. E. Wright, published by J. J. Abrams and Company. (I should mention that the American scholars mentioned in this chapter have not yet published a scholarly article
