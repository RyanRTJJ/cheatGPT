 on the Korean Peninsula. In the Korean Peninsula, Hideyoshi's army was defeated by the army of Joseon Korea at the Battle of Noryang River (노량) and the Battle of Gwangan Bridge (광안댐), and was pushed into the area of Gyesan near Kyongju in June 1597 and was pushed back into the area of Goseong near Sejong City in November of the same year, but both attempts ended in failure owing to an invasion of Korean armies into Japan.

In the middle of the 16th century under the reign of King Seonjo, in order to make Joseon able to withstand Japan's invasion and to prevent an alliance between Japan and Manchuria, the Joseon king constructed great fortifications on the Korean Peninsula, particularly in the areas of the present-day Paju and Yeongsan Provinces in Chungcheong Province. These fortifications were named "Noryang River Fortress" (노량바) and "Gwangsan Fortress" (광산바), respectively.

At the outbreak of the Japanese invasion, Joseon prepared for a long offensive war in Korea (Korea, 로마), and established more than 150 posts and 20 forts to resist the Japanese army.

However, the Joseon king did not take seriously enough the Japanese invasion of Korea and did not actively deploy troops. As a result, the Japanese army conquered more than two-thirds of Korean land, and seized numerous military fortifications on the Korean Peninsula. And they continued their invasion through the areas of the present-day northern and eastern parts of Seoul.

At first, the Joseon king requested the Japan emperor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, to be good to its Korean territory. To this, Hideyoshi gave a negative response, which forced the Joseon king to start an offensive war against Japan.

In September of 1589, there were some conflicts between Korea and Japan at the port of Shimoda (賽黨邑). This is known as the Battle of Shimoda (賽黨邑),
