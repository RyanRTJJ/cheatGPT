 a considerable chunk of this process. In the beginning of learning how to remember something new, the initial memory system is active - the memories are formed and consolidated through memory consolidators that are activated by stimulation of the hypothalamus, resulting in the formation of new memories. The consolidation phase is also called post-learning memory.

During the consolidation phase of memory formation, the mechanisms of the hippocampal formation are in constant flux, each stage modulating and evolving to suit the needs of the cell. The hippocampus has several different layers; the dentate gyrus is responsible for the formation of new long-term autobiographical memories. The substantia nigra produces short-term memory, and the post-synaptic nuclei produce long-term memory. Furthermore, subiculum plays a crucial role in the maintenance of long-term memories, especially those of early memories, both as a storage organ and as an activator.

The hippocampus plays its most active role as a consolidation centre in the brain. It serves as a storage area in memory formation. It stores the hippocampus with the information that is important for subsequent learning. The hippocampal formation, although it is largely associated with consolidation, is also involved in long-term memory consolidation.

Once the hippocampal formation has become established, it must undergo a variety of mechanisms that are not yet clearly understood. At the molecular level, the consolidation and maintenance pathways are linked; at the molecular level, we also observe links between the different memory structures. In fact, the hippocampal formation is
