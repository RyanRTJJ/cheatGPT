 (STE) power plant near Lompoc, California, a 250 kW plant installed by Alta Solar in 1992. Since then, over 6,000 solar thermal systems have been installed throughout the world.

The current estimated costs of solar thermal plants are 2–3 times higher than utility-scale power plants operating with fossil fuels. However, these higher installed costs have been offset substantially by low cost financing plans and high efficiency (over 50 % of the energy goes to the process heating). Most importantly, the net present value (NPV) of solar thermal power plants tends to be positive, which means that the pay-back time is typically less than 10 years. [13] A typical pay-back time for a utility-scale solar thermal plant in the range of 7–10 years. Further, several countries with a lot of sun, e.g., Spain, have electricity-to-heat programs that support projects of this kind, with additional public or private subsidies available.

Solar thermal energy production can have a positive impact on global warming. It is considered to be more greenhouse gas emission-free than other forms of energy production by most global warming advocacy groups, including Greenpeace,[17] and it can provide electricity without generating greenhouse gases during peak solar hours, which is also known as solar off-peak.

In the United States, the main energy policy for solar thermal plants today is the Energy Policy Act. The Energy Policy Act (EPAct) was the first law of its kind in the country and established the first national renewable energy standard (RES) for electricity. Section 1235 (a) of the Act
