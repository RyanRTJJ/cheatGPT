Also, one of Digimon Tamers' major motifs is the role of the Digimon Sovereigns. The Digimon Sovereigns are the guardians of Digimon. They, along with the Digimon Sovereign Partners and the other Digimon Sovereign Stands, guard and keep their Digimon safe from the corrupted side of Tamers, and are the main antagonists of the first half of Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth.

The Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth Hacker's Memory also features two prominent Digimon that are considered antagonists: the Cyber Hacker, who steals the consciousness of several Digimon by using the Digimon Sovereigns as pawns, and the Evil Twin, whose Digimon's memories have been stolen (as well as her own).
