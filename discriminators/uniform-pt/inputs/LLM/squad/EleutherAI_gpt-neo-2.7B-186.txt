 their energetic needs by using a diverse range of food items. Over time, however, this dietary flexibility has been diminished, allowing them to obtain the resources they need from other animals, plants, and debris, and to rely on fat that's less accessible, such as that found in animal corpses, rather than on those that are more readily available. Mammals of the early Cenozoic (the period after the supercontinent Pangaea and up to 20 million years before present) were mostly scavengers, relying on food left behind by animals already dead, and they were probably opportunistic in their choice of foods.

For the long-term survival of their species, mammals also have to contend with other challenges, such as predators, parasites, and the ever-present risk of diseases.

One animal known as the saiga antelope survives in Siberia and is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.

Early Cenozoic mammalian evolution

The Early Cenozoic was a period of extreme change in the mammalian record, starting 10 to 15 million years ago in the northern hemisphere and continuing up to 30 million years ago in the southern hemisphere. Some species of the Early Cenozoic had large body sizes relative to their metabolic requirements, in comparison with more recent evolution. Another evolutionary trend, which affected many species, was the evolution of an ability to hibernate, in which they enter a state of sleep for a few days or weeks at a time and then wake up in the next season. Many species of early mammals were able to become winter-active, and many evolved a range of
