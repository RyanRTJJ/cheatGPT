 following year. The data suggests that teenage female romances can be associated with an increased risk of developing clinically significant depression, particularly in individuals who were not diagnosed with depression at an early age. Furthermore, these relationships can be associated with increased depression symptoms, with at least seven cases of suicidal ideation and behavior (6.5% to 8.9% in two studies) (26). Although these results demonstrate that there are psychological consequences for a romantic relationship, they indicate that there are also psychological consequences for romantic relationships in adolescents. Adolescents may act impulsively when they do not feel well. They may experience an increase in alcohol consumption, have more symptoms of substance abuse and have more depressive symptoms than their peers, leading to an increase in the risk for suicide (26). Although the studies that document the association between girls' romantic relationships and the development of depressive symptoms do indicate that such relationships may reduce depressive symptoms, the validity of these studies is debated. Nevertheless, some parents and clinicians have argued that such relationships can lead to the development of depressive symptoms (2). Thus, because the relationship itself may play a key role in these outcomes, parents should treat adolescents who have such relationships with the same care and attention to their mental well-being as their parents would if their child became depressed. Other reports have suggested that girls living with a partner may also be more motivated to become involved in relationships with other girls or boys (5, 12).
