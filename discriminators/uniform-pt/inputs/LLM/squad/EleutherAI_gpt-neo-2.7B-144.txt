 became firmly under Union control by 1879. It is also one of the few places in Spain where Francoist Spain was not formally annexed – it was ceded to new Spanish states in 1945–46, and the territory remained a province of Franco's Spain until 1977. Nevertheless, the province suffered great economic dislocation. The coal mines were closed between 1931 and 1936, but only the big coal deposit of Castillo del Rio, in the northeast, is still in use. Since then, most of the surviving coal mines have either gone out of production or been replaced by other coal sources, and there are very few areas which have not either been entirely or partially repurposed for tourism, industry, or some other use.

Fishing continued after the war, but it was restricted almost to the coastal areas. The fishing industry was hit disproportionately hard by the closure of the fisheries in the area when the war ended, but even after they were revived, it was hard to get to work because of the damage the war was doing to the port facilities. The fishing industry slowly came back to some sort of normal life by the mid-1950s, but it was never really the same; the new fishing industry was based on trawling vessels (with very long, narrow and deep hulls), which were much more likely
