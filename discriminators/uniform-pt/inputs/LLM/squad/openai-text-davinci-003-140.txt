 face the fact that other less bright students had passed their final examinations.

The accusation of grade inflation in comprehensive schools is certainly one that should be taken seriously by school leaders and policymakers alike. The fact that students of average mathematical ability are failing their final examinations, while sometimes other students of less ability have passed, is of significant concern.

Schools should be taking steps to ensure that exams are no longer just a test of knowledge and ability, but also a measure of a student's understanding and application of the concepts taught in the classroom. Furthermore, the examination setting should be fair for all students, so all students, regardless of ability, have a fair chance of success.

Finally, school leaders should be working hard to ensure all students are being taught the necessary material in order to be successful in their examinations, as well as providing any additional support students need, such as mentoring and tutoring, in order to get the most out of their studies.
