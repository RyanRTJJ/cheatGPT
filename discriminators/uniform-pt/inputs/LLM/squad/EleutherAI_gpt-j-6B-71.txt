 Red Garment." A decade after taking control, Karma decided to give the country his name, Tibet. He was more than willing to cooperate with the neighboring kingdoms of Nepal, Sikkim, Tibet, and Tsang. But he didn't have much money so he had to find it. That led him to an old Chinese encyclopedia.

It had been written by a monk from southern China who had gone north and east to a cave on the Tibetan border. The cave was a secret retreat where the Rinbung had gone for a week-long retreat in honor of their founder, Songtsen Gampo (c. 538–617), who had reigned from 617–623 as the first emperor of Tibet. They had been there for 20 years before they had seen Karma, who had accompanied them. Karma thought the monk's book would be a treasure trove of ideas, stories, and secrets that would make him rich. It contained, among many other things, a method for manufacturing gold — a method still in use!

Karma studied the book and discovered that it was written by a monk from southern China who was known for having a talent for alchemy. In an effort to make gold by fire, he wrote out the process and passed it on by word of mouth to some monks who went to South India where alchemy was practiced. Once the monks received the secret, they passed it on, and within 300 years the practice was in use throughout Europe.

Karma realized he could use this idea to his advantage. When he presented his proposal to the Rinbung, the minister was hesitant to hand over all the secrets. Eventually Karma convinced him but he didn't give away everything. It took Karma another 20 years before he was ready to talk. In return for all the secrets, Karma asked for only one thing: the Tsoktri, the ritual for making gold. For this, Karma would pay the Rinbung an extra 100,000 pieces of gold.
