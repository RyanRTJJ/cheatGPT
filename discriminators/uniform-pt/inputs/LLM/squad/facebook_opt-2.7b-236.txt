 At that time the CBS stations were owned by William Hanna, Sr. who also had the General Electric Corporation's WLW radio stations in Cincinnati. The original plan was for CBS to own all of the city's stations.  Instead, Hanna sold his stations to the Hearst Corporation, and Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) acquired WLW, WNAC and WVIT.  One of these stations changed its call letters to WLW in 1949, though it remains WLW to this day (which, oddly enough, means it is now the only CBS station that still bears the same call sign as it held in the 1930s).

History

Pre-CBS

The Columbia Broadcasting System, formed from the combination of the Columbia Phonograph Company and Columbia Broadcasting Corporation, owned stations throughout the United States. But when William Hanna, Sr. sold his stations to the Hearst Corporation in 1938, Columbia owned just WLW and the WNAC (later the WLW-TV) in Cincinnati. The WLW call sign would become a common one in Cincinnati. It is the only CBS station to have such a call sign.

The General Electric Corporation owned WLW's original Cincinnati stations: WLW-TV, then WLW-FM. In November 1949 a new station WLW-AM-FM was added to the corporation's station group (and to the name). For several months the station was heard on 91.7Â MHz FM, a much stronger signal from which it could broadcast in Cincinnati, and which made it well positioned to compete
