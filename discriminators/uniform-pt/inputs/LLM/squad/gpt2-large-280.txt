 were two systems by which phonographs were produced. In the old phonautograph, the recording of sound was combined with reproduction of sound. This was also the case with the new phonograph. In the new model, the records were produced using the phonograph's electric motors instead of the mechanical one. This resulted in an instrument without moving parts.

There were 2,731,722 phonographs made between March 1878 and March 1881.

1882 was the largest phonograph year ever. 3,500,000 phonographs were made, including many recordable cylinders.

During the early days of the new phonograph, there were several models, all based on an electromechanical motion. On the next generation of phonographs, mechanical motion was adopted. Although it did not use the same motion as the "Old" phonograph, it did operate similarly. Because the early model did not provide records, a series of records were produced which were the equivalent of "doughnut" cylinders, containing the records and records. The cylinders were numbered to reflect the numbers of recordable cylinders on the phonograph. In this way, some owners would be able to check the number of cylinders by turning in the cylinder. When a company made a number of phonographs, there was generally one for every "decade".

1884 was the last year before the United States entered the World Trade Organization. The new United States constitution required that foreign-made devices be registered and therefore a record was issued. The United States also banned the import of phonographs from other countries.
