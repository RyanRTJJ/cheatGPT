 flags but swiftly removed before a speech.

A senior government official who attended the ceremony told CNN the lighting of the torch was to commemorate an agreement in the 1950s.

He added that the United States government planned to hold a "low key" reception during which Chinese citizens could meet with government officials.

It is not clear, however, whether the Chinese government will attend.

US officials, who asked not to be named because they are not authorised to speak on such issues, say they are confident that China will take part.

President Xi Jinping is expected to take part and he will be joined by Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng and other senior leaders.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi said this week that the lighting of the torch was a historical event and that China welcomed the opportunity to cooperate with the United States.

Both sides agree "that light will dispel darkness and darkness will dispel light", he added.

But there is a feeling among US officials that China will go through the motions.

There is, they say, a suspicion in Washington that Mr Xi's government is more interested in the symbolism and optics of the event than the substance of US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's trip, and the agenda that will take place as a result of it.

President Donald Trump and Mr Xi, who met at the US president's Palm Beach resort back in March, are scheduled to hold a summit meeting this week in Vietnam.

That meeting will go a long way to determining whether the US and China are able to turn the page on trade disputes that have weighed heavily on relations in recent months.

China is the US's most important trading partner, and the world's biggest.

Its economy is twice the size of the American economy.
