 a round "beardo."

The edict had a long-lasting effect on Chinese culture, a cultural inheritance through tens of thousands of years.

The "beardo" haircut was also the beginning of a Chinese custom of shaving one's beard to reduce the physical manifestation of one's character.

Nowadays, there is an unwritten tradition of men's "Beardo" haircuts during the Golden Week holiday, which means the first Monday in the month of January.

The haircut is also a way of displaying the man's high status in China, symbolizing that he is a king or a prince or an incarnation of a god.

Beardo haircuts also can be used as a kind of greeting during certain public occasions when the man will be recognized in a way that his face is protected, as in his birth anniversary, weddings, celebrations like the New Year's Day and the Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year and the anniversary of the People's Communist Party (Mao Zedong) in June.

Some women opt to "stipend" for the haircut, paying to have their hair cut for them at the end of the month. Others even hire someone to do a haircut on their behalf.

However, if the haircut is a sign that the man is male-dominated, then its function may still be to demonstrate one's identity.

Shorn hair — with the beardo or the round-topped beardo as the symbol — is seen as "good luck," "welcome," or "a welcome gift."
