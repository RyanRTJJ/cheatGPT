 that the Chinese were able to develop air superiority first largely because they had to, as the Americans refused to participate in the first edition of Operations Unconventional Conduct (or OUC1). In the context of two-sided operations, however, the absence of such participation is usually treated as a strategic weakness, so the Chinese were keen that they take part in OUC1 during its second edition. In particular, they wanted an air defense role similar to Allied tactics during OUC1 in the Battle of the Bulge, and their strategy seems to have paid off, as a significant number of Allied casualties among personnel, equipment and supplies came in the air.

Air control over the northern front remained with the Germans. Although Allied air power was now directed against German troops, there was apparently no coordination between Allied-led and German-led air power. The absence of a combined air strategy seems to have been exacerbated as Germany's air crews were concentrated in their own service area, so that as air sorties were conducted against enemy troops, German aircraft were largely unaffected. This was one of the consequences of the "Bomber's Revolution" during the Battle of Britain in 1939/40, when the RAF air strength had declined by more than 90% from the scale of operations during World War I. This had major repercussions: the German air force was now unable to maintain a cohesive force capable of winning the aerial battles which characterised the early weeks of the war. Instead it suffered from a lack of cohesion, fragmentation, and
