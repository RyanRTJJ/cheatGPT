 asphalt made from human feces, was common among nomads in the Near East. More than a thousand years later, in 2003, the world’s first poop-asphalt road was paved: a paved road in China used by goats, which produce the mineral pitch.

How far we’ve come.

By some accounts, we still have a long way left to go: The United Nations has projected that, in 2050, if no additional steps are taken, the global population will have reached nine billion and we’ll be living on roughly half of the existing land surface—in other words, we’ll be using twice as much land as we have today. The human population, which could exceed nine billion by 2042, would increase global demand for food and other human needs by 50% or more. By 2050, more than nine-tenths of the water on Earth would be used for agriculture or for powering our cities and industries. The majority of these demands would go unanswered or go unmet. And if we’re to keep our current practices, we’ll need to provide food to increase the global population by a further 75% during the next 40 years.

What would the world look like, if we lived to see it? A landscape of urban centers, farms, and livestock operations, and a planet with a radically altered climate, soil, and wildlife? The answer was recently given by a group of global scientists meeting in Paris, where the Intergovernmental Panel on Sustainability’s fifth assessment report was released. In a nutshell, the “planetary boundaries” the scientists identified for humanity to stay within this century include a “safe” limit for the rate
