 religious convictions before the Diet of Worms in 1521. The various Protestant movements, however, interpreted and applied freedom of conscience differently in terms of self-determination over religious convictions, the right to differ in theological matters, and the right to religious liberty. In many ways, these diverse understandings of religious freedom were informed by the political, economic and social context in which these traditions were situated. Some Protestant movements understood religious freedom as the right of individuals to decide their beliefs and practice them according to their conscience. Others viewed religious freedom as the right to freedom of thought and expression (including freedom of speech) and the right to disagree on religious matters. Still others sought to secure true religious liberty as a legal and political right to practice one's faith regardless of one's geographical locality or political authority. In spite of their differences, most Protestants viewed religious freedom as an essential part of a just and free society.

In the wake of the Reformation and subsequent Protestant movements, many governments passed laws granting religious freedom, such as The Act of Toleration in 1689 in England. This act allowed for Protestant dissenters and Catholics to practice their faith without facing persecution or discrimination. Moreover, the US Bill of Rights and the US Constitution guaranteed the right to religious freedom, although the scope of religious freedom has been subject to legal debates and cases.

Finally, religious freedom has been an important part of international law as well, particularly through United Nations conventions and subsequent regional agreements. For example, Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)
