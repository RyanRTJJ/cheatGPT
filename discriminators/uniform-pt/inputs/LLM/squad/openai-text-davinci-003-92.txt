nged attack from Caen, Dieppe and Rouen. His troops from southern England had yet to arrive and John's nervousness showed in his lack of decisive action and he was unable to effectively concentrate his forces.

The attack from Rouen was led by William de Roches, who instead of marching towards Château Gaillard, decided to march towards Vernon instead, hoping to relieve the siege there. John's forces were also unsuccessful in the other two assaults as Philip had positioned a vast army at the gates of Château Gaillard. William de Roches’s decision to bypass Château Gaillard had further weakened John's position and the French eventually captured the castle in the spring of 1204.
