 interactions between them. This allowed him to develop a consistent framework for understanding the behavior of matter and energy. His diagrams became known as Feynman diagrams, and they have become a key tool in many areas of physics and are now incorporated into the core curriculum of quantum field theory and quantum mechanics. To date, Feynman diagrams are considered one of the most important contributions to modern physics, and they are widely used in textbooks, research papers, and lectures.
