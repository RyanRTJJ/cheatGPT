 Rights, headed by Charles G. Ross, the President's Press Secretary.

The Committee's purpose was to gather information on civil rights issues and recommend potential solutions. President Truman dedicated the committee's findings to the memory of Sergeant Woodard, writing in his 1946 Foreign Affairs report that "I have ordered an inquiry by the President's Committee on Civil Rights into the facts involved in the unfortunate case of Isaac Woodard and have asked them to recommend what should be done as a result of the incident."

The Committee made several recommendations, including: the end of lynching and other mob violence, the defense of voting rights, the elimination of employment discrimination, the elimination of segregation in public education, federal civil rights protection for all citizens, an anti-poll tax amendment, the repeal of restrictive covenants, and the protection of the civil rights of immigrant and minority groups.

The Committee's work, along with the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education, formed the basis for further civil rights legislation. President Lyndon B. Johnson, for example, signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act following the efforts of the Committee. While the efforts of the Committee in and of itself did not achieve legal victories in regards to civil rights, it did move the conversation forward and helped pave the way for legislative victories.
