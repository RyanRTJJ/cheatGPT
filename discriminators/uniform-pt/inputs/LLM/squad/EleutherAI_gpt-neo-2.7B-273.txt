 the stomach and upper intestine. The gastric phase is divided into an upper phase and a lower phase. There are two gastric phases, one in the stomach and the other in the small intestine. The lower gastric phase or intestinal phase is divided into two types by activity of intestinal peristalsis. It lasts 3-4 hours and the activity of intestinal peristalsis in this phase can be divided into the ‘gastric phase I’ and the ‘gastric phase II’. The ‘gastric phase I’ of intestinal peristalsis lasts 6-8 hours. This is the period that the enzyme trypsin plays an essential role. The ‘gastric phase II” lasts 1-2 hours and, it is considered to be due to the release of acetylcholine at the intestinal muscarinic, butyropharygeal and vagus nerve. It is, therefore believed that the cephalic phase begins when the second wave of intestinal peristalsis begins.

The upper stomach (gastric) phase is preceded by the stomach contents release from the stomach, such as gas and liquid, where intestinal peristalsis takes place rapidly, so the action of the digestion enzyme can begin. The ‘gastric phase I’ is followed by the ‘gastric phase II’ of intestinal peristalsis. The gastric mucosa is more protected from the acid, the duodenal wall as a barrier. The ‘gastric phase II’ may last 1-2 hours.

According to the standard method of analysis, only intestinal content could be digested, there is no digested materials present in the upper stomach of guinea pigs, and
