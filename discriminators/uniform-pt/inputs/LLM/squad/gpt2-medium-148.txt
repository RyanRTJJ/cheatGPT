 education as one of the pillars of the modern state as it supports life, culture, and livelihood for its citizens.

Education promotes the formation of a diverse, cohesive nation-state with a healthy spirit of collaboration and civic action. Studies by the Israel Democracy Institute have shown the effectiveness of education in building good will, civic engagement, and participation. Educational professionals are also important in raising the level of citizen discourse and building an understanding of modern Israel.

The educational system has produced many talented people within the Israeli political and cultural elite, including the famous novelist Avnei Bereisi, as well as renowned artists, writers and musicians, among others. An impressive list speaks volumes of the breadth and depth of the Israeli education system, not only in the sciences and technology, but also in other realms such as human rights, literature, and economics.


Settlement in the settlements is prohibited, and under normal circumstances a home to two children in their families cannot be a barrier to employment. Because of Israel's policy of restricting construction in the settlements, and particularly in the Area C, there are severe restrictions to employment.

Mentors who teach in Area C and those engaged in community organizing are subjected to constant harassment by settlers. The settlers even visit settlements and conduct illegal surveillance of members of the Palestinian community.

The State of Israel's obligation to protect and sustain the civil, political, and economic rights of its citizens, especially the right of citizens of the State of Israel to live in Israel, includes access to educational, cultural, social and health services provided in accordance with the laws.
