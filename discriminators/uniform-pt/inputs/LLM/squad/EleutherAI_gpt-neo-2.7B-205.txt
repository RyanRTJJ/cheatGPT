Beyoncé’s debut topped the Billboard 200 one month after its release (and sold approximately 1.2 million copies the second time around); the single “Formation” (the album’s second single, and the best-performing single in her career to-date) topped the US Billboard Hot 100. Her sixth studio album Lemonade debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, selling over 1.15 million copies in its first week. Beyoncé and her team continued their work to make Lemonade the best-selling album of 2013 and the second-best-selling album of all time on the Billboard 200.

The album also topped the Billboard charts in several other countries, including Canada (Canada), Australia (Australia), and New Zealand (New Zealand); Billboard, as with many music statistics outlets, lists its US sales as one record for multiple countries. The album debuted at No. 1 in its homeland, selling over 500,000 copies (and more than 1.8 million copies by July 2015). The album was the most successful debut in the US ever. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Lemonade sold over 1.9 million units and over 2.9 million copies in the first week of its release in the US. By the third week (February 14, 2014), the album had sold over 3.5 million units and over 5.5 million copies, making it the fastest-selling album in the US and the second-biggest Billboard 200 album.
