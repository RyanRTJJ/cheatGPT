aylimah (The pagan) on the order of a man by the name of Abdullah Ibn Abbas. It is said that Abdullah Ibn Abbas heard the recitation of some verses of the Quran by Musaylimah (the enemy) and believed it as revelation from Allah. The verses were as follows:

He, at the time, resided in the city of Taqi al-`Ansi (The True One of the Faith). It is said that there was an army camp in that region. During the battle Musaylimah’s army was defeated and the whole army was killed. After the death of Musaylimah, Abdullah Ibn Abbas sent for those who knew verses of the Quran by heart and taught their recitation to others. In this way, many people became Muslims.
