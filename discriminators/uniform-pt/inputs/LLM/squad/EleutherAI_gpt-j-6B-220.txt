 the novel draws upon the legal system for an insight into its characters. In her article From Scratch to Death Row: Legal References in To Kill a Mockingbird, she traces legal references back to To Kill a Mockingbird's characters and the story arc, discussing examples from the novel, such as racial inequalities in the legal system, how this legal hierarchy might influence the case by the Attorneys; Jem's and Dill's experience of an angry crowd; the theme of second chance; Harper Lee's reaction to the racial issues in the courtroom in relation to her own experience. She writes, "The reference to the legal system in To Kill a Mockingbird is not accidental and it contributes a layer of realism that is missing from the fiction we read in school."

L. C. Dale Jr. uses To Kill A Mockingbird as a textbook on literature and the law by demonstrating a connection. He explores aspects of the novel, such as Dill's ability to learn to tolerate others even when they were wrong. He suggests that the novel is an example of legal advocacy, as it focuses on the need for an understanding of the legal system and the law from a young age in order to understand and deal with the realities faced by the citizens in their own towns. The book serves as an example of an American novel that addresses issues of social justice and equality.
