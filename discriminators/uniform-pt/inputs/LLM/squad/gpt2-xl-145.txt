ased human cells that represents a 'population' of pathogenic organisms is added, and the culture is incubated and eventually examined for certain disease-causing agents by means of biochemical and/or electron microscopy or other means. Microfluidics is an emerging paradigm within the healthcare industry as it provides an excellent platform for investigating the physiological impact of specific diseases at the cellular and molecular level.

The clinical application of this technique has so far been limited by the short amount of data available on the cellular and molecular level. One of the major issues with cultured and fixed cell suspensions is that the cells are often collected and then incubated for a short amount of time (usually 24–48 hours) and stored at an acceptable temperature (21–50 °C). The resulting cultures may be unsuitable for many purposes, because many of the pathogens present may have entered the culture before any initial infection and the culture has been transformed (reviewed in [14,15]). For the purposes of clinical research, an important consideration is the possibility of altering the culture conditions to improve the ability to detect infectious diseases in a clinical context. The most important factors for achieving this include the ability to isolate viable cells from the suspension (i.e., cells that have remained viable for at least one hour since the culture was started). Furthermore, many pathogenic agents are resistant to some of the more
