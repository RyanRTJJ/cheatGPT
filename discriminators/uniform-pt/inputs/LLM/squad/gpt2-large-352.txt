 Evolution. This series is a darker, more action packed, and more unique in every way at the expense of nostalgia. Digimon Fusion is a strange and unpredictable experience that takes the Digimon franchise to new and interesting places, and its unique aesthetic and sound effects are a great example of this. While some fans have criticized Digimon Fusion as being too derivative of Digimon Digimon World, I believe this series was intended to follow the path of that franchise. Digimon Fusion is the most recent in the series, with its fourth season premiering in late 2007, which I'll discuss in the following section.

Digimon Fusion is a series that is defined more by its lack of continuity than anything else. Digimon Fusion allows a host of characters to show up in three Digimon novels: Tamers. Tamers is the first main Digimon novel published after Digimon Fusion, and is a great one. The novel is a gritty gritty noir, a dark sci-fi mystery set in a near-future Japan. It focuses primarily on the relationships between the protagonists, and many of the characters are also playable in the game. While the plot itself is not particularly complex, the characters presented in the novel are extremely well done. Every character is a complex, well developed main character, and the story itself seems to unfold from a very deep, deep, deep character perspective.

The four main characters of Tamers are Mamo, a high school girl who is a cyborg, a high school boy named Saika, the main character of Digimon Xros
