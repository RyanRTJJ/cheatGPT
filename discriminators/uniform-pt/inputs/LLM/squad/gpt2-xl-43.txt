 of the Iberian Peninsula.

By the Late Pleistocene period, however, the people living in the region had already moved into a new territory, and they brought with them their own culture, languages, religions and mythology, which, however, took time to be assimilated.

Galicia is now home to the largest number of Catalan speakers (about 100,000 for the whole of Catalonia) in Europe, with around 30 per cent of their population having their roots in Galicia.

With the exception of a small community in La Cañada de Cadaqués, the region had very little contact with Galicia in Roman times, when it was part of the province of Aquitaine.

But eventually, in the 3rd Century BC, Roman legions fought their way into Galicia, and this led to the creation of a province for the province of Aquitaine (later given the name of Aragon). The capital of this new province was Pizarro, a centre of the Aquitaine kingdom that was conquered in 312 AD and incorporated into Spain.

Pizarro is now known as the "Gala Plaza" and its name was subsequently used for the medieval Castillo de San Lázaro in the northern region of the province of Aragon.

Modern times [ edit ]

A new province, Aragon, had been established (along with Catalonia, Asturias and the Balearic Islands in the north) in the 9th Century, with the first king of Aragon being Roderick I (1214–1269/700–1326). Many of Spain's rulers would take their names from this founding region from the 12th Century onwards.

Since 1714, however, Catalonia has had the autonomous status of an autonomous region and in 1931, the Catalan Parliament was established, leading to the formation of the Catalan Government. In 1934, the region entered a state of self-government, although this was abolished by Francisco Franco in 1975.

In October 1997, the Catalan Parliament decided on a new constitution
