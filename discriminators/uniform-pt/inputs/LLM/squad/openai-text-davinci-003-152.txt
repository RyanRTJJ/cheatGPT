n region, establishing the Chola Empire. Noted for their patronage of the arts and their strong centralized government, the Cholas were innovative rulers whose governance was focused on justice, economic prosperity, and religious tolerance.

The Chola dynasty primacy was established by Rajaraja Chola I (reigned c. 985–1014 CE) and Rajendra Chola I (reigned c. 1012–1044 CE), the first Chola kings to conquer the northern parts of India up to the Ganges river. Pathinesamudram, Korkai, and Kaveripattinam were important ports and had strong ports, which made them important trading hubs with Southeast Asia and the world. They also fought a number of successful military campaigns, both within the Indian subcontinent, as well as against the imperial powers of the Arab world such as the Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates.

Under the Cholas, a number of magnificent monuments were constructed, such as the Brihadishvara Temple in Thanjavur and the Airavatesvara Temple in Darasuram. The Chola period saw the rise of many fine artistes, such as Govinda Dikshitar (composer) and Jain Narayanan Chettiar (sculptor). In addition to the temple-building tradition, the Chola period saw the growth of Dravidian literature, fine arts and architecture, music and dance.

Overall, the strong military and centralized government of the Cholas enabled them to effectively rule and expand their empire, and their patronage of the arts and culture ensured that their legacy carved a lasting impression in India's history.
