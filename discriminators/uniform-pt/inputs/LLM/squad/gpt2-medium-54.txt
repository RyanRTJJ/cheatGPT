 of 10,000 men under the command of General Meiji Yoshimo and his lieutenant General Hideiro Yagura. Though Toyotomi had already committed Japan's first invasion, he had a more immediate cause. At this stage in history both sides faced several significant potential threats, one of which was Chinese expansion. By 1595 Yoshiro had already defeated Meiji in a land battle. Yet Toyotomi and his men's arrival threatened all Japanese interests. Toyotomi's invasion seemed a small price to pay to gain the support of Meiji's army. "In the spring of 1595, the Tokugawa shogunate finally conceded its last war after eight decades," wrote Stephen A. Barrow in "Shogi: A Companion." "By 1575 the final victory had broken over the East Asian countries, and the Japanese were losing the war with China, now the world's fourth-largest commercial nation."

The Japanese had been defeated again and again in a brutal war against Chinese rival Ming Dynasty rulers, and when Japan was at peace with China to begin with, Toyotomi's invasion of China was inevitable. The Chinese had not had enough time to invade Western Europe and Asia and had therefore only recently established a military presence on the coast of Africa. So in the spring of 1575 it was Japan's turn. Toyotomi was aware that the Battle of Hastings was likely to draw a huge number of men. In May of the following autumn he asked Japan's consul in Constantinople to make sure that they would have ample time to prepare for war.

The Tokugawa shogunate had been forced to acknowledge this fact and had agreed to surrender the empire that had once been the vassal state of Egypt to the crown. With victory in sight, Japan turned its full attention to Asia. At this time China would be the largest country to which Japan had access. The port
