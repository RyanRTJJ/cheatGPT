 related issues (e.g., sexual problems such as anxiety, relationship problems, and drug use), are relatively well understood, the development of other risk factors, including those involving alcohol and substance use, can involve a whole host of more complex interplays. The majority of alcohol and substance-related problems among adolescents occurs with family members, yet family processes are less understood in relation to the increasing popularity of peer and gang interactions.

To better understand and improve alcohol and substance use among adolescents, one of the most useful avenues is examining the role of family processes in adolescents' risk for these difficulties. We define family processes as the interactions and interactions with family. Family processes are characterized as a set of individual, family, and interpersonal variables that together determine how a family member behaves and responds. Family processes have been defined as "the set of social determinants that influence the family systems that determine an individual's behavior \[...\] \[t\]he key characteristics of these processes in the family system are the characteristics of the relationships that have been created by adults with regard to the particular individual that the family is attempting to deal with" (Burgoyne, [@CIT0009], p. 716). Family processes influence an adolescent (e.g., risk-taking) and ultimately lead to his or her actions through an individual's internal characteristics and environment (e.g., parenting and peer influences), or through the specific interpersonal behaviors of the family members themselves. The latter has been described as having "the same structure and function in both family and society" (Burgoyne, [@CIT0009], p. 716).
