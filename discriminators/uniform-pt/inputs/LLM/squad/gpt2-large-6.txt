onso X, the first of the Spanish popes, visited the church in 1631 (reprinted in De Romana Vat), and the "Giant Chapel" was in use by the church for almost twenty years after the new pope. (See "La Colleciaria di San Francisco de Quito", vol. 1, #20, 1980, available on this Web site.)


From the 12th to the 13th century the nave of the cathedral underwent radical reconstructions, from a simple cist chapel decorated with the famous "Giant Chapel" in 1601, to more than 200 rooms with stained glass windows and an amazing series of arches over the church.


The cathedral church remains a beautiful architectural achievement to this day, with a very tall and well-preserved nave and a very clean cathedral gallery of the last 14th century. During the 15th century the choir was reconstructed and a new nave was added. In 1702, in a new building which has since been known as the "Rome Room" (Latin for "Room of Rome"), the choir was closed. By 1722, the cathedral church was in the hands of Benedict XV, who used it for his residence until his abdication in 1831. This is very similar to the Benedictine Monastery, at the mouth of the Segovia.


The cathedral church is a fine example of a large Spanish Franciscan Benedictine Monastery built by Franciscan brothers, Manuel delgado de Barrameda of the 13th century and Don Luis de Barrameda,
