Israel is currently debating plans for a new flag that would include Hebrew.

In fact, a poll released earlier this year found that 76 percent of Israelis believe it is important for Jews everywhere to understand Hebrew. This represents a dramatic rise from 2005 when only 39 percent said it was important. This increase in demand for Hebrew has led to an increase in new homes being built in the country, in part because of the popularity of Hebrew in Israeli school systems as a language of study, as well a major decline in the number of immigrants from the Arab world who came to Israel in the past decades.

Israel has the second largest Jewish diaspora in the world and the population of the Diaspora is expected to exceed those of Israel in 2040. The largest number of Jewish immigrants are from the Arab world, with an estimated 30 million residents of Arab countries who live in Israel.

According to the Jewish Agency and the government, the country's Jewish population now stands at 10 million, of whom 10 million are immigrants and 6 million have been born in Israel. As a result, approximately 75 percent of Israel's 1.8 million people are Jewish.

This framework was designed to prevent the establishment of an Arab state
