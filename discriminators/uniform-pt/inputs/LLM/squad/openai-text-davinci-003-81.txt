: strong, timely maneuvers and the ability to move large numbers of troops with speed and agility. He ordered the three main corps of the Grande Armée to move swiftly with great burst of energy, both on the march and in battle. The momentum of the French advance was to be maintained and they were to go on the offensive at any opportunity.

The maneuvering of the Grande Armée included a thrust eastward into Prussia, with two prongs led by Marshals Ney and Augereau. Ney’s 20,000-man corps “made a feint to the northeast, an action which was to eventually separate the larger Prussian army in two and force the smaller force to retreat”. Meanwhile, Augereau’s 26,000 troops made a “sweeping movement toward the Oder”. Initially, the Prussian forces attempted to stop the French advance, but they soon had to retreat due to the overwhelming strength of the French.

The maneuvers of the Grand Armée in the opening months of the campaign were instrumental in allowing Napoleon to quickly seize key strategic points in Prussia. The maneuvers also allowed Decaen's III Corps to link up with Davout's I Corps, who had been besieging Danzig, eventually resulting in the surrender of the city and the Prussian army. In all, the strategic maneuvering of the Grande Armée enabled a swift and effective victory for the French during this campaign.
