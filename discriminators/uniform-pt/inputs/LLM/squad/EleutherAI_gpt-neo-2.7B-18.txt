 Population Diversity." Their argument rests on three theses: (1) The biological species concept ("species" is a human invention that has no meaning outside of the human context) is useless in the human species; (2) there are no genuine genetic groups in human populations; and (3) the genetic differences between populations represent a significant but illusory genetic diversity ("the real heritability of genetic variation is much less than that claimed by geneticists"). I argue that genetic groups do indeed exist and are well-defined in human populations. Kittles does not go far enough and I show that his critique is mistaken. If Long's critique is indeed correct, this means that biological genetic variation may be an illusory variety under the species concept and the fact that real genetic variation is poorly understood may explain why genetic differences between people are poorly understood.

1. Genetic diversity and species

The existence, classification and evolution of genetic variation are not the same thing. The first part of Kittles's claim that the species concept is useless in humans is easily refuted. Genetic differences between humans are not unimportant for health reasons or the environment and neither are they random. For example, differences that cause variation in resistance to HIV are very important scientifically. They account for most the genetic diversity within human populations. The concept of a species makes sense only in an artificial context where diversity is measured by the numbers of a population, not by its genetic identity. The definition of the species concept, to be useful outside of this artificial context, has to acknowledge this non-random diversity.

Since humans (and all other modern animals) have a genetic identity but a genetic diversity, the existence of a species has little meaning for the human species. Genetic variation must be taken into account.
