 evolutionist arguments could not have a plausible scientific meaning in human thought. This was because evolutionists had no empirical scientific explanation to support their claim, only a subjective feeling of belief in a higher deity. The reason that evolutionist claims are hard to prove even though they have been argued from the beginning has to do with the way humans are conceptualized in terms of "naturalism," meaning that the belief in a higher power is a natural phenomenon of human psychology and is generally agreed upon by all humans.

In their first two lectures, Spencer claimed that it is impossible to prove the existence of the creator after all that exists now because our "natural instincts are very bad [and] it would be foolish to try to prove to God or anyone else that these instincts cannot exist."[page needed] If evolution is true, then naturalism will still be true, because no one has proven that natural principles cannot be proven.[3] Because this idea of naturalism is not at all convincing, Spencer claimed that naturalism and evolution are not synonymous. He argued that we should accept the existence of a higher power in order to understand the "evolutionary process."[4] Spencer was especially hostile to Dawkins.[page needed]

For the purposes of this article, Darwinist evolutionists are assumed to be evolutionary naturalists.

Theistic evolution

In 1872, Isaac Newton, a naturalist and an atheist, presented his theory of natural selection to support Darwin's theory of natural selection. He argued that humans originated as homo sapiens, not one of other homo sapiens species, as was believed before Darwin
