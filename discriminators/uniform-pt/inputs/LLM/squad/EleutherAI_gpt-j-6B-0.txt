-hitter in a 4-0 win at St. Louis on August 13, and the Cubs went on to clinch a playoff berth that season by winning six of their last nine at Wrigley Field against Milwaukee.

Chicago made the World Series for the first time since 1945–46 and the franchise has lost only twice in the city itself since then. Since 1900 the Cubs have won more than five games in a single NLCS season once and more than 20 twice–in 1906 and in 1945, when the Cubs finished second, losing the pennant to New York in the World Series and, by winning the NL pennant, winning two World Series that same season, becoming the first NL team to accomplish twice.

1939–1960: The Good Years
The early and mid- to late-20th century years have been recognized as some of the club's most glorious, as Chicago won five National League pennants, four World Series (1945, 1957, 1959, and 2008), a total of 10 NL East titles, and had more than 40 future Hall of Famers. During these years the Cubs won the National League with a franchise-record 116 wins in 1940, 111 wins in 1953, 107 wins in 1954, and 103 wins in 1956, and led the NL by 15 games in 1945. During the "golden age" of the Cubs, the National League began a three-season "strike" during the 1957–59 baseball seasons when attendance dropped, and when the strike ended the team had lost $3 million. These losses, however, were offset by the huge increase in revenues due to the growth of television broadcasts during this time, and the team broke even in 1963 and 1964.

This was also the first Cubs team to begin its climb to the top of the National League standings. The Cubs won their first pennant in 1945, when they finished in first place in the NL with a 90–54 record. They finished one game out of first place in 1946, and then in 1948, 1951, 1953, and 1955 all finished inside the top four. The Cubs then placed in every top-four year from 1949 to 1955. In 1956, the Cubs won their first NL East title in 10 years and also posted a National League-record 114 regular-season wins
