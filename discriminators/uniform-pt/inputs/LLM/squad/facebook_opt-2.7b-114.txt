 Pandavas of the Deccan, and the Nizam of Hyderabad. This fierce rivalry would not only lead to one of the deadliest armed conflicts in Indian history, it would also lead to the division of India into two major territories and the eventual formation of Pakistan in 1947. If you like the world of India, its people, food, and music, then this three-hour course is for you!

The course begins on Thursday, May 12 and finishes on Friday, May 13. The participants start classes at 6:30 PM and continue until 10:30 PM. It may be repeated as a part of a course of up to three days. There will be no additional charge on the second course if you want to take it in this form. The course fee is Rs. 1200 per person, but the participants can get it for $50 (40â‚¬) if they arrive before 4pm on Wednesday.

I would like to thank the organizers and my friends in the South Asian Program at NYU that have given me the opportunity to come and teach. If you live in the NYC region or if you just wish to come and learn more about India, or to ask questions about the course, please email me, nathanael-at-nau-edu.

I hope that this course will provide a nice and good experience for the participants whether they stay the full course or extend it.

This course can be conducted in English only. If you are interested in being part of the group, please
