 is still the largest public radio station in the US, and its broadcasts are available over the internet with no cable, so "home-tuner" radio does not exist. At the end of November 2015, NPR launched the NPR Station Finder, which allows users to find NPR stations and podcasts, and even play them on their own computers.

The Washington Post publishes a "News" section (the "News section" because every story is just a giant box with some photos on the front page) that features stories such as the one shown on the right, a story about the Senate Judiciary Committee's inquiry on the NSA's telephony metadata program called The PRISM program and a post on the Post's homepage titled "The NSA is collecting phone records in bulk without a court order", along with a collection of Post-It notes. It is in the Post's interest to bring new readers to its front page, not to write about the NSA scandal.

There is no news page at the Guardian. Not even a link to the Washington Post's article about the Guardian's revelations about Prism. That means no coverage of the documents that led to the Snowden leaks. Why would there be? The NSA is already collecting information about people's email. The NSA gathers information about people's emails. As with the Post, there is no news page, therefore not enough news for new readers.
