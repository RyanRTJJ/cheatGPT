s a matter of debate. Some reports indicate that the current levels have been fairly stable since 2011, while others suggest that Apple has been seeing a consistent year-over-year increase in both metrics. Apple recently reported that the Mac's active installed base has grown 40% within the past year, indicating steady growth. 

Generally speaking, Macs are more popular in North America than in other regions. In fact, according to one report, Macs accounted for roughly 20% of all personal computer sales in the US and Canada in 2014, compared to a 12.5% global market share. The US also has the largest installed base of Macs in the world, making it the biggest market for Apple's desktop and laptop machines. 

Overall, while North America is the largest region for Apple computers in terms of both market share and installed base, there is still room for further growth, particularly in other markets. Apple is making efforts to expand its presence in emerging markets such as India, which has become the third largest market for the Mac, and China, where the Mac's installed base has grown 30% over the past year.
