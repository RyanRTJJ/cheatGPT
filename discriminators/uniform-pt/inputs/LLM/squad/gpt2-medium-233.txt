.e., substances that break in and out of solution), whereas several are scavengers (i.e., substances that remove toxic components of free radicals). In addition, free radicals increase the rate of oxidative damage in many organs. For example, free radicals are associated with damage to mitochondria due to DNA damage, oxygen-consuming oxidants such as phospholipase A2, and lipoxygenase. Free radicals act as chemotherapeutics. In the liver, free radicals can damage fatty acids and oxygen-carrying metabolites, thereby decreasing oxygenated blood flow and thereby suppressing blood production of some critical vitamins and vitamins specific enzymes (e.g., vitamin B12), reducing insulin secretion and inhibiting metabolism.

To evaluate potential protective effects of drinking water on health, it is important to understand the mechanism that free radicals play, and how this is mediated in the gut. First, it is important to distinguish between metabolic and oxidative health damage on a cellular level. There is extensive evidence that both metabolic and oxidative health can be negatively altered by free radical mediation in the gastrointestinal tract at various points in the post-absorptive process.

There is no doubt that drinking water is rich in free radicals. The rate of cellular oxidation in the gut is approximately two times the rate in the rest of tissue, the maximum known rate of total oxidative damage among mammals. However, a considerable amount of oxidative damage is also due to the inflammatory, viral, metabolic, inflammatory-epidermal, and bacterial stress responses occurring simultaneously in the
