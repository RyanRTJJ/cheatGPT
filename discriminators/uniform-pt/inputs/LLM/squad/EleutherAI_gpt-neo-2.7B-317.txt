 jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is generally limited to the country's highest courts, but also those courts that cover specific issues or controversies. The Supreme Court also hears appeals from lower courts when a lower court has ruled against the validity of an act or judgment that had been passed into law. The Court's rulings will not be changed by the legislative, executive or judicial authorities.

The highest Court is constituted by two or more judges. The Court has seven divisions, each headed by a Chief Justice, and each division is made up of an average of twelve judges (the number of judges is increased in exceptional cases). Each judge sits on his or her own, although judges are allocated to the divisions on the basis of seniority. The seven divisions, which function independently and serve as trial courts, are divided into as follows:

The first to be appointed was Shmuel Bar-On (1889), and then in 1892, Eliezer Yaari. After World War II, a total of eight Jewish judges were appointed, including David Shazar after the war, Shmaryahu Oshry, Meir Doron, Avihai Avichail, Asher Yaari (1951), Joseph Dweik (1957) and the more recent, Avraham Schimmelzum. The first Arab who joined the Israeli Supreme Court was Ihsan Mahad, who served from 1950 until 1956.
