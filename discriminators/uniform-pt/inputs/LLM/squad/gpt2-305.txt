Phenomelian fishes, known as the Parachutes, are sometimes called the "supernatural predators, and to me can be seen as having been part of a much wider evolutionary development by nature. A new branch of the classification of the creature is that of parasitic creatures, known as cholera fish, that are thought to have taken place through selective breeding at the earliest stages of evolution.

In a recent study, published in the journal Current Biology, researchers with The Zoological Society of London, discovered that parachute fishes, which are actually closely related to the fish that were known as superheros, have evolved to the point that they have evolved as a kind of parasitic predator. The parasite that caught the parachute was a parasite which then became a parasitoid. The researchers noticed that in parachute fish, the parasite which is considered a new species is not the parasitic parasite they originally thought but the parasitic parasite thought to be a species of the superheros fish. Their new parasite, called a subspecies of the superheros.

The scientists were also able to identify that some of these parasites have been found living on a parachute, which could potentially be very valuable insight for understanding the development of the human race.

"It provides important information about the level of understanding that's needed in the coming years to bring about the eradication of parasitic species, because we now know that parasitoid parasites are not common, but rather relatively rare," explains Professor A.T. Legg.

"It was very exciting to do this because we know that many of the parasites we've seen on parachute and other marine fishes in the wild have been brought to our attention through captive breeding or through species breeding. We then want to understand how the parasite actually developed, which has shown that it didn't evolve as it would have initially thought."

"If this new class of parasite species and what may, in turn, become more so, the implications are huge and we need to be sure that our findings are right. It may be that parasite genes were changed or that parasites developed without really evolving or evolving as they would have in human beings," explains Professor A.T. Legg.
