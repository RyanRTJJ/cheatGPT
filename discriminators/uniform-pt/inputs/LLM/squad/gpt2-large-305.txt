. The natural range of many of these hybrids has been influenced and influenced and influenced by humans using breeding methods which are neither natural nor necessary.

Hybridisation is done intentionally by some species and unknowingly by others. In a few cases a combination of natural and artificial causes have made it difficult to tell which one of these was responsible. The resulting 'domesticated' hybrid may then be an animal of unusual features or some unknown combination of both wild and domestic animals. Such hybrids have been called 'hybrids' or'strange/impure relatives'. Hybridisation is the process by which species of closely related but different species come into closer contact and interbreed, usually in captivity where the animals need to remain together in order to survive.

Habitat

To hybridise with another animal requires both species to co-exist for a number of years in close proximity. For example, when two wild-caught species of pheasant are introduced in a forest to raise chickens for bread, they will eventually reproduce together (1). Although the chickens will be in close contact with each other, by the time they reach a mature sexual age, the chicken will have mated with the pheasant and the hybrids are the result.

Hybridisation can also occur if two animals are brought together from different different habitats or even different species in a zoo and cross-pollinated each other's genes.

Human involvement

Although the term 'hybridisation', being used by scientists to describe the behaviour of humans, can sometimes be misleading, in practice it is best known as the deliberate introduction of two species into close contact, often to enhance the welfare, welfare, and health of the animals through captive breeding. Many people associate this with animal welfare and sometimes concern for the welfare of animal hybrids is invoked in relation to the welfare of hybrids themselves. However, although it may seem logical to assume that unwanted hybrids could be left in a zoo, by not keeping the animals in their natural habitat until they reach sexual maturity, in fact, it is not. When animals are brought into this environment, the hybrids usually will not be released to make room for the newly released wild animals.

In practice, it must be kept in mind that the animals are likely at least some
