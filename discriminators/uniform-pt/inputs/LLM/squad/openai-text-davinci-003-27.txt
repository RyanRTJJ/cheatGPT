resolved to resist. The Qing commander in chief Oboi accused Wu Sangui of treason and sent Li Ting and Li Yongfang to attack him. Li Ting and Li Yongfang were defeated by Wu Sangui's forces at Daxi and Changning in June 1673. The Manchu armies attacked the rebels again in October 1673 and were again defeated by Wu's forces at Congling and Diming. In November 1673, Huang Taiji personally intervened and led a 120,000-strong army against Wu Sangui and his allies. Wu and his forces were finally defeated near Yunnan in January 1674. 

Wu Sangui was captured, but ultimately pardoned by Emperor Huang Taiji on account of his former services to the Qing empire. Geng Zhongming and Shang Zhixin later accepted the emperor's pardon and surrendered, thus ending the rebellions that had begun in 1673. Wu Sangui returned to his post serving under the Qing and resumed loyal service to the emperor. 

Despite Wu Sangui’s pardon, the incidences of rebellion in southern China had a long-term impact on the Manchu control of the area. Wu’s rebellion and others like it set precedents for armed resistance to the Qing regime which would be followed during the rest of its rule.
