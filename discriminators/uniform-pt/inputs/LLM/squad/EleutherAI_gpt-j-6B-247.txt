Storylines

A long time ago in what was the Digital World, one of the Gods had died and caused a massive imbalance of power. The Digital World separated into the Real World, which was separated into many different parts and many different realms, and the Digital World, which was kept as one island. However, with the loss of their ruler and the continued imbalance, the Digital World has begun a decay, which causes the Digital World to disappear completely, killing most of the people inside it. The surviving people go underground to wait for the Digital World to return. They are eventually discovered by the Digital World Defense Commission, who uses technology to restore the Digital World. After much testing, the Digital World's Guardian Spirits are created, and the Digital World is now in balance once more.
