 resin, had emerged as the most practical for preserving fish.

Since that time, it has become a generic term for a non-coral species of polychaete worm commonly sold as mollusks of the order Heterobranchia, family Polynoidae. These can be found in different habitats, mostly in tropical (fresh water) and temperate (marine) regions, though their distribution ranges are wide including brackish seawater, freshwater lakes and rivers, estuaries, and saltwater lakes.

Pissasphalto is sold in large amounts in market as a preservation of fish but also to ensure a good tasting fish by adding caramel flavours to fish.

The market of pissasphalto is quite diverse including supermarkets, restaurants, fishmongers, markets, but also a hobbyist who does not mind to sell, often for a small profit.

A common myth says that pissasphalto is more important in North-America where there is an increase of freshwater in the last century due to massive water extractions as well as a large increase in agricultural areas.

In fact the situation is changing for the north to the north-east in Europe and there are numerous examples of ponds and lakes emptied by land-use change in Central, Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries.

Some ponds of Central Europe are connected to the Mediterranean and the north Atlantic and hence there is a high number of saltwater fish in the region which can survive as far north as Norway.

Many lakes and ponds of East Europe were artificially drained due to agriculture (fertiliser production) and industrial production (metal and electronic).

And last but not least there is the Mediterranean region which experienced important land cover changes at the beginning of the 20th century.
