 status of its own. For most philosophers, this ontological status is metaphysical.

The question is, does this ontological status carry with it a commitment to epistemological realism. The epistemological realist claims that knowledge, like truth, is something objective, in that the cognitive achievement is one for which we are genuinely responsible. For example, John has an actual experience of redness in his brain when he watches the sunset. He is aware of the experience, it is not fictional to him, and he can just as easily tell the experience to his friend as if she were there. No deception involved. He feels pain when he burns his hand, and at the same time knows that his hand burned; his pain and his knowledge are two distinct experiences. In every other case, there is a potential deception involved. We are not accountable for the ways in which our experiences are constructed, since this too is a creative process that depends on the imagination. However, we are always responsible for the contents of our experiences.

The problem

The problem for the realist, of course, is that it's very hard to come up with a plausible account of the ontology or nature of thought which also accepts the epistemic realism of the realist account. For example, if one accepts a kind of dualist ontology and holds that non-physical thought is epiphenomenal, then clearly the dualist is
