 eat prey ranging from arthropods (crustaceans) to small animals. Mammals have teeth, the two types of which are incisor and molars. Most species have incisors but some have also lost their incisors – those are the teeth that are worn down due to inactivity, and must be replaced in order to eat (see diagram).

The teeth have two elements, the crown & root

The tooth’s crown is a single thin, curved bone with two ridges that meet on the back of the tooth. Its root, or lateral bone, is where the tooth’s inner teeth are attached, and which is where they grow. The roots of incisors usually grow outward, whereas the roots of molars usually grow inward.

Because each tooth is unique, some animals also have specialised ‘toothed gums’ on the inside of their mouth. This is where the animal’s canine teeth are held, usually under the tongue. Dogs, for example, have these. Dogs don’t swallow their saliva, and so don’t need to retain the tooth in its socket, they only chew it; so they don’t need a protective gingival tissue.

Mammal teeth – an overview

The different types of teeth among mammals are illustrated on the diagram above. The following diagram illustrates all three incisor types.

Some animals have only one type of tooth, such as the kangaroos and wallabies, which have only molar teeth (the two to the right of the one on the bottom of the diagram). Or the kangaroo has just molar teeth, but has some incisors. Both occur in species that eat soft-tissue such as invertebrates and
