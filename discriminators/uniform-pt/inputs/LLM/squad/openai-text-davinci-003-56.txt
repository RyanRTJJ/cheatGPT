 originate from the Middle East, possibly from a single region, such as the Levant, or from wider areas of the Middle East, such as Mesopotamia and the Caspian Sea region.

The founder's effect of Jewish populations has been studied in multiple ways. Y-DNA models have been used to determine possible founding population sizes of Jewish populations. This technique has suggested that, in many cases, the founding populations coincided with what geneticists call "founder events" or a "genetic bottleneck," meaning that a relatively small number of male ancestors multiplied quickly, resulting in a population with similar genetic characteristics.

Studies of autosomal DNA have also suggested that there was a small founding population that expanded quickly. These studies have revealed an increased frequency of certain alleles in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, which is thought to be due to the founder effect of such a small founding population. Population genetic studies have also revealed that Jewish populations share similar genetic characteristics, indicating a small founder population from which the larger Jewish populations we know today originated.
