 of play. Each side of the pitch can contain 13 coaches, each of whom have a position relative to the rest of their team. When the ball has been played to the other side of the pitch, the ball is carried back to a bench and taken to a referee's official station. When no-one is on the bench in a stoppage of play, the whistle is blown on the end of the game.

In some countries, half-time kicks off immediately instead of at half-time. The game resumes again when the whistle blows. In many countries, halves also consist of the entire match: it might be the first half, the second half, the first half of the third quarter, the third quarter of the fourth quarter, the second half of the game, the fourth quarter and the start of the fifth quarter. In these circumstances, all the players who have been playing remain on the pitch until all the teams are finished, after which the match is stopped and the play recommences.

Many sports, such as basketball, ice hockey and handball, also have a semi-normal half-time break to allow the players to change clothes, prepare for the next session and so on. In these sports, the halves are also not the same length as they are in football: in handball, for example, the halves last 30 minutes and in basketball they last 20.
