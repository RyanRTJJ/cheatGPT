acks a person in the forehead. For instance, according to the asymmetric-causation argument, the finger could have been at a non-convenient point on the cup due to which when it hit the forehead it could not have struck just below the eyebrows. But a causal chain of events cannot go non-conveniently. It should be convenient either for an agent to realize a given thing or for an event to occur. Similarly, for a particular object or event, there is not non-arbitrary constraint which could be satisfied for it to occur otherwise when it does occur. Moreover, such arguments also overlook the fact that they are always directed towards something, such as an agent or an event. This is also important, for they require one to argue that agents might have done otherwise, that they could have been different from what they were, etc. But the reason is that there is always a need to make sense of the past and the future in order to provide explanation for things which happen. One cannot claim the past does not exist without providing cause and effect for it. When a causal chain is used to provide explanation for the occurrence of one event following another, it is not a causal chain but what has happened. If one cannot claim the past does not exist, then one cannot say that different things could have happened otherwise, that a
