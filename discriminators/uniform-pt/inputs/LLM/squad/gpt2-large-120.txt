 approximately 2,500 years and a variety of different memory systems. Indeed, although we know almost nothing about the precise processes underlying memory we do, on a collective level, know how they can be subserved by different mechanisms in the brain. A detailed account of these molecular processes is beyond the scope of this book, but suffice it to say that in summary they can be broken down into two basic mechanisms, both of which operate in the hippocampus, including memory consolidation, consolidation of spatial/temporal memories, and the maintenance of long-term memory. The main mechanisms (see Figure) are discussed in an integrated fashion which allows the user to draw the major general principles at the molecular level. Finally, a comparison of the different memory systems is included which reveals the underlying functional relations. (See Figure.) It is hoped that the book can serve as a useful resource as a reference or guide for prospective researchers, and a valuable guide to the more general concepts which have been developed in this book to explain the biology of information and memory.

The History of Memory in Brain and Behavior

The molecular mechanisms underlying all the memory systems in the brain, including those in the hippocampus, have been reviewed in earlier publications in the field of memory. (For the best available references, see Cited References.) However, none of these publications has discussed any detail until now. While many of the concepts in the recent discussion of memory are
