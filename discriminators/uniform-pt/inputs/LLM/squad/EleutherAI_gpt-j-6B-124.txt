The relay in Athens featured a very important historic event for European sport and democracy: the torch was carried by the Greek basketball team, which set the record for the highest number of medal finishers in a single day in the history of the Olympic Games; and on May 2, this became the most number of medals for any single sports event in a single day in the history of the modern Olympic movement, with 17 gold or silver medals (see Athens 2004). Another symbolic point was made on April 9 at the Olympic Stadium through the arrival of the Olympic flame. In it was the first flame of the XXIst century which symbolizes the start of the 21st century. The flame, carried by former Olympians, athletes and world famous sportsmen, is believed to lead to a new world of harmony and peace.
