.26 million household households with an average annual income of Rs. 1,500, and an unemployment rate of 3.5%, but the city is not one of the four poorest in India.

To be sure, much of the population is living a lower life of desperation and misery. A 2014 report by Maithripala Sirisena, director general of Public Health of the Indian Union, revealed that between 2012 and 2014 India witnessed a "dramatic uptick in low birth, low birth-related infant mortality [NCRIM] [and] neonatal deaths". In the 2012-2014 period, the UNDP noted a decline in NCDs from 4.3 million to 2.7 million in India, partly due to a move from a "child-centric" to a "citizen-centric" approach to health care delivery. But despite a move away from infant mortality, the NCD crisis worsened, while NCDs in India have still not returned to pre-reform levels.

According to the Global Cities Report 2015 (available at http://www.globaldirectors.com/2015/09/globally-unemployment-and-poverty-is-an-alarming-number-as-global-cities-set-for-sustainability-report-finds), "The rate of poverty and unemployment has risen in urban areas in recent years" and the "urban employment was highest in developed countries".

One reason for these urban unemployment rates are the many unskilled and semi-skilled jobs that do not require university degrees. "It is the nature of the work that is difficult and unskilled, and you can fall into destitution if you don't have money to fund your education," said Shashi Pandey from The World Bank.
