 to watch films while remaining strapped in a wheel chair. Schachter thought it impossible for one drug to cause both pain and calmness. But an English surgeon called Walter Baring studied epinephrine-induced relaxation in rats after applying it to spinal injuries. Schachter concluded that Baring's rats experienced pleasure.

If Baring's rats were having more fun than humans in their wheel chairs, Schachter wondered how they got out of them. That question intrigued the Swiss neuroscientist Robert Lanza, who began systematically studying rats sitting in wheels, as well as those perched on an elevated board attached to a motor cycle and a wooden pole with holes where their legs would have been. These rodents (Lanza dubbed them "wheel rats") were less likely than standard rats to suffer the pain and restlessness caused by immobilization.

In the 1970s, Lanza noticed that, in rats confined to wheel chairs, they became much less likely to scratch their heads, lick their balls or otherwise engage in the typical rat behaviour. "People had suspected something, but it was just one observation," he says. "Now we found that it was trueâ€”that rats who were in wheel chairs don't do many rat things."

And what they do do, Lanza noticed, is have fun. "The rats play and explore a lot more," he says. "They run around, roll on the floor, scratch their backs."

For some time, Schachter and his graduate student,
