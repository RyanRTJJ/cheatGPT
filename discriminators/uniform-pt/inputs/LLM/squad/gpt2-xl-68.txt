 between the east and the west with the creation of the Autobahn, which linked the west with the north-west. Today many roads remain cut from the old motorway lines, but there are now only a few miles of the original motorway. The other motorways, however, show the history of motorways, especially the A4 motorway and the A6 motorway.

The A4 was born in 1909 as a replacement for the existing A3 highway network, which was in need of major renovation during the First World War. Constructed by two companies, the West German state of Schleswig-Holstein agreed for both companies to have exclusive designs. This meant that the entire system was planned as one system, rather than two separate networks. Both companies received public funding, but were required to spend a portion of their resources developing their systems.

The West German state of Schleswig-Holstein also offered the two companies £400,000 in government bonds to build parts of the infrastructure at their own expense. In return, they were allowed to build the entire system. In the east, plans were also put into place, including the creation of the 'Höhe' region, from the village of Hanau to the railway station Neunkirchen in western Germany. As a result, the A4 was established in the east, the A3 to the west and the A1 to the north-west.

The West German government also made plans to run a national motorway network from Cologne to Rostock by 1926.

The A4, which has a length of 2,073 miles, began operating from 1920. Over the next 20 years, it grew into the largest motorway network in
