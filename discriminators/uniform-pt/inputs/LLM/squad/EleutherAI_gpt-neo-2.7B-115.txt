ppella movements were generally of religious in nature, such as the madrigal, which could be performed without a single instrument. Gradually, these early Christian compositions took a more secular form in which voices of each of three or more kinds were combined in harmony and sung or chanted by an ensemble of instruments. This kind of music was referred to by the Italian Jesuit composer Vincenzo Galilei as "composita oratione," which is now the preferred English translation. The most famous composer of this kind of music was the Englishman John Taverner (1479-1536).

The first compositional forms based on a kind of polyphony that came to be known as chorale movement were largely instrumental in nature. It consisted of a chorus of a different instrument or voices joined in a harmony by means of a chord, as in the basso continuo. The first known chorale movement appears to have been called "The Last Song before the Death of Jesus Christ." It is mentioned in a manuscript from around 1490 referred to as the Oratio Ad Sanctis Crucis, or simply Adeo Christi, but scholars are now divided as to whether it dates to or before 1485. As the music developed, other compositional forms became popular, in particular the hymns sung by the laity. (John Taverner also wrote several hymn melodies which would not have been written for solo singers.) The two chorales mentioned above may have been inspired by Taverner's use of the chorale forms in his compositions for mixed choir.

The chorales of Taverner were arranged for solo singers between 1512 and 1519, and became widespread in England. This was also followed by the widespread use of motets by English composers, whose popularity was revived during the later 1530s by composers like Thomas Tallis. The chorales in England and other European countries were adapted to new
