 who may attack them or chase them away.

Another aspect of the predator-prey hierarchy in butterflies is the role of their competitors. Although many butterflies and moths have rivals for life, they are not always successful. The competition is based on the size of a competitor, especially the size of the predator. Usually, a rival species cannot grow large enough to do the job, so the larger the predator, the easier the job is. Even if the competitor's size is not large enough to handle the predator, it cannot survive as a competitor. The prey, on the other hand, can be no larger than would be necessary to do the job. Both animals are prey, and in turn receive their power from the prey.

The blue jay lives in a large forest in the United States where it feeds on various insects, and where it is able to prey on larger predators than other species. The blue jay's main rival is the mountain lion, but these two prey are also competitors, and also compete with each other. Other species rival with it in some other way, but only the largest predator can handle a predator sized competitor.

Bluejays live alone for several seasons in their young life. They begin their courtship as small, pale blue orbs with orange legs, about 0.6 inches high, and very yellow inside. They remain small until about 2 weeks of age, when they begin to grow larger as they mature. They are very inquisitive and quick to learn, and when they are older
