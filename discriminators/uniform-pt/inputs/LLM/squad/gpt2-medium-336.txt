-34s, T-55s, and T-52s) that had passed him about ten kilometers (six miles) before.

On 28 October, after passing through a small village called Jicarilla near the village of San Carlos, Kurita, his crew, and the tanker BAMAGURA were sent to the rescue of a man named Ríos Báez.

At 11:13 p.m., when Kurita and his BAMAGURA were taking fuel from the Cementin refinery, the tanker, T-34-72S, was shot on approach by the enemy fighters. Kurita, Báez, and the other crew members landed the tanker in the field where the enemy fighters appeared. Because the enemy fighters were flying T-38s, Kurita was instructed to shoot down six of the enemy planes with bombs, which destroyed two of the attackers. The remaining four landed in an area under attack from the enemy and were shot down by torpedoes. Báez, having been hit by an AK-47 round, came out of the sky, having dropped fifty and thirty-five pounds of ammunition, onto Kurita and the rest of his crew.

While the others got up and escaped from the burning tanker (with Báez and the remaining four remaining fighters), Báez returned fire in self-defense from the two BAMAGURA MiGs that attacked him. He was gunned down by the T-44s of BAMAGURA. When the T-34s left Báez's location, Kurita directed his crew to attack the remaining enemy fighters. On the move at 11:22 a.m., Kurita, Báez and the remaining crew members attempted to return to Báez's position, but that turned out to be too dangerous, as the enemy fighters were circling over the area. Kurita and the MiGs were almost destroyed by the time they reached the town of Ilam. They landed behind a town line, to be surrounded for one hour by the F-16s of the 4th Air Force, who had joined Kurita and Báez's attack.
