During World War I, Raymond built a house that combined functional and artistic elements, according to current tastes, which consisted of large windows and open areas, as he wanted to see the outside.
The house is composed of two buildings, divided by an atrium in the center and separated by a set of doors.
The lower floor consists of a dining room and a kitchen.

For the rest of his life he
