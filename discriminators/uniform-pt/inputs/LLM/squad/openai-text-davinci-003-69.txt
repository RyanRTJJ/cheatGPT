 Understanding a new epistemology known as empiricism. Proponents of empiricism argued that knowledge was based on experience, and that rationalism, in taking abstract intellectual processes as a source of knowledge, overemphasized the role of logic in understanding the world.

Locke argued that sense perception, experience, and reflection should provide the basis for ideas and beliefs. He claimed that knowledge of nature could be accumulated by the accumulation of experience. He based this idea on the fact that simple ideas can add up to form more complex knowledge, an idea that was later taken up by David Hume and empiricists of the time. Locke also laid out his epistemological views in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding and brought it to the world of philosophy.

Locke's beliefs are an important part of empiricism, which suggests that knowledge comes only through experience. Whereas rationalism relies on prior knowledge and logical deduction, empiricists contend that our knowledge is based on experience that is accumulated over time. Empiricists proposed that learning from experience was the best way to gain accurate knowledge of the world. By contrast, Campbell and Descartes' theories of knowledge assumed that knowledge was preexisting in the mind, and could be acquired through intuition or deduction. Locke introduced a third way of understanding knowledge based upon an individualâ€™s observations of the world. He emphasised the importance of gathering observations in order to draw conclusions, suggesting that knowledge can be acquired through observation, reflection and experimentation.
