ponsible for, among other duties, performing religious ceremonies, interpreting the meaning of natural phenomena and events, praying, teaching and serving as a spiritual leader of the people. The priest was often a conduit through which the state communicated and involved the gods in its decisions.

The duties and privileges of a public priest varied depending on the context. In Rome, a public priest was expected to oversee all matters related to the care of state shrines, ceremonies, festivals and sacrifices. He was also responsible for maintaining the sacred boundaries of the city, deciding on the legitimacy of foreign cults and gods, issuing legal decrees on religious matters, and serving as a judge to hear religious disputes. In other parts of the Roman Empire, a public priest could serve as a leader of local religious communities, interpret oracles and omens, prepare and offer sacrifices, and represent the interests of the local population before state and local authorities. In each case, a public priest had the authority to advise and make decisions in religious matters, and was an important source of moral leadership within a society.
