 King of England in the days of Queen Elizabeth I did not exercise the same powers of rule over both England and Ireland that his son, the King James I, now exercised over both England and Scotland upon coming to the Throne of England. That in turn opened up possibilities for conflict, or worse, between the two realms.
The most significant cause of difference between the two countries was religion. Scotland was a Catholic country, while England was a Protestant country. This meant no religious services could take place in Scotland in English churches, and no members from either country could enter the other country's services without giving up membership. Also, there were no Catholic clergy in Scotland, although England had a priest (with a few parishioners) to serve Irish Catholics before they could settle there.
This was a relatively small problem, and it was eventually managed quite smoothly as people learned to tolerate each other's differences, and to understand that each country did not dictate the other's lifestyle or beliefs. This did not last, of course, and in 1606 James I made a decision to bring all religions into the Church of England. In doing so he also closed the Scottish churches against any Catholic worship.
