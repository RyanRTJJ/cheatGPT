 Yugoslavia and was elected as the president of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. The country was split into six zones. The communists in the first six zones came from all over Croatia and had an economic policy of "peace and prosperity" and "peaceful unification".

Togo, Montenegro and Serbia are the communist countries in the West. The other two countries, Montenegro and Serbia, support each other financially, have a similar economic policy and live in a semi-conflict region.

Tonga, the most prosperous province of the former Soviet Union under the communist regime of Viktor Orbán, was a part of Yugoslavia for nearly three years from 1991 until 1991 and was awarded a permanent status as a Communist state in 1995 based on the number of its membership in the USSR. The former Soviet Union ceased to exist in 1995 during Article 21 of the Warsaw Pact Treaty. The communist Soviet Union did not join the Warsaw Pact in 1999 nor was it incorporated into NATO until October 1999. A new Soviet Union was formed after the fall of Communism in 1989. At the time, Yugoslavia had three members: the Republic of Moldova, the Republic of Romania, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Serbia.
