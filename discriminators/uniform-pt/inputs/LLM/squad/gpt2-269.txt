 of the ground is often covered with a thick thick layer of silica, resulting in some vegetation that is quite different from that found in most high-altitude locations. The southern fringe of the ground contains various kinds of shrubs, which contain the essential ingredient of carbon dioxide (CO2) in abundance. The shrubs are most commonly seen around early summer and during the early spring. Several kinds of trees, such as pine, holly and fir, are also common plants in the area and the forests are usually very active during the day. As the temperature of the air rises in the warmer parts of the day, the vegetation becomes even more dense, making it easier to stay cooler in the higher elevations where they have a more uniform vegetation pattern. The vegetation also grows in the more inhospitable regions, such as in the eastern areas of the region. The forests as a whole, are much more active in the day compared to the other parts of the desert area, as they are open from the ground to provide shelter from the cold. At times during the day rainfall ranges from very low in the northern and southern fringes of the desert to almost non-existent over the central and the eastern part.
