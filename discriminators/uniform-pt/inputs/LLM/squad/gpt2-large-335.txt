, the reference population was the Khazarian-Semitic population, which is the most closely related to the Druze population. In effect, the Khazarian-Semitic reference population was the source, and the Druze population is therefore the source of the Druze ancestors. Therefore, the Druze, according to the Bible and Islam, are not descendants of the ancient Khazars, but descendents of the Khazarian people. There is therefore no evidence that the Khazar-Semitic genes are unique to the Khazars. The Druze can be classified as either of two groups, the Khazars of Russian-speaking (Eastern Europe). These Khazarians came to central and western Europe following the fall of the Roman Empire, and it is this genetic influence that explains the genetic structure of modern Druze, Druze-speaking and Druze-Arabic populations. Genetic evidence that the Khazars are a separate and independent group from other Caucasian populations has been found from the Russian Caucasus, in particular the Caucasus, as well as the Black Sea area and the Black Sea peninsula. The data of this study and the data of the earlier studies show also that the Khazar-Khazarian group diverged many times and is quite different from the other Caucasian groups. It still belongs to the same subgroup of the Caucasian people (Caucasic, Caucasian-Russian, Caucasian-Caucasian-Georgian or Caucasian-Armenian), but it is a distinct branch, which is not an "ancient" group.

We consider that the Khazars belonged to a different branch of Caucasians.

Genetic structure of the Khazar group

Based on a combination of analyses and the data of geneticists, it is obvious that the Khazar group is genetically
