 delivery speed than broadband for their customers. Despite this report on the Commission's Web site, it did not come into effect until December 31, 2015.

Broadband delivery speed

Broadband delivery speed can be defined as "the number of times a particular speed can be achieved in a given amount of time." It can also be compared to how much of a difference in speed this speed may affect at a different location relative to a connection with a "similar speed" connection (the typical internet connection is 2 Mbps). The FCC uses a 5 Mbps "broadband delivery speed" metric in its published regulations or guidelines. The metric is not based on how quickly a link is delivered; more generally, broadband delivery speed is what users can get in a given amount of time (within some geographical limitations as discussed in the FCC's blog post on "Regulation of Internet access."

When the Internet was conceived, "broadband delivery speed" was associated with fixed cables (not the new high-speed internet connections made for smartphones today). A lot has changed in the broadband delivery era, including the fact that fast internet connections require much higher infrastructure costs as well as higher data rates. Some technologies – such as those used by mobile operators – now seem to be obsolete, while others are still new in their introduction and need improvement.
