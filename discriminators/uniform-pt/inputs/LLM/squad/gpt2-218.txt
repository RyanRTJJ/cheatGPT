 this period. The people of Ireland remained in the Isles in the Middle Ages (9th century BC â€“ 6th century AD) while the inhabitants and the tribes of Great Britain gradually became more independent. They made up three groups: Celtic Americans, Picts and Britons. A group of groups called the Picts had a long history, from the beginning of the 8th century AD. While this may have started with their association with Britain and Wales, such association probably ended when the Picts, the chief people of the island (and the ancestral people of Ireland), disappeared, following widespread attacks against them. Following this in 1789, the Picts and the Irish returned, leaving Scotland as a separate people called the Picts. The Picts were responsible for the rise of Britain to power in the 13th century. Between the 13th century, they were a part of the Great Irish Wars, under the control of the King of the Pictes, his men and others, who invaded all areas of Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Picts defeated the Great Irish of Ireland who had captured much of Ireland and were soon joined by the Picts in power. At the end of 1649, the first American soldier, William Jackson, was chosen to serve on the U.S. War College of Fort Sumter (see map below) on the island of Ireland. After this, he received a fellowship with Sir John White, a French officer and explorer, and a commission as war lieutenant of the Great Irish War
