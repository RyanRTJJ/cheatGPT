 Thus the concept of _practical reason_, however much it might depend on a concept of freedom in that reason, is, for the most part, a concept independent of freedom. For he does not accept that it is in freedom that _practical_ reason can be found, because, first of all, freedom is a free act of will and the will of all beings is constrained. If there were no constraints there would be no will. Since will is an essential concept of practical reason (though also of theoretical reason), the practical concept of freedom is, for him, derived _a priori_ from moral law as such as well as from freedom as such. There would be no freedom if there were not a will. If a will is willed as an act willed, then 'we cannot get up and _will_ without willing ourselves' and, so, _we are_ practical reason as practical will for the ethical world. That a finite being, an actual human being, is in the ethical world a willed being, a practical reason, is, for him, an intrinsic part of'man as a _moral_, rational being'.

I should try to do justice to all this, but what exactly should I do? I am convinced that _the_ essential task of philosophy is to clarify for itself the concepts upon which its own truth depends. It will seem, then, that I now have to distinguish between an analytic and a synthetic task in philosophy when it
