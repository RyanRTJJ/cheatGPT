a machine made of wood and metal pipe) which was connected to the plough using a connection plate and a water pump. The first conductor would run a cable from one side of an existing tramway to the other side and use an electric current to supply the new pole. To charge the pump, a cable from the plough to the water pump supplied a high voltage current that was also coupled to a low (alternating) current. The water powered the water pump, and the water was pumped back under the tram where it discharged the overhead supply and was directed downstream to the second conductor. The third conductor supplied the third-rail current during the first half of the ride (or when the second and third conductor were operating).

Asphalt roads: The plough would also work as a road plough, which would allow the pavement to pass through, but with only occasional failures in connecting the two. The current, on foot, would not normally be available unless the road had many side-chains. It is believed that the first route had a low overhead current, but its failure rates were probably considerably lower than in today's plough roads.

In modern rail systems, the two wires would share the same conduit third-rail current collector. The current from the plough to its pumping station and other power points at the tram would flow around on a separate current line, on an overhead trolley, as shown in the diagram above. This was achieved by first carrying a plough into a building then replacing the main current conductor, the third conductor. A third-rail current of sufficient current to keep a street-track from running was also carried into the plough, at
