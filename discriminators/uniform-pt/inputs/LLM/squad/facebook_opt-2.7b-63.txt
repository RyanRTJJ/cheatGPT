 series of biological experiments on everything from rats to rabbits." Some of the experiments used the bodies of prisoners as "guinea pigs."

"They're testing a lot of things out, particularly in the United States, you know, biological and chemical weapons," says former U.S. Army officer Bill Cooper. "It's one of the things they're trying to combat, because of what happened in World War II."

Cooper was part of a team that researched an outbreak of meningitis among U.S. servicemen during World War II. After a series of experiments on thousands of soldiers, they found that many men had come down with "an immune disease. It turned out it was a disease that went around their body. You know, not one person got up and it was completely gone. It was an epidemic."

Cooper explains that by taking blood samples, lab doctors could learn more about the disease that was so deadly to American troops. They were able to identify certain factors that may help develop a vaccine to prevent the disease.

"It was such a great way to keep our soldiers healthy," he says.

"They did discover a number of things, which is why they really wanted to try it out again on a larger scale," Cooper adds.

In 2002, a British government report estimated that up to 150,000 people in the United Kingdom were infected with
