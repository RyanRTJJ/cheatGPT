 was going to be priced around $150.00 to $175.00, and would be available at all major retailers, including big name retailers like Target, Walmart, Big Lots, etc. Now that it's been over a year since that show, we're finally going to get some info as well as release info on the PS3 Slim at E3 in June.

Sony is currently planning a "miniaturized" version of the PS3 "Slim" for release around Fall/Winter 2012. This would be priced between $150 and $175, which is right in between the old model and CECH-4000.

I've been expecting the new PS3 design to come sometime in the next 12-18 months because Sony said that they'd start development this fall.

Sony has put out at least three generation-defining platforms during my lifetime (PS1, PS2, PSP) as well as a couple of mobile platforms, so when they release a PS3 redesign I tend to assume that it will be the best one yet. So we won't have to wait long to find out.

There is another potential change though that we know that the company is working through. It's been a well-known problem that many PS3 owners have had with excessive vibrations and low noise, and while the new design may address some of the issue, it might not.

We have already seen the PS3 Slim's case for the
