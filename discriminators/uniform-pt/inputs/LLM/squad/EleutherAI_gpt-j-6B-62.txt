 29 BC. The poem is a tribute to the pastoral poetry of Arcadia and of the Latin poets Ennius, Tibullus, and Propertius. Its main themes include friendship, the value of home life, the transience of happiness and the importance of the mind.

Aspects of Arcadian poetry influenced Lucan (AD 37–68), Statius (AD 45–96), and perhaps Horace (65–8?), while its influence on Ovid (62–17) was important. Virgil’s style has a powerful simplicity which is often associated with great art, but it is also regarded as a kind of Latin “barbarism” not unlike the Homeric poetry it is modelled on. The text of the Eclogues was translated and adapted by Boethius (AD 483-524), and it was also translated into both Old Norse and Hebrew. This long poetic sequence provided an artistic vehicle for the poet’s philosophical concepts of natural processes, natural limits, and human happiness. It was also an important text for medieval scholars who used it for theological and philosophical studies. More than six hundred manuscripts, some of which were copied many hundreds of years after the composition of the Eclogues, survive. In the second century AD, a school of neo-Latin elegiac writers adopted many of Virgil’s themes and forms and produced the Eclogues of Messala Corvinus.

The Bucolic tradition was revived in the late 16th century as a major literary genre in Italy. It was a reaction against the literary and philosophical interests of Petrarch (1304–74), who had adopted the Tuscan language and style of Dante (1265–1321). At the dawn of the 18th century, Italian critics attempted to produce an Italian pastoral literature to rival the hexameter Bucolics. They wrote of “Bucolismo,” which was often used to refer to a particular style, a certain kind of literature. Later developments in Roman Catholicism in the next century led to an even greater appreciation of rural life, which was sometimes presented with an emphasis on the joy of agricultural life.
