 the 1987 album of the same name. This was followed by the much-lauded 1987 album by Black Sabbath, Lords of Blood. This album is perhaps their most successful and is widely regarded as one of the worst efforts by the group. Both albums were instrumental prog rock, which was at that point still highly regarded by many as being the pinnacle of prog rock. The combination of the two albums was an instant success. In 1988, the band announced their first studio album, Machine Head for the Amiga, which they had originally planned to release on the BBC format, but the decision to launch the album in the US was a huge factor in the album's commercial success. After this release, Deep Purple's music was regularly played on the radio in the US, and this success was not just limited to the US market â€“ the album became the first non-US platinum selling prog rock album.

The 1990s saw another wave of revival, with the release of a series of albums by Alice Cooper, Megadeth, Anthrax, Metallica, Megadeth, KISS, Alice Cooper, and Alice Cooper's Metal Machine Music (1988). This time the albums produced by the newly-formed Megadeth were hugely influenced by the prog-rock of Pink Floyd. In 1991, the band released their fifth studio album entitled Super Collider. The album contained three previously-unreleased tracks on the new Pink Floyd album, Dark Side of the Moon. This album was a commercial disaster, selling only 350,000
