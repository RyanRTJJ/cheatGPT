 take over all military units of the state. While they are fighting the war against Shang Rong's forces, Sun Zi's nephew Sun Lüsi (sunli), a loyal subject of the rebel government, is tricked into revealing the location of the family's base. Sun Lüsi is later captured or killed.

When the rebellion is over, the imperial court declares Shang Rong and Wu Sangui rebels, and Sun Zhongming, Shang Kexi, and Shang Zhixin all "traitors against the empire." The court sentences the rebel leaders to death. However, the warlord Gao Yiju (kang) later pardons all rebels.

 Sun Zi's biography 

The biography of Sun Zi, the main character of the text, is largely taken from other classical sources and other ancient writings. He was supposedly the son of a prince, and as noted above, his own biographer Sun Shao was one official working with the emperor Jin. His father, Sun Hao, was a minor prince but was elevated to nobility after the death of his father. Sun Zi (d. 400 BC), along with his son and successor Sun Ce, served two non-consecutive terms as a chief (jujiang wang) of Jinshui (now Jingzhou) County on the border of present-day southwestern Gansu Province and northwestern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region during the Spring and Autumn period. During the Western Zhou, Sun Zi served the King of Wu (r. 1046-1045 BC) as a prime minister (junwang, 簡王). Sun Zi's biography also mentions Sun Wu (wuzu) and Sun Shao, who is also mentioned in Sunzi. These figures are often depicted as Sun Zi's contemporaries but are almost certainly fictional, since they were historical figures; Sun Wu, for example, ruled about 1100 BC, hundreds-of-years before his supposed contemporary Sun Zi.
