icularly susceptible to certain antigens, such as those from animal danders and pollens. Neonates tend to have an immature immune system, causing them to have a weaker response to antigens than a person of any other age. Without maternal antibodies, neonates have a harder time mount an immune response.

When antigens enter the body, the body responds by releasing antibodies, or B cells, or by activating T cells, which are responsible for the mobilization of other cells to protect the body from the antigen. Depending on the location of the antigen, the body will alert different types of cells. For example, when an antigen is presented on the surface of a cell, the body will alert B cells that recognize the antigen and will activate the release of antibodies. This will then trigger the production of proteins called cytokines that cause the immune response. 

In addition to antibody and T-cell responses, the body can also produce a response called cell-mediated immunity, which allows for the activation of other cells in the body to attack the antigen. In this case, the body's reaction is more focused on attacking the antigen directly, as opposed to an antibody-mediated response which produces antibodies to bind the antigen and then neutralize it. 

Finally, the body can also produce an inflammatory response to an antigen. In this case, the body will alert inflammatory cells to the presence
