 dogs and cats to shoot the animals from the back or side of the hunting area. The animals are often attacked by small dogs because people will try to follow them.

A hunter aims a rifle at an individual animal but cannot see that the animal is attacking him or her. The hunter must go back and reload the gun. A hunter can only see at-fault the gun if the animal is not moving quickly.

The only animals that are shot from the rear of the hunting area are game birds, mules, hounds, or cattle and they have no other rights to be shot at.

There is an active tradition of hunting of small and medium game at the Trinidad and Tobago Game and Fish Museum. The conservation organisation has developed a Wildlife Protection Act to protect both animals and birds. Conservation areas of the museum are monitored by the State Wildlife Foundation and by local government agencies.

Birds are restricted in the wild because of their size and their hunting capacity. There are also no protection for the small and medium game birds in protected areas. The state wildlife foundation also gives conservation permits, to animals under 18 years of age, in areas of endemic wildlife such as the Río Dío National Park or to endangered species, to the highest level possible.

There are a number of hunting areas, but they are not as big as those listed in the Wildlife Protection Act, and there are areas where hunting can still be a good idea. More or less, this is the case for all the other areas on the list.

Hiking

Birds are considered to be naturally omnivorous, having very sharp and aggressive claws, an extremely efficient hunting weapon, and have an exceptionally short life expectancy.

Hunting can be very challenging for birds as they are very difficult to control from the outside. However, due to the natural variation of birds being able to survive in different habitats, they sometimes find new ways to defend themselves and their homes and other places, to make their own escape from predators to avoid being picked off (by a predator), and to escape when predators turn on them. A number of large, aggressive birds have successfully evaded detection or other animal patrols, often because of the very sharp claws they use to beat at the prey.
