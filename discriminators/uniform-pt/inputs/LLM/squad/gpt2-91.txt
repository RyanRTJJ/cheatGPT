 all of the possible states of that state. His next target in the laboratory is what a computer program known as Pulsed Quantum Entanglement (PQEA) could do.

But what about the next big problem?

"I wouldn't want to talk about that for now," Feynman says. "But it's certainly a real problem. There's some very interesting properties of what we've been discovering that are being described, but as far as we know everything is a simulation experiment, which you just don't do."

"There's a real problem with it, because the universe is full of variables and the simulation doesn't really get a handle on them. These observations and conclusions are just an exercise in taking one experiment and trying to make a model of what could happen in the future, and then running it through multiple generations of simulations, not understanding the details of how the changes change at any particular moment in time, and being concerned instead with how do things fit together when a change happens to them."

As quantum physics has become more mainstream, the possibilities for prediction have become more and more remote. But at least one recent experiment has shown that simulation could also be a way of modeling problems and providing a practical method for resolving them, says Feynman, who is now assistant professor of physics at Emory University. "When we could simulate a situation in which all these variables were interacting, it would be very natural and elegant to do that," he says.

As quantum mechanics continues to learn, it will be fascinating
