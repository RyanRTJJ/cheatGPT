itation needed] Thus he could have been an actual student of the Martyrs of the Great persecution, and a student of this school was St. Basil. St. Basil was a student of the Athenian Academy.[6] It is possible that the Athenian Academy was established in the fourth century, after the time of the Martyrs of the Great Persecutions, and there is some evidence of Christian knowledge in Athens at this time.[6] However, even if Basil established the school in Athens, he must have gone to Asia Minor, if he was a student there, for he taught in the city of Caesarea in Cappadocia, and died at Hieropolis Magna, also in Cappadocia.[6]

One of the earliest surviving Christian writers and also a student of Basil, and later another of the two of the best known Greek theologians of antiquity, is Athanasius (died c. 373).[6] He wrote many letters and one full-length biography of "St. Anthony the Great".[7] Other notable students of Basil include the Latin writers Gregory Nazianzus (c. 335 - 345â€“386),[8] Ambrose (340-397 CE),[8] Jerome (347-420 CE),[8][9] and Ambrosius (345-397 CE).[10] Athanasius was himself a teacher of Augustine, Jerome, and Basil.[8][11][12] Athanasius's works include his famous two books Against the Pagans, where he gives his view of the state of Christianity at the time of Emperor Constantine's Edict of Milan in 313.[8][13][14]
