 and chief clerk of the House of Commons stand behind the Speaker's Chair in the center of Parliament where he will declare Parliament officially dissolved.

Parliament is formally dissolved by the Sovereign upon the advice of the Prime Minister, on the advice of the Privy Council or (in cases where the sovereign is under age) by letters patent issued by the crown, for example in the case of Queen Elizabeth II, the sovereign under age at the time of the dissolution. When Parliament is dissolved, its business ends, and the Sovereign appoints new members of Parliament and a new House of Commons, after which the Queen's Speech is approved and the new Parliament, as the sovereign's chosen and elected representatives, is constituted. The process usually follows this pattern:

The Queen dissolves Parliament formally (by making a speech)

The Queen appoints the new prime minister (who must be elected by members of the House of Commons)

Parliament is formally dissolved

The Queen's Speech is accepted by the new Parliament and Parliament is officially dissolved

The Queen appoints the new prime minister of the Queen's choice from amongst those members who have been elected during the process

Parliament is formally dissolved

The Queen makes a speech to inaugurate the new Parliament

The Queen sends the appropriate letters patent to the local authorities for the dissolution of Parliament

On the day when the queen dissolves parliament, the monarch usually delivers a televised address to the nation on state affairs and/or makes a radio broadcast.
