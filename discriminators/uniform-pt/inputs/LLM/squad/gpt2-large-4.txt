. It's one month in December and one month in January. (Note that, unlike in the NHL, preseason games don't count towards a team's regular-season schedule). Players must dress for at least five of the nine preseason regular-season games.

What's more, it's also a long, hard schedule. To compete, teams will probably spend a week training, one week scrimmaging, and a couple of weeks trying to prepare for the upcoming season. As players accumulate experience, they can earn bonuses. In the 2005 draft, for example, there was a bonus for every game for which an NHL player played. Teams must use the bonus each year to determine their starting lineups, and to prepare their rosters for the upcoming season.

The NFL does allow players to sit out a handful of preseason games, but only those that are to be played prior to a week in September. This is not typical practice for NFL players. Because of this, it's been easier for players to be suspended from the regular regular season because of these suspended games. The NFLPA's lawsuit against the league, which was filed less than a week before the 2007 season began, claimed that because of the "rigidity" of the preseason schedule, players were unable to prepare for the game after the weeklong practices that were standard practice for a full professional football team. But at the time, the only league rule directly addressing preseason training was what was termed "Week In, Week Out" training, in which players practiced on weekdays only. Thus, the NFL did nothing to address or alter the "rigidity" of the way players were scheduled during pre-season (the same approach the NFLPA took.) NFL teams can only choose to take one week off during training camp, so they would have had to work a week if they wanted any flexibility. The
