The Bleacher Bums, according to MLB, are those who play through a game and then spend another hour or so yelling at the net, cursing at their hosts, or just watching the game. (I've heard one of them accuse the Cubs of being "a cesspool that no longer serves our community.")

That is in spite of the fact that "Bleacher Bums" have been playing baseball in Chicago since the mid-1990s. And for those wondering: That has not been illegal. The Chicago Cubs are one of a number of MLB teams to be accused of a racial slur toward fans in the bleacher section.

This seems to have originated out of the fact that the league would like to host a game at Wrigley Field, but a stadium was not available by the start of the 2010 season. The league sent a memo asking bleacher fans to come up with new names for themselves, and one player's response to the league's request is something of a case study in what can go wrong when baseball has a black man.

The name suggestions to the league were in addition to those already being suggested by fans, like "Black Boy," "Brown Boy," "Blue Boy," and "Tiger Boy."

What makes this particularly interesting is that baseball fans use this slur. But that may change in the near future thanks to a very clever tactic the league has apparently been employing for
