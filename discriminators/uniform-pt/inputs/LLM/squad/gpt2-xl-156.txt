 Understanding (1690): "All men are by nature equally free. They may think what they will." And as such, they are morally responsible for the consequences of their actions.

Locke's thought became foundational among rationalists on both sides of the Atlantic after William Paley (1759–1833) applied its principle to the social sciences in his Natural History of Morals (1792), which won a Nobel Prize. This idea, however, proved to be too broad. According to John Stuart Mill (1806–76), its application to ethics led to the fallacy that our moral obligations are "laws of nature," and to a presumption that we might not deserve good treatment by others. The notion of a "natural law" was taken to be arbitrary, and the theory of "natural rights" evolved, with the emphasis on rights to physical liberty, which would be expanded via the American Civil War. (See "The American Revolution" on Wikipedia.)

So while rationalism had its origins in and is primarily concerned with the social context of rights, it evolved into its own distinct ideology over time. Yet, that history would have been inconceivable without the foundational work of moral political philosophers between the 17th and 18th century, and an understanding of them that has gone largely unchallenged, although not without occasional critiques.

Aristotle

Aristotle (384–322) established the first unified way for social scientists to describe "ought," the concept of the moral agent. He divided moral duties into four types: (1) "instrumental," which involves a duty to another at a distance;
