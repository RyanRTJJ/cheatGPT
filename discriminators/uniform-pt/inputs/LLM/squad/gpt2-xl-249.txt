 oldest airport in the Western Hemisphere.

A further airport was built in the U.S. state of Michigan in 1904 in Pontiac (Pontiac Airport). Pontiac Airport is sometimes used as a stand-in when in question is the oldest airport in this country.

The largest airport was established in the U.S. state of Rhode Island in 1962. Today, the runway at Bristol-Mystic International Airport extends over 5,700 km (3,530 mi) between Cape Charles, Massachusetts and Bristol, Rhode Island.

The fastest airports are those that can land airplanes up to 3,600 km (1,870 mi) per hour. However, that's still a speed of under 1 km/h. The fastest of these is the SFO International Airport of Hong Kong in China.

Although not specifically mentioned in the Wikipedia article, one airport can be added to this list that actually landed aircraft faster and was built in a faster time frame, but is now closed due to maintenance issues: the SFO International Airport in Hong Kong. However, it was opened and is still active as a commercial airport.

According to wikipedia, it takes 2-4 747 jumbo jets an hour to reach 10,000 meters (33,000 ft) altitude. However, only 10 planes can be scheduled for the same flight every day. It takes at least 10 minutes to get to the airport; it's not uncommon for a plane to turn around due to mechanical faults.

Some airports are in remote areas, making it difficult to reach the controls in case an emergency arises.
