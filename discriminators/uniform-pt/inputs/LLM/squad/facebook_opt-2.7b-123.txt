 self esteem, etc.) and/or a conceptualization of emotion as a complex blend or “structure” (e.g., anger as structure and anger as substance). Some studies have even proposed the existence of multiple social realities as characterized by the different types of emotions and feelings (Bergsland, 2009; Hirsch, 2010; Kranz, 2013). There is no consensus about how these emotions are organized in individual or groups. However, the role of emotions in individual, group, and societies seem to be largely different. (Webb, 2012). Emotions are widely associated to the functioning of social institutions, to social relations, and to specific actions. Many research have shown that the emotion related to behavior are related to the emotions the individuals experiences before and after the behavior (Forbes, 2014). As we all can observe that the emotional expression vary a lot across cultures (i.e., Chinese, American, Mexican, Indian, etc.) and individuals (Schultz, 2008). In general, people react to their emotions differently by engaging in different activities.

Individual emotions are also linked to cultural values (Lorenz, 2013). People have different emotions and feelings about particular situations. And, these emotions and feelings are related to culture and religion. According to researchers, each person have different ways to manage the emotional expression and different values that define him or her. The cultural values are strongly correlated with individual culture and emotions.
