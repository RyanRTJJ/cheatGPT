 have evolved large lungs and more gas exchange and more efficient cardiovascular systems for ventilating rapidly expanding blood. Birds have a relatively simple respiratory system and a very long respiratory chain. Birds have two lungs: one large pulmonary chamber and one smaller esophageal chamber. The lungs are larger and more powerful than mammals. To keep heat where it belongs in the bird, birds need a high degree of insulation from the inside. They have a highly evolved respiratory mechanism designed to allow them to stay moist and warm. In addition, birds have special adaptations to help regulate their body temperature. Birds have an exceptionally complex and efficient circulatory system known as syrinx. Syrinx regulates the amount of blood oxygen available to the cells and is comprised of a bundle of arteries and veins feeding into the internal jugular veins of the heart. The bird circulatory system can maintain at least three times the volume of blood than most other mammals. It is believed that this increased blood volume results in the development of a more efficient internal engine, which is driven by the flight muscles, giving birds a very high rate of sustained flight and increased endurance capabilities. Birds can stay aloft for days, as long as they have food to feed on

Bird flight does not require wing beats like that of the bats

Most birds are capable of soaring continuously, as long as they have food to feed on. This ability varies according to the species but is based mainly upon a combination of flight muscles and the
