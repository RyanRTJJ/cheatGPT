The Russians were out of the war; Prussia and Austria had no further interest in the dispute between England and France, and Spain had declared war on the French Emperor in the hope of seizing the Iberian Peninsula and perhaps even the Iberian mainland. The only states left were Spain's ally Portugal, the Ottoman Empire, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Prussia's allies, and the Danes. Denmark had been able to hold back the Prussians from the east but was no longer able to do so. Therefore, the new strategic situation was that the remaining major European powers were all on one side and the Ottomans on the other, each of them pursuing its national strategic aims.

In July 1805, Napoleon made a fateful decision in the strategic situation when he took Prussia's ally, Britain, into personal conflict by sending an expeditionary force to assist the sultan of Turkey. The allied fleet and the British naval dockyard at Malta joined forces at the start of August 1805, with the sultan of Turkey leading his fleet, and the allied army, led by the French general Jean Victor d'Albert, advanced into the Dardanelles, where they successfully drove the invaders back to Asia Minor.

Now, at the decisive turning-point in the war, the Ottomans were at the gates of Europe with a fleet of nearly one hundred ships.
