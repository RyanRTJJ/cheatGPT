 for instance, is no less different from North America than it is from Europe, and yet there are striking similarities in both its flora and fauna, in terms of both number and distribution.

**I. THE HISTORY OF THE DISCOVERY OF BIODIVERSITY.**

Although in Chapter VII we saw that both the notion of environmental evolutionism and the notion of a common ancestor were due in part to Darwin's work on phylogeny, these matters still had the character of a mere suggestion, to all intents and purposes a _faux pas_ in the context of the subject. Even though it has been shown that a variety of physical and biological phenomena seem to be due to different causes—such as the distribution of animal and plant species on a planet, their abundance (the biotic community) or even their size—how are we to explain such phenomena as the rise and fall of biotic communities, their alternation and fluctuation? The explanation lay in the fundamental changes that had taken place in the biotic community, and as such it could do no more than refer to the fact that all creatures had been modified by evolutionary processes that affected the traits of individuals and their reproduction. In reality, however, there was now a growing realization that the study of taxa
