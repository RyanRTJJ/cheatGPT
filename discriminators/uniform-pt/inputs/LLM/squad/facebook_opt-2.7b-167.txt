 science. The competition developed between 1957 and the end of the 1970s, and culminated in the Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite. Space races are not uncommon, though they are rare in the sciences. Indeed, the number of successful spaceflight programmes is low and the programmes have a short career. There have been a total of 26 space races. More recently, the USA and Russia have renewed competition, though it focuses on weapons in space using space-based technologies. Read Full Text

The Solar Orbiter mission launched from the Russian Polar Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan on Feb 1, 2013.

The Solar Orbiter carries two scientific instruments: a Sun-directed solar cell array that will study the energy imbalance generated by the sun (or'spinning top effect'), and a multidetector solar wind detection system which will study the physics of the sun's magnetosphere to better understand its role in the solar weather cycle.

As such, the Solar Orbiter mission is the spacecraft's own instrument, and as a result may not be able to operate the way that we did in the past. It was designed to be able to observe the Sun and its processes, something that has yet to be achieved. Perhaps there is something beyond our understanding of science.

We will be taking you into the science experiment that Solar Orbiter's instruments will be performing. We hope that this mission will provide us with important first-hand
