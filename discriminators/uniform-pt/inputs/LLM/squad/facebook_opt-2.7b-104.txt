 their homes, taking refuge in nearby towns. In this conflict, the region’s most prominent clans — known as Barong Cesar and Maguindanao — took their sides. One side battled the other, and a new war broke out after one of the fighting clans, called Tausug, invaded and took over the Marawi city.

The Philippines’ decades-long Muslim separatist movement, as well as China’s growing interest in the island nation — spurred some of the nation’s Muslim communities, which comprised just 6 percent of the roughly 100 million Filipinos, to take up arms in an effort to gain independence for the Muslim majority.

The government and many Filipinos blame the country’s current violence on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which has claimed responsibility for many of the bombings.

“[ISIS] certainly wants to draw attention and create terror and chaos in other places. And that’s not the first time that terror has come [to the Philippines], but the intensity is very frightening,” says Rommel Banlaoi, a lawyer in the country. “We as a nation have experienced this before through the Marcos dictatorship, the [former dictator Ferdinand] Marcos dictatorship — a country that people have so many memories of what terror is like in this country. But nothing like this.”
