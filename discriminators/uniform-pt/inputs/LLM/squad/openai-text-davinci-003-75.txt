ration. It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, uncrewed space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon.

The Space Race began on August 2, 1955, when the USSR, the United States' Cold War rival, sent the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 (Russian for "traveler 1"), into orbit around Earth. That kicked off a space race to achieve ever-greater technological achievements, leading to the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, when the first human being - an American named Neil Armstrong - set foot on the Moon's surface.

Although the Space Race began during the Cold War, its scope extended far beyond the capabilities of two of the world's superpowers. In the course of the space race, at least eleven other countries launched their own space programs. Additionally, a variety of private companies began to establish their presence in space. The accomplishments of the Space Race remain some of the most impressive feats of human engineering and exploration in history.
