 Jerusalem, along with the area of Hebron, is the site where Jews can choose to pray in the holy city. There are places nearby and the prayer area is also called Haram al-Sharif. The prayers there are conducted by some groups in the Hebron area who are known as Haredim or Hasidim.. Jewish prayers are performed there too and sometimes by other Jews from all over Israel.

After the prayer, the congregation then goes to a room called a Haredi synagogue where they are supposed to have quiet for an hour in a room called a Sukkah. The Haredi men go through a series of rituals and it is important to them to see in the Haredi religion what they can take for granted. After the hour of prayer the men of the Haredi community are supposed to eat an important meal called a sekiwan. The meal is a hearty meal, which includes vegetables and fruits. All this is given in honor of God, whom the Haredi believe is also called the 'King of Lords'.

The Haredim are so loyal to the religion because they feel that many, especially in times of extreme tension, could easily go against their beliefs because of their loyalty to the faith and they become extremely angry if they are not properly cared for. The best way to manage that would be to be in close contact with the Haredi people. In time, this will help to prevent the situation spreading too much which would be a disaster to the faith and thus also the community. To this end, we make sure to build a lot of facilities, like special meals with people of different religions and schools for children in the Haredi area. It is important that this should happen regularly. We put a lot of effort into building a special education center for Haredim so that they can learn from other people around them. We also make sure to build special facilities for the children, who are sometimes orphaned from their families.

These initiatives are what keep
