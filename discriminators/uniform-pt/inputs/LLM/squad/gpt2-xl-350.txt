kins' story takes off.

Hoskins, also referred to as Athanasius of Alexandria, (c. 280-247), may seem far-fetched to modern listeners and historians. His legend however has been perpetuated by a plethora of fictionalized biographies, many of which were written to promote religious doctrines. (For example a few chapters were written in honour of the Emperor Constantine IV.) As a result of these works an exaggerated and mythologized view of Hoskins was created throughout classical times to aid the development of a Christian theocracy in western Africa:

Hoskins became the local church priest in the first century after the death of the Apostles in the city and established the first church in Africa…[The] Holy Apostle [was] ordained as priest-he lived in Alexandria during the reign of the Emperor Constantine…. (Wikipedia, "The Father of Africa")

These accounts of Hoskins make the fact that he was a black African seem rather inconsequential, however this may be the case. During his tenure as a priest in Alexandria Hoskins gained the adoration of the city's African population, some of the most notable being Julius Africanus Julius Africanus (c. 150-c. 250 AD), a native Carthaginian who is referred to as one of the most influential leaders in Roman history, a man who achieved great heights during his two-decade rule as Senator and governor-general of Tunisia.

According to Wikipedia, Julius Africanus was "born into a wealthy Roman family" and "became a wealthy Roman senator in the reign of Constantine, the fourth Byzantine emperor and father of the Emperor Constantine IV." Julius Africanus "had an enormous influence on Imperial politics: he was governor-general of Carthage under Augustus, and later the governor-general of Libya under his nephew Justinian, and a bishop in Alexandria under the Empress Julia." (Wikipedia, "The Father of Africa")

While Julius Africanus may not have been a believer, one of the most renowned African church figures of his time was Athanasius. While Julius Africanus's political clout was considerable, Athanasius possessed the spiritual authority of a prophet. It is the nature of prophetic authority is that when held by a prophet the influence they wield is tremendous
