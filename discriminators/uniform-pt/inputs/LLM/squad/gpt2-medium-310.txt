 the east, a broad border area along the Gobi to the south and Baskerville Plateau to the west. The border area is the last line of defence of Switzerland, for it forms the gateway into the rest of Alpine Asia and is consequently the source of water for all of the Swiss republics.

The border area is situated on a ridge known as the Ponte Fermo Mountain-Surmounting Range, and on a series of tributaries to it to the north, east and west. The border area is separated in latitude from its neighbours by approximately 20 kilometres. In the valley outside Switzerland, as in much of the Alps, the terrain of the Alps is arid and inaccessible.

The border area is also covered with hills as the result of local mountain movements. The highest point is situated at 15,624 metres (68,400 feet), of which roughly 8,000 metres (43,000 feet) are below sea level. The lowest are found at 3,840 metres (10,800 feet). Most of the border is of relatively rough and rocky terrain, so that the natural vegetation and other natural resources of the area will remain sparse and underemphasized.

At the north, east and west boundaries of the border area, there are areas of sparse vegetation, grassland and a mountain range on the eastern side of the border.

The border area is of great importance to Switzerland because any attempt to control its borders and to maintain the integrity of its internal borders will inevitably lead to a confrontation between the two countries. Both borders are controlled by means of a network
