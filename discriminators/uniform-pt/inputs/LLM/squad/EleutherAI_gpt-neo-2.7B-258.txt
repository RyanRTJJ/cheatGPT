 and Adventure 03 is a new manga-format anime series, while this series is set in a world where the Adventure and Adventure 02 series are novels.

The Digimon Adventure triad is called the "True Digimon", and are in reality human-monsters that have been possessed by the dark force of the Dark King, who is responsible to create, destroy, and create more of these monsters.

With the exception of the first anime season, it is also not common for anyone named Tamamo-no-Mikoto, who is a direct student of Mitarotamon.

The anime series centers on the battles between the three Digimon members with each Digimon holding a "true ability", which is either a physical or special effect-based ability and/or a special effect-based trait. The series was also intended to feature each member being a unique character, rather than just being types of the same hero.

While the anime series is intended to be the continuation of the Digimon television series, the novels are separate to the anime series in the first place. It has thus been confirmed that the anime will not use the characters and the other Digimon from the novels, as the anime series has its own original characters that the novels won't have anything to do with.

However, Digimon Adventure 01: The Movie, a prequel short directed by Masakazu Nakada, will feature the original protagonists.

After making his debut in the first season, the series continued with the rest of theDigimon adventures into a new season.The anime is made as a series of TV specials for the anime's 30th anniversary. It is still continued in a new series called Digimon Adventure 02.

The anime is directed by Hirozaka Yamaguchi
