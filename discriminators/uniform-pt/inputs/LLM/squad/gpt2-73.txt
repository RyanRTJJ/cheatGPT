 evolutionist evolution could not have occurred without humans as the first species. Yet in the present work, we have found two more interesting aspects of evolution that we can make use of in order to study the more complex features of evolution: the early history of the world into which we come from and the early evolution of the human species. The first step in understanding human evolution can be to recognize that the earliest humans began with a family of mammals like the human lineage and then evolved into very advanced lifeforms.

In their first two chapters, our co-author and graduate student, J.S. O'Brien, uses modern techniques to compare the genome of the European Neanderthal with sequences of the Denisovan human genome, to show that DNA from Neanderthals was not exclusively derived from the early human ancestors, but from ancient relatives of Europeans. The Neanderthals and Denisovans, like the Denisovans, had evolved to form a small, specialized human race with a common ancestor. All these similarities indicate that the earliest humans were descended from a unique ancestral family of African Americans, and that the early Denisovans were genetically predisposed to possess higher human intelligence.

To see what the results will tell us about the origins of the human race, the co-author, G.A. Smith, developed genome sequences of the Denisovan human genome, using DNA extracted from DNA extracted from an archaic hominin in Siberia. He compared them with the Denisovan genomes and found that Neanderthals and Denisovans showed a relatively high level of evolution before human divergence. Even more revealing of
