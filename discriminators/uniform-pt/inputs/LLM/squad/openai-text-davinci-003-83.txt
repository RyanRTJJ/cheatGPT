Some major bands of the era, such as the Rolling Stones, continued to maintain their previous focus on blues/rock style music, while groups like Van Halen and U2 made an effort to incorporate elements of technological advancement and a contemporary sound that represented the changing face of rock and roll. 1980 saw the rise of an early form of alternative rock-pop, known as New Romanticism, which combined pulsing electronic rhythms and the sounds of synthesizers with androgynous, flamboyant looks to gain the attention of the pop music industry. 

The result was a series of groundbreaking hits, many of which fused hard rock, pop and synthesized music into one coherent sound. Whether it be Van Halen’s “Jump”, U2’s “Pride (In the Name of Love)”, or Billy Idol’s “Rebel Yell”, the burgeoning music section of the early eighties established a solid framework for the current era of music. Many of the top songs, such as the iconic hit “Every Breath You Take” by The Police, are still commonly heard today.
