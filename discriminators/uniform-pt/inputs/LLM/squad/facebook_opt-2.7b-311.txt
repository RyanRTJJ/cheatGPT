 has an annual mean temperature (trough to peak, measured over the entire year) of about 11 °C (52 °F). In January 2010, Massachusetts recorded a high temperature of 14.9 °C (58.9 °F), the highest recorded in the state. The monthly variation is very small, with an average of (1) ± 7 °C (15 ± 9 °F), except for extreme cases at the end of January, when the mean temperature can be as high as (4) ± 15 °C (59 ± 15 °F).

Boston receives about 6,900 hours of sunshine annually, and a dry summer makes the city warm enough to support vegetation. The average annual rainfall is about 1,200–1,300 mm (48–52 in), with moderate variability year to year. However, December is a relatively rainy month, with a mean monthly precipitation of (7) ± 1.5 mm (0.06–0.10 in).[2] Summers are mild with (1) ± 2 °F (1 °C) night–day differences on average.

Most precipitation is heavy, falling in less than 1 hr per square km (0.077 hr/mi2) in the city center, while 1 hr per square km (0.077 hr/mi2) falls as light rain west of the city. Precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the city, in line with the climatic conditions of a large continental climate area.

Despite the city's relatively mild temperatures during the winter months, Boston sees high average temperatures (in °C) in August. The highest monthly high (August 2009) was 31 °C (87 °F), the highest in the Northeast since 1949. Only three months of the year (August, November, and February) average (0) °C or (−1) °C temperatures. The city has (10) ± 4.7 F ( −6.2 °C) days each July, August, and September. However, in January it typically experiences (16) ± 3.5 F (−8.3 °C) days each July and August. In January, the temperature rarely exceeds 29 °C (84 °F),
