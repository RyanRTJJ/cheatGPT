 team was forced to play all remaining games in a small, rented stadium. They won nine games in that season and only two more the next one. One of those two was the opening night affair in San Jose that saw them lose all three games. However, they beat Tampa in their last home stand before moving their temporary home to Seattle. One more road trip down north in '99 saw the Caps get another win on the last day of the season before losing in another seven-game winless streak.

They would finish out the year 5-10-4, and make the playoffs for the first time since '96. They would go on to lose each of their first three games of the playoffs on the road and fell on the final day in the East finals to Tampa.
