encian Community, a region made up of the northern coastal areas and inland mountainous areas of the former Kingdom of Valencia. In 2015, Valencian became the second most spoken language in Spain after Spanish, with about 10 million people speaking it. The official language in the Valencian Community is Valencian, although local spoken varieties of Spanish are also used within the area. For this reason, and to avoid confusing people, the Valencian Community uses Spanish as the main medium of communication, but also Valencian as a second language for official purposes. The Valencian Community also has two official and recognised written languages: Valencian and Spanish.

Valencia is the first city in Spain with a direct subway connection to the European Capital of Culture programme[4] (a similar one now opened for the Basque region in Spain).

The city has many museums and places to do tourism. Most famous for its history, art and architecture, but also for music, theatre, cinema, fashion, gastronomy, sports and various other cultural offerings (such as the Bienal de València, a famous concert hall in downtown where bands such as El Bono de Mayo, Joan Manuel Serrat and Cesca live).

The first modern hotel was opened in Valencian in 1767. During the 19th Century, many hotels were built, including the Palacio de Cristobal de Lugo, which is the former residence of the Prince of Asturias.

Today there are more than 500 hotels.

In the Valencian Community, the majority of tourists stay in either the Valencia or the Valencia–Platero d'Osuma area. Some famous tourist destinations in this area include:

Eixample, a shopping district in Barcelona, Spain, including the Prat de Llobregat, El Raval, Santa Cruz de Tenerife and San Cristobal de La Laguna districts.
