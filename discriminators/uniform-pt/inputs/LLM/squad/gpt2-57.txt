 failure of the military effort. It was not for nothing that it became the first state in Iran to become the first to use the oil monopoly.

In 1958, after overthrowing President Mustafa Khomeini in a coup d'etat, Iran signed the OPEC oil price agreements, agreeing to a contract for 60,000 barrels per day in exchange for 10% of Iran's production of refined petroleum. Iran also agreed to pay an additional 10% for every five barrels it produces domestically in exchange for 1,500 barrels of imported gasoline.

However, not all these new projects, along with a series of reforms, led to a rise in production in the 1980s as well. The number of Iranian oil wells is still very low, but there are still several projects operating in fields such as Kewan in the north and Sistan de Lavele in the south. The production boom did not materialize until the early 1990s thanks largely to investment in oil and gas, which is one reason why many of the new projects were initially undertaken as part of efforts at the national level.
