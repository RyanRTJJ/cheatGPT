 helping, being a helper, sharing ideas, and discussing problems. This social environment also helps provide a sense of belongingness and belongingness promotes the acquisition of health-related behaviors.

To a certain extent, peer influences on health behavior and health outcomes have been demonstrated in adolescent populations. For example, among adolescent smokers, high-risk peer groups are consistently the major correlates of smoking outcomes ([@b14-ehp0112-001772], [@b16-ehp0112-001772]).

Healthy people with good social skills, like those who are well-adjusted socially, are likely to have more access to alternative, less hazardous ways of spending time.

Adolescent stress negatively affects peer relationships ([@b3-ehp0112-001772]) and peer approval predicts future health and well-being ([@b22-ehp0112-001772]). In fact, [@b17-ehp0112-001772] demonstrated that if children spent more time with friends, they benefited physically in that it improved their school attendance and grades. Friends tend to share similar interests, which facilitates a better understanding of themselves and other people. According to [@b26-ehp0112-001772], the friends of smokers are more likely to report smoking themselves and may even initiate smoking than friends of nonsmokers.

Smoking is also closely linked to social relationships. In a small study of adolescent smokers, [@b25-ehp0112-001772] detected alterations in neuroendocrine (cortisol) activities, neurophysiology (brain wave pattern), and neuropsychology (attention deficit--hyperactivity disorder) in response to a peer model smoking. The authors postulated that such alterations might "exert profound effects on behavior." These changes appeared to be related to stress caused by the social environment of the adolescents who smoke. [@b27-ehp0112-001772] found that adolescents who
