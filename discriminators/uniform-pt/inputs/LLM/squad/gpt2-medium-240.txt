 as well.

The animals might prefer prey that is familiar to them or are a food substitute for the animals' energy.

Some species of blue jays use camouflage and disguise themselves and their babies within foliage that attracts other blue jays to their nest, for instance. This camouflage is called "barking," while their nest may be under a tree or in the brush.

Blue jays are secretive predators, hiding in the brush or trees to hide for days or even weeks until it's time for the males to mate.

They will use scent energy to attract males, and the most experienced and intelligent birds learn to recognize their favorite females by scent.

A male blue jay may come from many places, possibly from several different habitats.

Blue jays do not make their nest in their nests, but rather their nests.

The males lay about 100 to 1,500 eggs, and each egg is a few centimeters long--long enough for a mother to crawl up out of the nest. Usually, a newborn female blue jay has been laid at about 13,000 to 16,000 eggs.

During her first two months of life, a male blue jay has to swim away from home until she's nearly ready to move in with him again. The process is slow, taking about 1/2 a day. By the end of the second month, females and their cubs can be expected to travel at least 40 kilometers (25 miles) on a side trip each day.

One of the most beautiful moments in blue jay life is when the male pups
