-soon carried the torch in the rain and heavy mist.

The South Korean President Park Geun-hye addressed the crowds with a message to encourage the people in the streets which she said was about love for the country.

The torchbearers held up the flame on the stage and after the President, it was passed down to the next torchbearer.

In a press release last Sunday, the organizers of the annual national holiday of Songkran observed that although the weather was pleasant, many people complained of heavy rains, which were forecast to continue.

Songkran started yesterday morning as usual. But as the rain continued and the temperature dropped, the event got pushed back to 6pm on Friday, which was also declared a national holiday.

By the time the day began, rain was falling on the stage and in the audience, making for the first time a poor turnout.

By 11am, the mood had changed to one of optimism with an enthusiastic crowd.

The torchbearers were in the main square before the presidential palace. They lit up the flame, but the wind kept blowing the fire and the flames kept going out.

The flames of the torch remained visible on the red carpet.

The stage had to be moved to the park for the rest of the event. The rain continued to fall heavily on the audience.

The first to hold up the torch was Park Won-soo, but the flame continued to flicker due to the weather conditions.

In the third quarter, Park Won-soo continued to support the flame, but he had to be helped to hold up the torch.

Another problem that happened is that the wind blew the flame away from Park Hye-sun, who joined Park Won-soo, but the winds also changed, bringing down the flame when Park Hye-sun was holding it by his feet. He eventually lost his balance and went down on his face.

It was then that Yoon Kye-yong stepped on the stage.
