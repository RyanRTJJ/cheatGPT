 where the original Digis transform into something like dinosaurs by means of powerful machines known as digivice.

In order to bring the fourth series to the largest possible audience, a wide variety of anime-related products were created for it, ranging from collectible toys to television shows to video games and even the creation of a whole new franchise to go along with it.

Here I will take a look at the products that were made for the fourth Digimon series:

The most memorable aspects of the Digivice — the most iconic in fact — are its red and blue colors, and of course its ability to transform the Digis into any of the eight dinosaur species. However, the digivice itself is just a small part of the overall Digimon experience, as it often serves as a tool for transferring data between the Digipets, most notably during the battles. This system is referred to as “recycle” in some forms of the series, since the digivice is sometimes used to repair the Digimon, or even to repair their digis.

For example, in many later versions of the series, the same digivice is refitted with a smaller screen to fit in a child’s hand, such that it can be used as a smartphone. In general, these handheld digivices become more sophisticated over time, with the fourth and fifth versions of the Digimon being two of the most popular devices. In addition, it is now possible to connect the digivice to a computer as well, thus allowing users to play games
