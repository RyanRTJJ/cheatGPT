 political and religious strata remained largely Greek citizens, though they came to form a large and increasing minority within the Seleucid Empire. The Greek population became the primary and almost exclusively Jewish group in these cities, including the Temple, and their religious ritual was almost entirely Greek.

Greek Jews and Christianity

The relationship between both religions changed during the 1st centuries A.D. at the most, though not fundamentally, when Christ became the king of the Greeks. Greek Christianity was founded by the Greek philosophers Socrates, Demeter and Dionysus. This movement towards Christianity by its founders, along with other developments in Greek social organization, prompted much scholarly discussion about the social origins of the Jewish people. In Greek philosophy, the Jew was seen as a rational person, a being able to reason about things that make sense to us, a Jew in the sense of being morally opposed to everything that does not make sense to us; in the Greco-Bactrian world, the Jewish person was considered one of a kind. (In Homer's time, they were also viewed as being "gods of the earth" or "wise men" who had created the world.) Although Greek philosophy differed strongly from the Christian religion, it retained much of the Jewish moral philosophy that Christians had developed. The Greek philosopher Demetrius Aquinas argued that, for all the many differences between Greek and Christian thought, Jewish morality remained essentially the same, with the only difference being the "philosophical position" from which the Greek world emerged. (This position could be called the political Aristotelianism of the middle-200s, or the Aristotelian view of human nature as "the pure, immutable essence of humanity.") Jewish Christianity was distinct from Greek philosophy. There was, however, something else that distinguished it, something that made it distinct from all other Jewish religions in the world: Jews were Jews. So was their world; so were their moral views; so what did they really believe?
