This particular language is not even a part of our present understanding of Chinese. I don't believe this is a problem for the language, except within a set of criteria.

Some would say more specifically "this language is not like any other. This language is all about the present, not the past." "If you use it, it is different."

Why don't you use it when it comes to any other English language? No language can make itself feel new. For example, there are words such as "brave," which does not have something akin to a sound like "brave" or "beauty" in common English; there are also "likes," which do not. If they are in common English, the English language will seem familiar. So "this" will be an obvious result (at least to me).
