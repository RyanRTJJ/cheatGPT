Z Top's self-titled album was placed in the top five, and as the decade ended Alice Cooper's highest charting album Alice, which was released in 1973, achieved a peak of number two that year.

Following the release of Alice, Cooper recorded two more albums that were modest commercial hits, 1977's Welcome to My Nightmare became a Top-10 record, while the following year's Alice II was more narrowly rejected by critics and reached a peak of number 25 on the albums chart. By the mid-1980s other rockers had also begun to gain popularity outside the United States, with bands such as Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Motley Crue, Ozzy Osbourne all doing well internationally, and Alice Cooper was forced to change the look of his band. His next album, Nightmare II, which was released in 1986 and featured contributions from drummer Ginger Baker, bassist Michael Anthony and guitarist Eric Carr as well as additional keyboards, was seen as a return to Alice’s horror themes.

In the years since Alice Cooper’s return to his horror roots on Alice, Cooper has gone on to release a series of well-received solo albums that have found increased popularity in recent years. His new album Alice, which features lead vocalists Tony Iommi, Randy Rhodes and Ginger Baker once more, has been re-released on January 20th in two separate editions; a bonus disc which comprises live performances and rarities from the past and a deluxe version which has an additional disc and two DVD’s, one of which being The Concert film presented in Blu-Ray.

As a special treat on the album releases, Metal Minds has had the opportunity to interview Alice Cooper.

Metal Minds: Alice Cooper, let's start with some very simple questions: how are you? How are the band at present?

Alice Cooper: Good as gold, son! How about yourself?

The last record, Alice, is the first one that I've worked on for many years. As always, that's what you do. When did you record this and how much did it cost to get it released?
