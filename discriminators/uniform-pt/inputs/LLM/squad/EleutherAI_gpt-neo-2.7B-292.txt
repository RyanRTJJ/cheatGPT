 Marathas extended their power to Nagpur in Central India. Under the rule of Maharaja Bajirao III, there was further expansion of rule in areas including Peshawar, Lahore, Amritsar, Agra, and Mathura.

Under the rule of the Marathas (1740â€“1773)
 

The 18th century witnessed a period of increased Maratha rule in the Indian Subcontinent, during which the Marathas extended their influence in central and southern India from Nagpur to Nagpur. The empire expanded from Madras to Bengal, Bombay, and Sindh, from Gujarat to Delhi and Rajasthan. According to the English historian and orientalist Edward Lane Fox, "The history of the Maratha territory was, in the main, a history of an invasion and of conquests.... it was chiefly that kind of a country which appealed to the imagination of early travellers and visitors". They extended their influence from Bombay, the ancient capital of the Chahamana dynasty, which had reigned from 1526 A.D. to 1801, when it was conquered by the Marathas in a major military confrontation at Dholpur, Rajasthan. Bombay attained its greatest significance during this era, in light of the large number of Maratha traders, merchants and soldiers, who crossed into the Persianate trading ports of Gujarat, Sindh and Rajasthan. The Maratha period saw the rise of an indigenous state. This was the Mahratta Confederacy of Rajput and Yadav dynasties. They established their capital at Nagpur. The Maratha emperor's family was called by the British as the Baji Rao I. Their main cities were at Nasik, Nagpur, Surat
