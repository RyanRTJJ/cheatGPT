 and the cinematography is pretty decent. There are the occasional moments that make you want to hurl to the ground and shout, 'God, fuck this movie again,' as the story slows to a crawl, but it's always handled so beautifully, so fluidly and expertly that you just want to keep going. The cast is absolutely lovely, and while you could feel the pressure from the first couple minutes, you really need to watch the movie once. You really feel like the protagonist." The movie's music by Efian Tohni also received praise, and in an interview with the French website Cinefex, Tohni commented. "When a movie is created for the cinema, it must be performed by those who know it; what can be said when only a selection comes out? 'The Movie, Auteur and Sound Design' [by Jonathan Cazeneuve, Jean-Denis Villeneuve and David Ayer] is a beautiful film, with extraordinary visual and an extraordinary performance from the young female actress, Evita. It's not a movie that will play in a theater, even if you watch it multiple times. It deserves the attention of all film lovers. We must not be able to see a movie in which the actors and directors are not able to enjoy it. It needs to be seen. As long as you give your respect, we will enjoy it."
