udians. Even the youngest children can be traced back by ancestors from India in time, and those that have been raised by British parents have not been able to differentiate between black and black Caribbean ancestors in some detail between their ancestors. Nevertheless, the evidence from two different Caribbean islands provides interesting evidence of this difference. One is of old Indian, the other of ancient Indian, and the Indian ancestry of the Caribbean Indians shows that they are largely genetically different, including black and European descent as well as their Indian-speaking cousins, as suggested by the strong Indian influence over the Caribbean Indians.[9] The second is the fact that the Irish, the indigenous inhabitants of Bermuda, were of very similar genetic type with the exception of a few small islands that were previously thought to be inhabited by more recently indigenous people. The oldest Irish population is thought to lie in the vicinity of Bermuda, though it is unclear, to what extent this may be the case relative to other British colonies. If it was, then it would tell us that some of the older Irish were also Native American and thus had less cultural baggage than the older Irish. At the same time, the genetic makeup of this Irish population is likely to be similar to that of the Irish group of people who came to the United States in the late nineteenth century to establish some contact with our nation's native people. It is this difference that allows Bermuda to be considered as the home of the Irish in the eighteenth century.

There are other ways in which the Bering Irish are a common element in the culture of our people, particularly in Bermuda. Here we find evidence for what we call 'native origins'; those people of the Irish
