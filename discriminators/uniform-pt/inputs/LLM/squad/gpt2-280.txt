 were also some differences along the phonograph's line, including the use of a stylus, in the production of the instrument. The phonograph, in turn, recorded certain things, the way any piece of jewelry would record something. Edison's company, Bally Midway, made the phonograph as part of a business, and used it to record and make recordings of numerous works, including a poem. (This was the first time a recording device was used on a live radio broadcast.) The phonograph was the first modern, compact model to feature a microphone that was attached to an endcap. Like the phonograph, it sold for $3,500 in 1884 with sales of $8,000 to $10,000 per unit on the first day of sales.[11] The endcap is not found today. The final phase of Edison's history, about 2,500 years ago, was built on a sheetrock. It would be used throughout Edison's time and career. (While the second phase was probably unfinished, this version would run on the Edison Electric Power Company's T-mobile for several years until it was discontinued in 1967. The T-mobile was built to carry some 10,000 volts of power, which was a small, lightweight device for long runs at low load.) Edison produced some more phonographs later on in the history of radio history, but none of them were as big or powerful as the one found today. Their power was limited to 60 watts, and in 1868, the National Electric Company cut down on the size of their phonograph. In
