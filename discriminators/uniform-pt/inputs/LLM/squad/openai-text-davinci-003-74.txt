 Nature through empirical observation and the evidence of experimentation. Europeans used the idea of "race" as a way of explaining the difference between Europeans and non-Europeans, particularly groups from the Americas and Africa. This difference was initially explained in terms of visible physical features such as skin color and other features. Over time, attempts were made to explain these differences in terms of more abstract concepts such as intelligence, language and culture. 

However, there has been debate over the concept of race for centuries. Critics of the concept argue that the scientific basis of ‘race’ is weak and that the idea is based on social and cultural differences. They argue that ‘race’ is ultimately a socially constructed concept that is used to perpetuate stereotypes and systems of inequality. Furthermore, they point out that since race is based on superficial physical differences, it ignores important distinctions that are based on cultural, social and economic factors. In response to these criticisms, much of the European scientific community has shifted away from the concept of ‘race’, embracing instead the idea of human biodiversity. This approach attempts to discuss patterns of genetic variation among populations, while avoiding the problematic term ‘race’.
