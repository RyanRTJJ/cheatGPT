 their diverse nutritional needs.

The smallest, least-observable mammals are the very latest to evolve, emerging in the last 20 million years. Today's very smallest are the dwarf lemurs (Microcebus spp), endemic to Madagascar. In this image of Microcebus spp. and Malagasy giant rats (Petrodomus madagascariensis), the tiny lemur is shown against the huge rat.

The lemur's diminutive size places some fundamental constraints on their physical development. Most lemurs are nocturnal and solitary, sleeping all day in rocky crevices or the burrows of arboreal primates. Dwarf lemurs feed by extracting food from foliage they glean with their dexterous long forelimbs. They then store excess energy as fat, using large fat stores and a specialised diet including tree gum (Myrobalan spp.) and leaf pulp.

Tiny bodies and energy efficiency

Although smaller relative to body size, the fossil record shows that the earliest lemur ancestors were larger and more energetically efficient.

By contrast, the size of many current lemur species today and their ability to make a living has resulted, at least in part, from adaptations.

The largest primates

A fossil of the ancestor of the largest primate, the Indri indri (Pithecia indri) from Madagascar.

Pithecia was an early genus of lemur like the early primates, such as the lemur's ancestor, the Daubentonia. The Daubentonia was an early mammal, related to the mammals that have the most descendants among living species. The Daubentonia had a body about three times that of the earliest lemurs. But by one million years ago the Daubentonia disappeared and was replaced by a new genus, Pithecia, which was about half the
