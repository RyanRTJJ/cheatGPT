 the northwest and the North Sea-style Jura to the southeast; the central Plain of Jura has no coastal margin. The Alpine divide is a series of parallel, high ridges that separates the highlands to the north and south, each with distinct climatic conditions and vegetation of alpine and subalpine ecosystems.

The Alps proper are a western offshoot of the European mountain system. They occupy a broad area between the Italian Alps, the Alps proper and the Rhaetian Alps. They stretch along the Italian border where it forms a low plain, the Swiss pre-Alps region or pre-Alps, as the Swiss portion is traditionally called.
The highest hill is the Jura mountain range in the southeast. It runs for about 110 km from Lake Neuchâtel in the north to the Swiss border in the south and is separated from the high tableland of the Vosges (to the north) and the Central Plateau (to the south) by the middle chain of the Alps. The Jura is made up of the Jura Fournaise, a great tableland which is connected to the Alps by a line of low mountain ranges that are known locally as the Rheinwald, Rübistal, Rauental, Jura-Neuwald and the Jura-Blaue Rupie.
The Alps proper stretch from the Rheinwald to the Furka Pass. They lie astride the border between southern Germany and western Switzerland, and were traditionally regarded as the most famous mountain range in Europe. Most Alpine resorts lie in the south of the region; the ski slopes of the northern part of the range, especially in France and Austria, often surpass those
