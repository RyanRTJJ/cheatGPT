lier catalogue. Early proponents of metal, such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, had their commercial success and iconic status cemented during the period with a string of gold and platinum selling albums.

The hard rock genre was the commercial champion of the era, particularly for established rock acts. The emergence of glam metal bands, such as Bon Jovi, Poison, and Mötley Crüe, helped to diversify the genre and attract a wider audience. Motley Crue's "Dr. Feelgood" (1989) was the first heavy metal album to hit No. 1 on the Billboard albums chart, a feat mirrored by Ozzy Osbourne's No More Tears (1991). AC/DC's Back in Black (1980) sold an estimated 50 million copies worldwide and was the fourth best-selling album of all time as of May 2014.


Other bands that benefited from the commercial appeal of hard rock during the period included Boston, Def Leppard, Aerosmith, Van Halen, and Guns N’ Roses. Guns N’ Roses' Appetite for Destruction (1987) sold 30 million copies worldwide, ranking as one of the best-selling albums of all time. Metallica's so-called 'black album' (1991) was another huge commercial success, selling 16 million copies worldwide and remaining at the top of the Billboard albums chart for four weeks.
