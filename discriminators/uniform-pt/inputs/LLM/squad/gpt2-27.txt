 returned to the mainland where they formed the Xingtian Nation.

In the late 16th century Wu Sangui's body was buried with Shang Kexi in the tomb, where they built new monuments to their son and Wu. The new Qin dynasty was organized in 1739 by Wu Leng, which in turn became a central figure in the world of Chinese political discourse.

Ritual

Qi Jiao Xi (1885â€“1989) was an expert historian in Chinese history. He first wrote about the rise of dynasties in early eighteenth century China as a possible historical chronicle. By studying Qing dynasty records with reference to Shang Kexi, he concluded that the Qing dynasty was an ancient and very rich and powerful dynasty, which would continue through the period known as the first millennium.

He also studied medieval Chinese history of the Qing system and contributed to a theory that the Shang dynasty originated outside China.

In 1902 a paper titled The Great Transformation in Chinese History (L. J. Cheng) was published.

This research led to the early work by Wang Xingli, who became China's first person to write about the "Great Three Dynasties."

Wang Jie-li, who wrote much of the most successful books in history of Qing dynasties, also used this data to help his Chinese readers write the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) History of the People's Republic of China on the Qing Dynasty and its associated era. This was due to him and his colleagues' ability to combine the great history of the country's earliest dynasties and China's history of political growth, as well as a number of studies within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the history of politics in China.

By this time, scholars were beginning to understand the early Qing period in China and the relationship between the two groups of Chinese people.

Early Dictatorship

The Qing dynasty of the late middle part of the first millennium (about 1600 AD) began as a dynastic system. In the name of the emperor Jing Zhen, a group of people would rule over the capital, Mingxi, and eventually the Great River.

The capital, Mingxi, was a big
