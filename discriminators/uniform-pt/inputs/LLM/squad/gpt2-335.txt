, the number of Jewish populations in the world was approximately 50%, with Israel the top and the Palestinians the second and third. In 2008, the IHSC identified 11 other groups underrepresented by Druze, 5 for Druze and 1 for Arab, with 7 for Palestinian Arab and 2 for Arab, respectively. As of late 2010, there is limited information regarding the demographics and physical characteristics of Druze living within Palestine.

The researchers concluded that:

Druze and Palestinian children as a group are more likely to have Jewish parentage at lower levels than do non-Jewish children, having a lower per-ethnic ratio (Pr). These data were based on the National Jewish Census by the Pew Research Center in 2000 and the United States Census by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1982.

These data are based on the National Jewish Census by the Pew Research Center in 2000 and the United States Census by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1982. There are limited data available on the composition, ethnic, religious and socioeconomic status of Druze Jews. While the research has shown that Druze population is not evenly divided among the Muslim and Jewish societies, there is no data that suggest Druze in many populations is more or less cohesive.
