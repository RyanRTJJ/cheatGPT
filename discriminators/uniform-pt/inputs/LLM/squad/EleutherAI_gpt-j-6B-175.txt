 of the disease or the origin, transmission or evolution of the agent. Typically, clinical laboratories and microbiologists employ a range of identification tests, including serological tests; metabolic tests, such as carbon assimilation, fermentation and/or gas production; and physiological tests, such as motility. These types of tests are employed to determine the infectious nature of an agent, which helps the clinician to formulate a diagnosis and initiate the corresponding treatments [B. Rima, F. V. Rima, G. L. Ganser, ed. Laboratory Methods and Guidelines for Infectious Disease Diagnosis and Treatment. 2nd ed. New York, NY: Garland Science, 1999.], e.g. to make differentiation between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, determine the presence of exotoxins and/or toxins such as adhesins, determine the presence of enterotoxins, hemolysins, leukocidins and exfoliative toxins and differentiate between spore-producing and spore-nontransducing bacteria. Recently, methods based on whole genome sequence analysis (e.g., genomic sequencing) have been employed for bacterial identification, although the complexity of the protocols and equipment required make such methods inaccessible to most clinical labs and clinicians [L. M. Whitehouse et al., Diagnostic Microbiology and Infection 18 (2): 139-142 (2005). Despite the many options, there remains a need for the identification of a range of pathogenic bacteria with the same assay system.
For detection of bacteria that are motile by means of flagella, motility has been demonstrated as a specific and highly sensitive technique to identify bacteria, and has generally been accepted as the “gold standard” [A. Schuerholz, W. Steuer, W. F. Fuchs, Ann. Rev.
