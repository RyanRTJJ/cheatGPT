 the East. Coffee houses sprang up all over the city in the 18th century as the bourgeoisie took to drink with enthusiasm.

Today's Paris offers a wide range of choices. There are many restaurants, small and large, catering to a variety of needs, but most famous for its brasseries which serve food from various regions, and which constitute a major part of the restaurant scene.

The French have long had a reputation for good food, and since the 20th century Paris has gone from strength to strength on numerous gastronomic fronts. Today the city is synonymous with haute gastronomie, offering more opportunities for gourmands than any city in the world.

Brasseries: A common feature of cities like Paris is that in the late afternoon, the cafes begin to fill up with people who have finished work. They need somewhere for a bite to eat. Some are famous for their drinks (the famous Cafe de Flore), others are famous for the food that they serve all day (La Coupole, Le Bar Americain). Often they have a wine menu which is extensive, especially for wine that is drunk in France.

These restaurants have a brasseries specialisation - sometimes called a Brasserie de Nimes or a Brasserie de Tours. For example, Le Grand Café de Paris is known for roast meats, Le Petit Rémy as an omelette specialist and Le Grand Véfour as a "Vésuvey"
