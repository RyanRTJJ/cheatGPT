The four periods of 45 minutes between each of the first three matches are called "final periods". When the play begins, each team advances to the quarter-finals, when the teams advance to the final meeting, and then the half-hour begins for each team's next game. Each half lasts 30 seconds and the final match is played at 6:30 a.m. ET on Sunday, Aug. 5 at home against the Portland Timbers, which starts at 1 p.m. PT and concludes at 7 p.m. ET. The fourth period begins at 2 p.m. ET and ends at 5 p.m. ET, and will return to Seattle at the end of the regular season.

The league is pleased to announce that on Sunday, July 29, the 2014 MLS Players' Union will host a second season of regular-season soccer on Comcast SportsNet Seattle, at the T-Mobile Arena at Mile High.
