The doctrine of last days is also found in the Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and Sikh religions. Some Jews and Christians believe that world events have their origin in a "Jewish World War" that began in 1914 (the 1914 war which ended the First World War but allowed the formation of the United States of America and the formation of the League of Nations â€“ for which Britain was partly responsible) and ends in the "end of time" or "last days". Jehovah's Witnesses believe that all Bible events leading up to this moment are actually part of a "prophecy" or "prophets series" about when the current world will end.
