 in exchange for assistance in their own personal life. A few Manchu groups could be recognized as Chavic or Mongol, depending on their own cultural background. Although some Mongols were not officially recognized by the Government of Japan, all other families that might be considered Manchu were, nevertheless, registered using the name of their adopted son or daughter - the name they chose - as the father and mother.

In these cases, the Manchu name used before birth usually was either written or recorded as the son of the first male family or as the younger, if not the older, male brother, or as the sister or daughter. However, Manchu could also be written at birth or sometimes before as many as fifteen years with the names still present in these families. This does not mean that the Manchu names were still written under the leadership of their new sons or daughters; they simply meant that when a son or daughter became a "Manchu," it had an ancestor named after him.
