 for 50 years or more, and point, in particular, to the widespread student opposition to the Vietnam War, which has played a substantial role in the formation of Yale liberals. Others, however, feel that there is in part a deeper cause for the representation of Yale conservatives. Several scholars have argued that the conservative student movement at Yale has been nurtured and fostered by the university as a whole, and that in particular by its faculty and administrators.[xii] Although these authors point to a number of reasons why conservative students should have played a central role in the antiwar movement, they are united in arguing that political involvement on campus has resulted simply, and overwhelmingly, in the marginalization of liberal values.[xiii]

I disagree. Yale students are engaged in a wide variety of political activities, largely on their own initiative. Moreover, by taking a stand and speaking out against the war, they have brought into the open matters that they have privately considered. Moreover, because the war is a central issue in American politics, they have played a strong role in defining the terms of the debate, even when they have been the subjects of attacks. The liberal values I have in mind are liberal values of the kind exemplified in such statements as "liberty, freedom, fairness, justice, equality, tolerance, respect, and civility"
