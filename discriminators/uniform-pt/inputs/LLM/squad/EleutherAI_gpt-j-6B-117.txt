 At its peak in the spring and summer of 1941, German bombs fell nightly into Glasgow, Paisley, Renfrew and Clydebank, and in addition there were raids upon Dundee, Stranraer and Greenock. In the end Glasgow was worst hit, the city sustained 50% of all British civilian deaths in World War II.

Some 40,000 residents of Clydeside abandoned their homes. In those neighbourhoods which had been bombed and had been declared ‘no-go areas’ families took refuge in church basements and other locations. In January 1940 Glasgow Corporation set up a refuge centre in a disused hotel in the centre of Clydebank. There were over 500 children accommodated there from a wide area of the city. The Clydebank refuge site was later upgraded and became the second largest in the UK, with nearly two thousand people in a network of temporary huts.

The bombing of Clydeside was to continue regularly throughout the war. In September 1941 it extended to the towns and villages of Cambuslang, Partick, Pollokshields, Springboig, Saltcoats, Clydebank, Rutherglen, Dalmuir, East Kilbride, Hamilton, Croy, Partick and Ralston. At the end of the war, in November 1945, a total of over 12,000 civilians were evacuated and settled in three new towns: East Kilbride (formerly Clydebank No1) and Springboig (formerly Pollokshields) to the north, and Cambuslang (formerly Clydesdale No 2) to the south-east.

The Clydebank Blitz came at the end of a long period of conflict. The threat of a German invasion had been looming since September 1939, but it was only with the German invasion of Belgium and France
