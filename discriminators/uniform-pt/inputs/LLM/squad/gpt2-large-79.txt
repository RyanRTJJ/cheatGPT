 only current remaining player from the '99 team was Caray. He made the most of a chance to take advantage of his playing time in the postseason by aced his first postseason start, allowing the team to win the first of three straight from the Washington Redskins with a 26-2 drubbing to the New Orleans Saints. Caray would finish the '98 season with a career-low 20.1 Total QBR, the lowest mark of any quarterback he faced all season. However, the team would have success in '99 with rookie Steve McNair and veteran Kurt Warner making starts in the playoffs. All said, Caray was a critical factor to the success of the '98 team. Caray finished the season with a career-high 6.1 Total QBR and finished as the league's fifth-highest passer with a 78.2 completion percentage. While that season has yet to be recognized, it was one of the best individual performances of the decade by a rookie quarterback.

The '01 season was notable for one thing: the departure of several longtime starters for injury rehab stints. One of the biggest departures came in the form of Terrell Davis. The San Diego Chargers' star running back suffered a torn ACL in his right knee in the final preseason game and missed the rest of the season. It cost him the playoffs and the franchise its opening playoff victory of '01. A short, quick-footed runner of uncertain ability who hadn't played football in five years and never appeared in the postseason, the impact this injury had on the Chargers franchise wasn't entirely clear at the time.

Still, given the lack of significant success and the general ineptitude around the NFL, what was the point of having Davis as the team's featured back? The fact was that Davis had played for the Colts, Raiders, and 49ers before the season and his playing days seemed to be over. He failed an initial physical on January 6, 2000 but was able to return in time for the playoffs after his knee injury healed. He would run for only a single touchdown, however, and he was out during the first round of the playoffs.

Darrell Green did a remarkable job in 2003 after losing his former quarterback. The veteran third-round
