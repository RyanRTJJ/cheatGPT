 smaller continents of Laurasia and Gondwana. The first dinosaur-like (non-avian) birds appeared on Laurasia during the early-to-middle Triassic, and the first true birds appeared in the middle to late Triassic. The earliest bird remains found to date are from the late-Jurassic Early Cretaceous Barremian stage, in Argentina, but the earliest definite bird remains have been found in the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation and elsewhere in North America. Dinosaur fossils have been discovered throughout the rest of Laurasia, Europe and Gondwana, but most of them are fragmentary.

The oldest remains of birds are from the Jurrassic-Triassic boundary, with some reports indicating they are from as early as 203.9Ma.[1] Fossils of Mesozoic birds (including some of the earliest birds) are known for Europe, South America, Madagascar, and several Pacific archipelagos, both on land and as flying reptiles in the air.[2]

The history of modern birds probably began around the close of the Early Cretaceous or perhaps the beginning of the Late Cretaceous period. However, early evolutionary relationships among modern birds are unclear. There is no compelling evidence that Aves is anything more than a basal eukaryotic lineage that is descended from the last common ancestor of Eukarya.

One of the oldest records of dinosaurs is a nearly complete fossil of an Archaeopteryx from the Middle Jurassic of Germany. It is believed to be the first feathered dinosaur that is closely related to birds. Another, and
