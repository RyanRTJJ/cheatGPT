On Thursday, the torch traveled to Paris to arrive at the Eiffel Tower for the torch relay's arrival ceremony.

A few hours later, the torch arrived at the Olympic Park.

There, it was honored by Parisians as the Olympic torch for two days before moving into Saint-Germain-des-Prés for the official torchlight display on Saturday afternoon.

"We must make this decision so that all of those who choose to participate in this great mission can be inspired and inspired to give their lives as brave martyrs for our country and for the greater good, be inspired to give their life to help others," IOC President Thomas Bach said at the ceremony.
