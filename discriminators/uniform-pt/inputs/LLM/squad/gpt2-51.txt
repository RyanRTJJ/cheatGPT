 to feel if their conditions were improved.

But while the findings of such work have prompted a renewed interest in e-cigs, the scientists say their work has also shed light on the need for new treatments. While the technique can help overcome severe asthma and other allergies, it would still require further research to show it can work safely at the scales of the health system.

"We are making quite a significant breakthrough," said Schachter in a video address to the Royal Society.

"E-Cigs have a long history with us. We know there are multiple ways to use them, but we think this would make e-cigs even better," he said.

Abstract

The recent success of e-Cig e-fiber fiber is linked to the fact that chronic allergic responses to it occur naturally and through the systemic nervous system. We show that the potential of e-Cig e-fiber fiber may be extended to other tissues via alterations in intestinal contents at the microscopic level. The aim of this study is to provide clinical validation to the experimental proof that e-cigs are safe over a wide
