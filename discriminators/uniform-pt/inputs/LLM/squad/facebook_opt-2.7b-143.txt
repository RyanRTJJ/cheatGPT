 some instances these records would be made with a sheet metal or paper backing, and would be covered with a flexible plastic, typically polyester, to reinforce the sound. Such materials were often referred to as "plasticized" records. Because of their plastic qualities, plasticized records have been prone to distortion even in a low frequency range. This distortion can be reduced by the use of a very low-resistance "plasticizer" coating on various parts of the record.
One particular type of record which has found broad success in the marketplace is the flexible record sleeve, which is often made of paper. It is highly flexible, but rigid enough to retain its shape and form in response to the applied pressure or force at the surface of the record. Such materials have been used extensively for many years by manufacturers of phonograph records and their accompanying apparatus and accessories, and have found particularly widespread use in connection with phonograph records and associated reproducing devices wherein the phonograph records are housed in record sleeves.
It is apparent from the foregoing that flexible records and associated materials thereof are very desirable to a person desiring to produce music of any type, and particularly in the area of phonograph records and their associated reproducing devices wherein rigid plastic record sleeves are used.
