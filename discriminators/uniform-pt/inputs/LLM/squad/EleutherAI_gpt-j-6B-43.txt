 of Galicia in modern France in Roman times. Over a thousand years ago, this coastal region was the most important trade-hub in the entire Iberian Peninsula, thanks in part to the presence of an important Roman settlement, Tingitani, on the Guisar (Guriza) river.

Galicia had a large population in the Middle Ages, owing to its proximity to the trade of northern Europe. To this day, Galicia has strong commercial relations with the UK, Germany, and Austria.

Climate and environment

Galicia has a temperate climate and is largely protected by mountains and the Ebro River valleys. The mildest climate in the peninsula is in Galicia, while in the north it is more humid, with mountains, forests and plateaux in the most northern region.

The province is in the coastal area of the autonomous region, with the cities of Vigo and Santander being important ports. The Ebro Valley, with the cities of Santiago de Compostela, Pontevedra, Vigo and A Coruña at its heart in the North, are the most populated and economically important parts of the province.

Despite the mild climate, Galicia has many torrential rivers, which have carved the landscape into spectacular gorge landscapes, like the Rúa Serpa or the Río Miño.
The landscape, with its limestone in the north and marble in the south, is varied and contains a number of cultural gems, like the Romanesque Churches of Lugo, the monastic complex of Cistercian Monastery of Lobeira, and the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, Spain's holiest city.

The coastal waters of Galicia form part of the largest area of semi-natural Atlantic Ocean habitat in Europe under protection of the European eBird project, and other large protected areas include the Lagunas de Onís (Onis wetlands, where the Galician national park is located), the Vigo Lagoon and some smaller areas like the Rías Altas.
