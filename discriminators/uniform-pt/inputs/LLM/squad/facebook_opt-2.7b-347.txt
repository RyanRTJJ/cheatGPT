 that drinking water is the sole source of our hydration needs is now widely recognized.

It has been recently stated by many authorities that the quantity of water consumed daily is not the only source of our water requirements. Drinking water is not the only source of minerals that hydrate the body and can contribute to the proper functioning of the body. Even water obtained from non-potable sources may be a contributing factor for the hydration needs.

According to Dr. Joseph Ciappetta, Director of the National Institute for Aging and Geriatric Medicine in Rochester, NY: “The notion that water should be our only source for hydration is old-fashioned, and there are far better ways to provide our hydration needs other than relying solely on water alone or without any of the other necessary minerals…We have only just begun the process of assessing and understanding the many water-independent sources of essential minerals in our diets, and how a multiform and diverse approach of consuming those foods, including water, provides a wide array of essential, and sometimes required, minerals and nutrients that can increase the likelihood of healthy aging.”…http://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-03-drinking-water-must-more.html

The best source of water should of course be filtered clean and fresh from a municipal water source, but other foods and beverages too often overlooked as sources of minerals and vital nutrients can also contain important electrolytes necessary for the body.

When looking at sources of these non-potable nutrients, it is important to examine the full list of what these foods contain as electrolytes. They can also be obtained through the diet, which is sometimes a difficult concept for many who think it is more about “eating less” to lose weight than about “eating healthfully” to prevent the risk factors
