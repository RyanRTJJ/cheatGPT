oths have a sensitive retinal system that recognizes the difference in polarized light (Vitzthum, 2000, pp. 1-26). In addition, the wing-band of moths, butterflies, and beetles have two sets of structures called antennal club-plates, one set being specialized for light perception and another set for polarization detection that can distinguish both polarized and unpolarized light (Owadare, 1996, pp. 11-24). Yet other insects have a specialized olfactory system. For example, the locust’s antenna contains an area richly supplied with hairs rich in wax that absorbs the scents from flowers. In the fruit fly, antenna cells are endowed with specialized sensory structures and odor stimuli are detected in the antennae (Owadare, 2002, pp. 7-12). Also important is the insect’s ability to take up dissolved substances, as well as to sense their effects, in the mouth. For example, the tongue of honey bees is equipped with taste organs which use the olfactory system to detect the taste difference (Schaeffer, 2003, p. 20).

Invertebrates generally lack such sensitivity, such as the olfactory systems of moths. Many animals, however, have some special sensory ability to detect external stimuli. For example, plants have special structures in their roots, leaves, or trunks that perceive and respond to herbivore damage (Hobbs, 1990, pp. 22-29). In the caterpillar of some Lepidoptera such as the cabbage white butterfly or some moths, special structures on the dorsal surface are sensitive or responsive to mechanical pressure (Hobbs, 1990, pp.
