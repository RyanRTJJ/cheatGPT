 the Ultra Game Boy. Of those four sets, the Action Set is the cheapest and most complete. It not only comes with the system, 8 games included and a stand, but the full range of the NES’s peripherals, such as the Super FX and Paddle Wheel controllers.

At first you may be thinking that you wouldn’t want to spend a lot of money on a peripheral collection that costs around $100 more than the actual console itself. Why purchase more than you can use? But at the time, you couldn’t afford to get everything you wanted just to play one game so you had to buy everything, too. Today, you may not want to have all of the peripherals, but buying those that are a must for you — like the Paddle Wheel, for example — means it’s easier to get your money’s worth out of a complete package, especially if you eventually decide you don’t care for the controller. Plus, the stand and the original controllers are super rare now anyway so it’s a unique, collectible item on its own.

As with all video game accessories, it’s not just about collecting all of these peripherals. There’s also nostalgia and, for some of these, the joy of seeing your NES experience grow and evolve. Here’s a guide to each accessory that is part of the Action Set.
