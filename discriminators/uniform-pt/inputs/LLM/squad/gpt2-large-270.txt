 6,300ft. The total area covered is 7,600 sq km (2,750 sq miles)

More than 100 birds of prey

Birdlife is plentiful in the island chain, ranging from the pheasant and a red wagtail to the great egret, egret-tailed goshawk and starling. There is also abundant marine life. The largest of these is the great egret, which can measure up to 2ft (0.6m) long; the smallest is the puffin, which is often only one foot long.

Males have the most trouble choosing a nest – in part because of their small size, with the female having the power to choose the best nest in an empty place (although she can sometimes choose a different one on a rainy day). Females, rather than the males, have the most trouble choosing a nest, as they like to be alone foraging, and can be reluctant to let a male attempt to take his place.

Soaring, deep-sea fishing and snorkelling are popular activities on the Irish islands. There are numerous beaches and islands, some of which have even been built by wealthy English families (and now are open to the public).

A good variety of birds

Hairless, spotted owlets feed on crickets, while goshawks come to the Islands in the autumn. Pigeons can be seen anywhere on the Islands, and there are many birds of prey – including ducks, turkeys and geese (there are also other species as well).

The animals that people tend to find most interesting lie in wait
