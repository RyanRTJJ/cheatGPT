 a plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. There is currently a plan in place to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2020. However, it is projected that more than 60% of the carbon inventory between 2009 and 2010 may have been released to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.

Further, Melbourne is located within the state of Victoria and has a strong and experienced carbon mitigation plan. Victoria has a targeted target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 and this is projected to require reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 32% from 2005 levels by 2020, which would require net zero carbon emissions from 2030.

Melbourne is committed to continuing the path of increasing the level of investment and the number of megawatt hours of high quality renewable energy produced by Melbourne Power and its network partners.
