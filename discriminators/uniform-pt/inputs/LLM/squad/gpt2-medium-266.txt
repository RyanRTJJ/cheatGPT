. Coyle, John H. Nesbitt, G.V.N. Rao (also of Swinton's circle), were already discussing the idea when the Delhi Government proposed in 1970 a "subdistrict" covering the entirety of Indian-administered Delhi. As the committee prepared the application, they also considered a similar plan for Mumbai, which was eventually withdrawn and was replaced by a much larger, new town. With some slight alterations, Delhi Town was expanded to include all of India's major districts, which the committee had estimated would form a total of 2.7 million residents.

For the Mumbai City of the future, the Committee was aware that the size of the city would increase with the population increaseâ€”a major problem because Mumbai has a population density of 6.4 people per square kilometer. Moreover, the Delhi town would increase its size by some 2.2 million residents, but because of local resistance to large development, the committee abandoned its plans.
