The number of madaris rose dramatically in the Ottoman Empire over the next two centuries. According to the general census of 1850, there were 1,832 madaris in the Ottoman Empire, while the general census of 1872 indicated an increase in the figure to 2,734 madaris. At the beginning of the Ottoman–Turkish War of Independence, there were more than 6,000 madaris in Ottoman Turkey with 50 schools serving some 7,500 students. In modern history, there were some 14,500 madaris, out of which 3,500 were Turkish ones, 4,500 Muslim, and about 4,200 Christian, with more than 10,000 students. However, in the early 20th century, the number of madaris fell sharply and today there are only about 1,200. [For more statistics, go to the source for the relevant section.]

Despite the efforts to improve the quality of madaris, which have included increased training and modernization, the number of active madaris has declined in Turkey over the past four decades.
