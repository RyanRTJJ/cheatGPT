 adolescence. After that, the rules generally can be reversed. In the context of parental control (e.g., control of the television program broadcast to the family), research has found that adolescents were more likely to support their parents than were older children. They may be less dependent on their parents, as they have experienced their own control over a number of areas, including their physical appearance, lifestyle, and independence.[@bib1], [@bib2], [@bib3], [@bib4], [@bib5], [@bib6] This finding also holds true with regard to parental control in peer groups. In a study of 14- to 18-year-olds, Hagger and colleagues[@bib2] found that adolescents were less supportive of their parents, as compared with older children and adults.

Family control differs according to the age of the adolescent and the parents' level of education. In parents with low education, control of television may not be needed, yet they still manage to control it effectively, whereas in parents with high education, controlling the television program would not be easy, hence allowing adolescents to take control.

According to family systems theory, adolescents tend to be influenced by their parents' social class and their attitudes towards school.[@bib7] The findings of this previous study were consistent with those of a research study performed by Fokkema and his colleagues,[@bib8] which indicated that adolescents tend to be more controlled than older children and adults in non-parental groups.

In the present study, we focused on parental influence in a group of 15- to 19-year-old adolescents. The main purpose of this study was to find out if the relationship
