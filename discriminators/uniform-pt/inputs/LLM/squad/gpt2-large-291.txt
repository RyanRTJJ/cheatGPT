 texts on a variety of moral subjects, a new literature in its own right.

A similar transformation has occurred in the Western world. In the past decades, there has been much interest in Virgil's works, and perhaps because of their importance, many great poets whose first love was Virgil--John Donne, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Henry Fielding, and Thomas Hardy--have added poems to their collections. This is quite surprising for a body of work that should seem so obscure. A good example would be the collection The Aeneid, to be published posthumously in the first year of this century by Tintoretti and co-edited by Marcello Rucci and Paolo Cipolla.

In the past decade, a certain intellectual frenzy has swept the world, with poets such as Thomas Pynchon, Joyce Carol Oates, and Richard Powers all working to publish their own collections of Virgil. In short, all the works of Virgil have found their way to the public.

We expect much from a great poem from Virgil, and it is only natural that as he lived, he inspired us to create poetry of his. To understand the connection, the poet must first be explained.

It seems to me that for some centuries after the death of Virgil, poets were very much in love with him, and his works are now as highly prized as if they had survived until the time of Henry VII. It is impossible not to notice that for almost two thousand years, the best translations of his poems have been those of his contemporaries, and the popularity of his works may go back even further. This is true of his Eclogues and Virgil's Aeneid.

It becomes rather clear how one finds a poem from Virgil: the reader draws up a short phrase, which, by analogy with the rest of the poem, provides a poetic background. This, however, may not always be the case, and may be very
