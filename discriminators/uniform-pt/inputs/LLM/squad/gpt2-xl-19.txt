's chart history.

But, while a few years in the West Coast saw the release of another number one, with Dookie, the band were unable to establish themselves anywhere on the continent.

With a long-desperate hope of regaining lost ground, in 1994 the remaining members and the label began negotiations.

By this stage the band had ceased to exist as what began as a trio called Whitesnake were a group of three.

"I can't say much right now, but there has been some movement," said Coverdale following White Snake's first solo studio album, White Snake.

"There are a lot of things that will change when we see each other again.

"We hope to do it again."

In the past couple of decades the band (or "hypebeast" as it was in the era) have toured Australia, the US and Europe. They returned to America with the help of the Hollywood Bowl in 2008 and a reunion tour in 2009.

Since their last tour, the group had been recording some music but their hiatus meant their future was not assured to fans who hoped to see them back together.

In 2012, however, the group returned to the stage as the 'Sensational White Noise', with cover of Prince's 'Let's Go Crazy'.

Coverdale will likely remain in the public eye with work in the film industry and as an actor working under director Mike Leigh, but whether he is involved with Whitesnake again is unknown.

The band, though, are not ready to say farewell, according to Coverdale who said that being in a band is a "living death."

"Everyone else around the world has died, but you have to keep on living.

"I hope it can be a life, not a death."

News_Rich_Media: The Whitesnake reunion will likely take place later this year as the band are gearing up to release a new album sometime at the end of the month.
