 the initial German air battle had the same intention as the Luftwaffe's strategic bombing campaign — to support the ground offensive. Hitler intended a decisive victory by eliminating the enemy through bombing. He did not want to be confronted by what he considered his greatest problem — being outnumbered. He wanted to take the initiative away from the British and make the Luftwaffe's contribution count, while having German ground forces continue to advance.

The Germans had no aerial artillery on which to base the air offensive. There was little in their aircraft to protect themselves in the attack. The Germans had no night bombing, and, of course, no aircraft carrier — or at least none capable of taking off on a long-range sortie without assistance from an aircraft escort. As a result, during the first day of the Battle of Britain, the British gained a vital operational advantage: they had night fighter cover with their bombers, a force that reduced the range the attackers could fly over Britain. By contrast, the Germans had nothing but their bombers. This meant that they would have lost their ability to attack targets in the United Kingdom other than England as they would have been unable to maintain adequate sorties over Britain. For example, Germany lost a significant number of men killed or injured in attacks on England and Wales during the night of the 16th/17th March.

It is important to remember that the Luftwaffe was being bombed en masse, not only by the RAF but by other nations
