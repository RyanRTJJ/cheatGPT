The Yale Corporation — composed of alumni and non-alumni — makes the final academic decision on the appointment and promotion of faculty members. Faculty governance is vested in the Board of Trustees of Yale College.

Formerly known as presidentially appointed Yale administrators, college presidents now hold these titles as full-time or part-time and/or elected positions. The Yale Corporation (corporation), elected annually by the trustees, must consent to all faculty appointments.

The Board of Trustees appoints a faculty dean to manage the professional staff, provide a professional oversight of the academic work of the college, and promote collegial relations between faculty members and students. They also appoint the vice provost for research, and the head of the Office for the Vice Provost, the Associate Vice President for Research (provost), who oversees the office of the provost, the president's administrative assistant, and the assistant vice president for academic affairs, academic dean, and academic vice president (head of the graduate school).[2]

Yale faculty are divided among ten faculties, each comprising seven to fifteen department. Departments are not necessarily academic departments. They may be specialized units within the same academic unit, or non-academic departments. Each is run independently: only department heads and departmental administrators report to the dean of the faculty, and only the dean or the provost reports to the college president.

Faculty governance of departments is vested in departmental committees such as the Curriculum Committee and the Faculty Committee on Undergraduate Studies.[7][8] Faculty members appointed to departmental committees are usually members of the academic staff. They are frequently faculty members with professional expertise or teaching skills. They are charged with advising their colleagues on various important matters, and they may be involved in faculty governance of the department. Faculty members who do not hold teaching responsibilities in the department are not eligible
