.3 million people living below the poverty line — the highest number in the country, even higher than New Delhi when it was analyzed a decade before (1.2 million).

While poverty levels in New Delhi have fluctuated over time, poverty in Hyderabad has risen steadily. The state has seen a spike in poverty in the past two to three years. But at the same time, there has been some improvement. The rate of growth in poverty has slowed and is currently estimated at 3.9%. In 2004, when Gautam Bhattacharya was chief minister for the state, poverty in the state rose to 4.3%. By his tenure in 2011, the countrywide poverty line was raised to 5.9%, and Hyderabad also saw an improvement in the poverty line from 4.3%. The increase was even sharper in 2012, when the state witnessed a further increase in poverty to 8.6%.

The rapid growth in poverty is reflected in the figures of GHMC’s ‘Poverty Headline’, prepared by the state’s Economic Survey. It projects the number of poor people in Hyderabad (as per 2007 prices) reaching nearly 6.4 million by 2017 (an increase of 1.8 million from 2015). In 2012, the percentage of people living below the poverty line (measured by a price index of 50) was 12.4% — the highest in the country. In 2007, it was 16% while in 2004 it was 14.9%. The poverty rates in many states including Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh have also been high over the years. For
