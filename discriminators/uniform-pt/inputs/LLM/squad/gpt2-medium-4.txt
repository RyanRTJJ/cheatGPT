. The games in 2013 were played in Arizona, Denver, New Orleans and Seattle, which led the pack in preseason attendance during the 2013 season. The NFC East and NFC West were followed by the AFC North and AFC South, with the Bills at Buffalo in Buffalo and the Steelers at Pittsburgh taking place in Pittsburgh and Cleveland in Cleveland.

The 2012 pre-season is a bit different, as nearly half of the NFL's teams play the remainder of the regular season during their preseason. As players tend to come to camp on time, you can expect to see a lot of injuries; there were injuries during preseason for almost every position (with few notable exceptions like defensive end and outside linebacker).

For the NFL, preseason is a very important time for developing the best locker room, the team environment and players who can contribute to the team on and off the field. It is the first time a player gets to go through a year of training without having had any regular contact with the media, and the final piece to winning a football game without ever being asked to perform.

The pre-season games are, in my opinion, the best opportunity to see how the league stacks up against Europe and the NFL, especially if these teams have been developing really well over the last few winters. For instance, the preseason games in France were very entertaining to attend as some of these sides have had great teams, like Monaco, Marseille or Lyon. You always get a feeling of the pride that those teams take in their games and in their opponents. This helps to inspire their fans and keeps you involved and motivated all summer long.

The Patriots have one of the most exciting pre-season schedules in the NFL, winning every game from September 12 until October
