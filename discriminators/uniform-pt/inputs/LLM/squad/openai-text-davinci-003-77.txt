 must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The most common prize is a "contract" (traditionally represented by a document, but more often a folding chair, boombox, or moneybag containing "(imaginary) money") but can also be any object suspended Above the ring (often referred to as a religious artifact). The contract may give a wrestler a title shot, an immunity to a disqualification, or another type of advantage.

Another type of specialty match is the forty-minute iron man match. This is a timed match in which the wrestlers try to pin each other as many times as they can during the given time frame. The wrestler who gets the most pins (or submissions) within the time limit is declared the winner. Other specialty matches include cage matches, where a ring is enclosed with a steel cage, Falls Count Anywhere matches, which allow wrestlers to pin their opponent in any location, and tables matches, where a wrestler must put his opponent through a table to win.
