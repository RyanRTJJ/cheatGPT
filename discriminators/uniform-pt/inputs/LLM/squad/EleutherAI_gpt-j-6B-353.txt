 the country’s “microaggressions houses” which are places on college campuses from which minority individuals have to find “accommodations” in order to avoid being the target of offensive and insensitive speech. The students protesting Yale’s Calhoun residency house in 2015 used the same slogan that protesters at Yale College used a number of years ago when they were protesting the university.

Yale’s “race neutral” housing system, like Harvard’s separate but similar “safe space” requirement, has long had serious consequences. It was used on Yale’s campus for years not only to harass individuals of color and white women, but to harass and attack others with impunity.
