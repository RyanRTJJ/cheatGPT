 inches). Some varieties, with a very short bloom period, are less desirable for long-season production. Cotton is a fast and highly efficient photosynthetic plant, which requires a lot of water to remain active. In the south, the high rainfall may have a negative effect for cotton cultivation.

Cotton is harvested early in the growing season because the long days after a rain are very favourable to the plant development. Harvesting cotton early in the season provides a more consistent yield, but this often results in lower quality cotton. Harvesting early can result in damage to the plant and also makes it difficult to maintain the crop for next season.

Harvesting when the field is still cool is more favourable to the plant. Although the yield may be lower, the risk of plant damage is significantly less. Harvesting early is, however, not suitable for many regions in India. It takes too long for the plant to re-establish during the year.

Cotton plants grow in small groups in close proximity to each other. Cotton flowers are small and can be easily overlooked. When the leaves fall, they often drop off with them. Many plants can be damaged if left out of the sun.

Cotton is hardy to temperatures as low as -20°C (-4°F), and is therefore easily grown both inside and outside. Cotton requires moist soil, and grows quite easily and consistently with a small amount of fertilizer. For most regions, the amount per hectare range between 20
