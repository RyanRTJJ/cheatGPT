 1 September, 1965, the astronauts landed on a launch pad at Khomsomol Mountain, 5 hours above sea level.

Later, two of the astronauts were transferred to the International Space Station (ISS) at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, for the first time.

The crew then traveled back to Earth for their final rendezvous, which was held at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. On the next flight, the astronauts spent a total of 34 minutes between the orbiting module and the Earth's surface.

The spacecraft traveled at a speed of about 40 kilometers per second, a speed well above the speed of sound, which the astronauts were equipped with by then. The crew was able to launch using any of the main two rockets, but the last stage of the rocket was not powered when the Soyuz rocket went down. During the flight, the Soyuz rocket was also charged up and the propellant was then ignited. After each launch, in addition to being a solid mass, the Soyuz rocket was packed with liquid oxygen to improve it's initial density.

Once the Soyuz test program was complete, the crew returned to Earth to begin the flight to orbit. They then traveled to North and South Carolina, and then to the California coast.

On 28 December 1966, the third mission landed on a launch pad at Khomsomol, 5 hours above sea level.

On the 30th of September 1965: Four more of NASA's astronauts landed on their first orbital mission. Two of these missions took place between June and September of 1964.

During the lunar orbit of the Earth,
