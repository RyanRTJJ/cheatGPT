He also wrote extensively about the concept of hegemony, whereby he argued that the dominant ideologies of a given society establish norms of operation, and subordinate social classes will adapt their actions to those norms and thus consent to the power structure.

The work of Hebdige further explored the ways in which popular culture can be used to re-define and challenge dominant power structures.
