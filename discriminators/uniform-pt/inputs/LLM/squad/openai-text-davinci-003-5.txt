eferee stops a match is when the situation of the duel becomes unsafe, such as when a player is clearly losing and will likely receive an injury if action is not taken. Some rule violations may result in warnings or minor penalties, such as point deductions, and only in extreme cases will disqualification occur. In the case of cheating, cheating will result in an automatic disqualification.
