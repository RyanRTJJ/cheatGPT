In general, the results of the survey suggest that the standardization of several Eastern European European languages had reached a level of near perfection in those countries. This result contradicts the hypothesis that a centralized language policy is counterproductive and even leads to an isolation from the West.

In this light, the research carried out by the West European researchers is also worth assessing in relation to the West European language policy. Although the Croatian language is still the most widely taught one in the Netherlands and the Czech language is taught to more than half of all high school students, these two countries have hardly a similar standardization of their two mother languages (Croatian and Czech) compared to the language policy in Yugoslavia. Furthermore, it does not seem that the adoption of the three languages model has been successful, as both Croatian and Dutch are still very widespread compared to the other two. This suggests that, in fact, it is the lack of a common policy, as well as a lack of an active policy of teaching both of these languages as well, that keeps the Croatian language more widespread than Czech, and that it is the Czech language that is more isolated than Croatian. This situation is similar for the other two languages.

What this study shows is, in fact, the need for language-neutrality to be applied in Croatia: even though the language policy was more neutral than those in the countries mentioned above during the 90s and after, this policy is still in effect in Croatia today; the national language policy includes, for example, that both languages should be ‘part of the state language’.
