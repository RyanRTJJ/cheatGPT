 of his book before his death, and others continued to sell the copies after his departure, eventually leading to the English revision of the book in 1896 (see A. N. Thomson edition of 1794), with over 600 examples of this.

In 1899, the International Conference on Man and the Earth, held in Paris, revised Darwin's book and made numerous changes made due to the increasing frequency of publications. The Conference adopted the following:

The use of the term 'prehistoric man' was removed as it is used in other scientific literature.

The terms 'flesh-eating animals' and 'hominids' were dropped in favor of 'humanoids'.

'Modern man' or 'Man' was replaced by the term 'anthropomorphism'.

The word 'cranial development' was included throughout the book until Darwin had concluded that 'animallism is still the best explanation'.

These changes brought about a rapid development of scientific research by men and women with different opinions of what evolution might really have been, and by those who were simply looking for ideas to further their understanding of the world around them. Much of what Darwin read and wrote was presented in French, and his language has been lost to us.

While the book survived, and the scientific community continued to use Darwin's ideas to develop, the scientific community has completely changed the way we understand creation in the English Language. The word 'evolution', once used to mean "the process or process" and never to 'beget' a new system, is now used to mean simply "change or evolution." Evolution of human species is now taught as "the fact that many species share characteristics or attributes with one another, or at least are thought to have been once closely connected."

How can this have happened with Darwin's ideas,
