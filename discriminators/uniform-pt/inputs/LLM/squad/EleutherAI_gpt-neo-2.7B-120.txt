 initial encoding, consolidation and reconsolidation of memories, and retrieval (Kable and Bear, [@B11]). However, most studies focus on the short-term maintenance of memory while the long-term consequences (consolidation) have been neglected. Furthermore, how memory retrieval, an essential stage of memory consolidation, acts on its stored information has not been thoroughly investigated.

The phenomenon of learning and memory consolidation could be conceptualized as the following (Kable and Bear, [@B11]): (1) memory encoding, where a sensory cue (e.g., visual pattern) is associated with an outcome event or stimulus, and then (2) memory consolidation, where new and familiar, thus newly encoded associations (see Figure [1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}) are strengthened (i.e., they become more resistant to interference). The phenomenon of storage, as a function of consolidation over time, is a complex and multi-level process that is involved in learning and memory. Several neurobiological theories have postulated that consolidation (or storage) occurs as a result of (1) an active phase of brain processes involved in memory encoding and (2) a passive (or slow) phase where the stored information is protected over longer or longer time periods (Kable and Bear, [@B11]). However, evidence from animal and human studies suggests that there is an active and a passive component; the passive or slow phase of consolidation occurs over hours whereas the active phase is only temporary and only lasts for days (Kable and Bear, [@B11]). The passive phase is suggested to include an internal signal that causes the old information to recede
