The women I slept with were just, sort of, good friends. So I got some good lessons from my first woman friend."

Bobby Eichinger and Linda Sarsour have also been photographed together in public in recent years. Eichinger and Sarsour, the organizers behind the May Day movement of 2014, celebrated the historic rally held in the Muslim neighborhoods of New York City. Later in the evening, Eichinger was photographed at a prayer vigil with his wife and children outside Eichinger's former office.

What does the mayor hope will come of all this? To paraphrase Bill Clinton's famous line after being elected in 1992: "It's gonna take a miracle to win this thing."

There were hopes among certain sections of the conservative press that the president would soon decide to return for what they termed "Operation Rebuild" or "Mission Accomplished" or "M.A.R.L."â€”a reference to a slogan Obama had posted on his campaign website. The campaign website described a mission for Obama to "resurrection" the economy and to bring an end to globalism. One of the goals of the president's presidential administration would be to "drain the swamp."

But Obama's comments and actions in the weeks leading up to his inauguration have made no change in the fact that those in the Republican Party have decided that they must reestablish the right-wing ideological hegemony that he represented prior to him joining office in 2009.

If Obama's plans to reclaim the presidency mean that the American people will never see an actual election of someone like Michael Bloomberg in 2010, then he may just be the one who finally has a chance to take that chance.
