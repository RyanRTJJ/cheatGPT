 involving the raising of the siege of Caen with this aim of marching south to relieve the Château Gaillard.  However, the French army was able to bring their forces and the English army was defeated. Of 12,000 men in John's army, the majority were English. An English chronicler recounts that the defeat at Bouvines caused "great sorrow to the people of England", and that the French army captured "the standard of St George and great quantities of the arms and banners which they had taken from the King's own banners". It is probable that in this battle the English banner taken in France was used as a French standard.

Other battles
A few other English victories were won in 1205–11. John had allied himself with the King of Bohemia to the east and invaded France himself.  After a victory at the river Vermandois he took the Château Gisalle. The victory at Château Gaillard led to Philip leaving the greater part of his force with William Marshal while moving with a much smaller force to the relief of Château Gaillard.  William led the rest of John's army in an attempt to relieve the Château Gaillard. The French force which was encircling William had superior numbers, and the defenders of the Château Gaillard retreated after a short battle. The result was indecisive, and Philip sent troops to capture the Château Giraldo, which prevented William from reaching the main camp in time. Philip followed William in the direction of the town of Jargeau.
