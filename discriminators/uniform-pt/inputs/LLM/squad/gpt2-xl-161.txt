 with Greece as an attempt to break up the island of Cyprus. By the late 1866 World War I was drawing to a close and the Turkish Cypriots found themselves divided between two Greek governments. There was a feeling there that if the British Government did not allow them a say with regards to their own independence and the future of their Cypriot province, then it would be a step into the unknown.

The 'Greek Cypriot' movement

At the beginning of the 20th century the Greek Cypriots called upon Turkey to declare a united nation for the island of Cyprus. It was in this situation that the 'Greek Cypriot' movement grew and took shape in the first decade of the 1900s. Cypriots living in Greece objected to the Greek-Turkish union and saw Cyprus as a separate state, which they still hoped to keep separate.

In 1906, the Greek Cypriot leader Demetris Christofias proposed an alliance between the Greek Cypriots and Turks with one country as an end result of the union. The idea was to create an independent 'Cypriot Serbia'.

The Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Kemal led a similar movement in 1913 and proposed that the Turkish Cypriots and Greeks of Greece be united into a single state.

The 'Italian Cypriot' movement

During the second half of the 19th century, the island became more divided between Turkish Cypriots, Greeks and Italians.
