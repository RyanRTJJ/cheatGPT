During the early centuries of the Tang Dynasty, the area of modern Zhejiang was outside the major sphere of influence of the Shang civilization during the second millennium BC. Instead, this area was populated by peoples collectively known as the Manchu (Chong) culture whose language was derived from the Chinese Old Classic. The Mongols invaded China in the late 13th century AD and took control over much of northwestern China. The first period of Mongol occupation of the Chinese mainland was the 13th century.

The Mongols were defeated and driven from China in 1225 by the Manchu ruler Wu Ying, and the Manchu culture, with its extensive and sophisticated learning, was reborn. The second period in the history of the Mongols was the 13th century. In the 13th century, a Mongol army besieged and sacked the capital of Jiaozhou, which was one of the core sites of the Shang civilization. The Manchu culture died out and the central part of China became ruled by the Mongols.
