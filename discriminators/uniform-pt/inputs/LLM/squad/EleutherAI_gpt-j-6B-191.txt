 Engineers) suggest that college a cappella began with the invention of "the original cappella-style quartette" during the mid-nineteenth century. These early quartets were comprised of a bass, tenor, baritone, and sopranos. A contemporary report in the Columbia School Magazine in 1882 described a cappella performances as "the only style in which college men can give the best vocal performances." This style continues nearly unchanged today at more than 800 schools and it is widely accepted as the birthplace of college a cappella.

Other reports and journals corroborate the Columbia School Magazine's claim on several other occasions. One report states that "the best a cappella [musicians]... were organized in the College of Wooster in 1879" and later claimed that "the first successful college quartette was organized in Wooster in 1880". Both Wooster and the Columbia School magazine claim authorship of the first collegiate a cappella quartet to be "successful" (i.e. to have achieved fame and notoriety). These reports and others claim that this earliest organization occurred in 1880 and/or 1881. But, neither of these reports specify who might have been involved. The Rensselyres also cite two other sources, The College Year, and Ampersand Quarterly, each as evidence that the four-part collegiate a cappella quartet was established in the 1890s, though they do not specify the date.

With the exception of an anonymous source, all of the above claims rely solely on information provided by others. Thus, there is disagreement about the date and the originality of collegiate a cappella's invention. Nonetheless, the earliest source that appears to corroborate the claim that collegiate a cappella was introduced in the mid-late 19th century is The College Year, which was published in 1882.

The article in The College Year reads as follows:
