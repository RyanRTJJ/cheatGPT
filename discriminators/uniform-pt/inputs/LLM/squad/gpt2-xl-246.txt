 a type of mosaic which appeared on a tablet of the Roman emperor Hadrian from circa AD 100. Although its style is markedly different from the mosaic painted by other Muslim peoples, its composition and color variations are unmistakably Islamic.

The Umayyads and other Sunni dynasty rulers used more expensive and delicate artwork. This was the style of their predecessors, such as Abbasid dynasty caliphs Abu Bakr and Omar. As one Turkish historian noted, Arabic rulers "came to look upon the Islamic tradition with envious eyes". For all their sophistication, though, many Islamic rulers employed only a few decorative motifs such as the tawakkur (thrusting spear) and the kabira (the black hat or veil worn by women). Their works were far less decorative and far less extensive than those of the other cultures. One of the important reasons for this could be the high-ranking position of the Muslim rulers and some Sunni scholars. Muslim scholars had the ear of their rulers and they played a decisive role in defining the Muslim identity in the Middle East and in the Muslim world in general. The Umayyad dynasty was therefore more tolerant than the other Islamic dynasties in this respect, whereas the Abbasid rule was the most restrictive by a wide margin.
