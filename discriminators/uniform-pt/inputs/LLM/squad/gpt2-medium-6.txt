aro Velásquez de Cándido in San Nicolás de Santa Maria de Oviedo erected the great dome to celebrate the city's 150th anniversary. After the 17th century it also became the central building for the new Cathedral of Santa Maria de Oviedo. This Gothic cathedral was named "Huge of Oviedo" in 1874 and is not far from the beautiful cathedral of Oviedo de la Salle.

At its high point the nave was almost entirely covered in fine wood with the choir floor at right hand up to the first floor. A massive roof topped with the topmost tier of wood and with the top two tiers of plaster at the top were completed and covered over in 1768. The dome was partly covered in 19th century wood paneling and covered in plaster in 1781.

The exterior design of the Cathedral of Santa Maria de Oviedo was quite traditional and as such, the style was very conservative. It has no great ornamentations which has also made it very attractive. A wide variety of stained glass windows were placed in its main arch to reflect the richness of life in Oviedo at the time. Its structure was designed and built in the style of churches across southern Spain from the 16th century. This design was considered the best of its time and so the cathedral is the world's oldest cathedral. The dome is almost two meters
