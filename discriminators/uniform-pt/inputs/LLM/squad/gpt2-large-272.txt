ers of the era that have been modified for the purpose of typewriting.


The non-alphanumeric elements in the typographic character set were not derived from existing character-writing systems but were specifically designed to produce distinctive characters by the use of a standard system of writing, with no other modifications; their precise meaning were not intended. Such characters were selected by the designers themselves, but were not derived from existing character-writing systems. Each element of the typographic character set was named for the letter or symbol that made up the corresponding non-alphanumeric character. For example: the character C for the letter D, is a single stroke typographical character for the letter D. In the early years the majority of the U.S. alphabet was written with a single stroke for all the symbols with a value of zero, a very similar pattern to the pattern of stroke for D. With time more and more symbols were needed to represent each part of the alphabet and, through the use of the U.S. Census Bureau, a second character, N, was introduced. This character represents an N in any number between one and 10. N was chosen to represent the letter O, as an O in this position is usually represented by an N. The next character was selected to be a symbol that would be frequently seen: R. The U.S. Census Bureau has now created their own standard character for the letter R.


The types of characters that typography provides include (numbers): a single stroke for the number zero to 13; the number 14 is used for the digit 0; the number 13 is used for the number 1; and
