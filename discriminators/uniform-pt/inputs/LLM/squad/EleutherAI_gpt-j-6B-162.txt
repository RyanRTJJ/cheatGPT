 still present, the series also ended and started being referred to as the third season, the story being set after the events of the first season's finale. The fifth season, Digimon Frontier, aired from October 2, 2003, up to February 11, 2006; its episodes are split into two halves, and the first half ends with the events of the first season's finale. Six years later, the sixth season aired from April 5, 2011, to September 19, 2011.

Most episodes of each season are written by Junichi Fujisaku and Kenji Terada, with most of the script of each episode handled by Yuka Takashiro, although Fujisaku and Takashiro are also credited as series creator. A majority of the theme songs are performed and composed by Yoko Shimomura, with some songs, like "Wicked Dream", having multiple versions.

The third season's episode list was later confirmed to be different from the one in the official Digimon light novel, Digimon Adventure Adventure 02.

The characters of the original series were designed by Toshihiro Kawamoto, while the characters from Adventure were designed by Masaki Yamada. Several of the Adventure 02 character designs were reused, though only the original designs were re-drawn. In contrast to the Adventure series, which mainly focuses on the main cast, Adventure 02 mostly focuses on the rival characters of the original series. The designs are a mixture of the original Digimon and Adventure designs.
