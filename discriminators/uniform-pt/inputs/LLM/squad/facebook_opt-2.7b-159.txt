R Republic, Bashkir SSR, Kherson Oblast, Rostov Oblast, and Kaliningrad Oblast were invited to the joint signing of protocol regarding establishment of the SFSR and Byelorussian SSR Republics.
With the Soviet Union's dissolution and Russia's accession to the European Union, the border crossings between the two states in western Ukrainian have been opened for both customs and administrative purposes. This allows for the easier work of transit of goods through these regions, as well as the integration of them into the European Union. As a result, the new status of the regions was created with an equal number of ministers of justice, ministers of foreign affairs, ministers of economy, ministers of natural resources, and governors of all branches of government of both states. However, no constitutional changes were made. Until 1995, the official border crossings between Brest and Rostov Oblast consisted of two railway sections: a main one between Odessa and Rostov and a small shorter one between Odessa and Staraya Russa. In 1995, the Russian and Ukrainian administrations decided to extend this railway and to build the Byelorussian section as well. The border section between Staraya Russa and Chernihiv was reopened in July 2007. The border between Lutsk and Chernihiv was opened on March 20, 2013, and on September 4, 2013, the border from the city of Staraya Russa to the city of Chernihiv was opened.
