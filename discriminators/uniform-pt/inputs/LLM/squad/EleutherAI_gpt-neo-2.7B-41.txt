 Perkins about using his "very elegant instruments and instruments for the sounding of mines". Perkins agreed, and the two men set up a business venture to sound out mines in Massachusetts. The venture became a partnership agreement, in which Perkins got a 75 percent share in the venture, and Mather agreed to pay him for his work, about $70,000 ($917,500 adjusted for inflation) in 1718.

This was a substantial sum at the time in terms of modern-day currency. Mather's fortune increased tenfold during the decade of his partnership with Perkins. Together, at thirty years old, they were considered "wealthy men" and successful, respected, and influential at the colony. They had earned a reputation as wealthy men, as well as being known for their religious fervor. Perkins had studied at Harvard Divinity School, while Mather had earned his Master's degree from Yale (of all places!). They were "great men"; Mather was called the "greatest man in the world", as described by his biographer Richard L. Bushman in his book, Pilgrims and Patrons: The Puritan Encounter with Empire.

Mather used his wealth with great financial success for his religious ideals. He built a religious community known as the New Jerusalem in Boston in 1727, and funded it with money sent back to the colony during the winter of 1720â€“21. During this time Mather took an active role in the religious community by sending missionaries to preach to the Native American tribes
