, the social, peer, intellectual, emotional, and physical development of adolescents can be disrupted, as well as the ability to form strong relationships with others in their social sphere.

An adolescent's relationships (both within and outside of each of the social spheres) to their parents, teachers, community services, and other important people and institutions provide the environment in which adolescents can develop their critical thinking, critical judgment, ability to interact with others, and positive emotional states and relationships. These relationships may be disrupted, in part, by factors outside of the adolescent's control, for example, when the school, the school system, the local community, a parent, or others, influence decisions that affect the adolescent's social status and relationships.

School and Community Influence, and Their Effects

An adolescent's social status and relationships with others often depend on the context of the school, which is also one of the primary factors in determining adolescent social status. As such, influences are especially important for adolescents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who are more likely to face the disadvantages of poverty.

In schools, many children in lower socioeconomic classes are less likely to be selected for many, if not all, of the extracurricular opportunities available to students of higher socioeconomic backgrounds. As a result, those in these lower socioeconomic backgrounds sometimes have less opportunity than their peers to develop a critical thinking, judgment, and communication skills that improve their chances of success. Other factors may also prevent adolescents from being selected for certain extracurricular activities. For example, school regulations may prevent a school district from having an internship program for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, because some states have a ban on internships or student organizations. Other regulations may preclude the inclusion of student groups from which minority students are disproportionately represented.

Additionally, some parents, or others who have close relationships with school officials, may influence their children's academic achievement,
