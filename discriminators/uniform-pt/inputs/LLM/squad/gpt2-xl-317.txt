 Jerusalem, which does not contain the Old City (the city of which David is said to have built the temple), is also the sole jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in Israel. The other major Jewish institutions of the land, including the synagogue, are considered "uncompulsory" by Israeli law; a Muslim citizen is not allowed to visit them or to have them in his house.
