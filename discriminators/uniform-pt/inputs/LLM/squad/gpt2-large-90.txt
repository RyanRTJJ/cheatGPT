 tracks, or one uncompressed PCM track and four S-VIDEO tracks. CDs also may carry a DTS or S-DTS audio track but not a single S-track.

As mentioned, a DVD could represent a particular movie, e.g., the same movie released on multiple media. DVD is often stored in one compact disk, but is also capable of being stored in a DVD (the disc is a DVD or Multi-Die-Shed). DVD discs containing only a single version could be stored on two disc drives in a single installation. A multi-disc player could also be used to play DVD discs with copies of the same movie at two different locations.

Although several different formats and technologies exist for the digital media discussed above, the present invention is particularly suited to the use of the media described above, since a digital media medium can be implemented in many different types of computer hardware and software products and that some of the methods discussed in relation to these methods can be implemented in various configurations. For example, digital media may be stored for playback on a hard drive, a hard disk drive, an internal DVD or BluRay drive, a USB drive or magnetic tape drives, a solid state drive or various types of external computer storage media, such as floppy or tape disks, an SD or micro SD memory card and USB drives, a local computer storage medium or any
