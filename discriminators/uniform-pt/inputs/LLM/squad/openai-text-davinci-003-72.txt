 vassal states. This process was accomplished through a series of decree, laws and alliances that were enforced by two main methods: military force and royal marriage.

Military force was used to ensure that the king's orders were followed and to ensure that weaker lords accepted the authority of France. This was done through a series of campaigns, such as the Albigensian Crusade and the invasions of Normandy and Aquitaine.

Royal marriages were used to both bind powerful lords to the crown, as in the case of Eleanor of Aquitaine, and to tie together divided states by uniting the ruling houses through marriage. This method was popularized by Louis VII and his marriage to Eleanor, which brought Aquitaine under the control of the Capetian dynasty. Other royal marriages united Normandy and Anjou and secured alliances with foreign states. In addition to marriage, the Capetian court used a variety of incentive structures, such as grants of money and land, to support alliances, as well as bestowing prestigious titles to reinforce loyalties.

By combining military strength with diplomatic alliances, the Capetian dynasty was able to steadily extend the power and influence of the French crown until the entire country was united under one ruler.
