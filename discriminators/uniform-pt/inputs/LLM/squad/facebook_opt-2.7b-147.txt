 to have been brought to Europe from the Middle East, particularly in Spain, and were most certainly influenced by Arab culture. Some customs were borrowed from Persian and Arab festivals. The following table is taken from J.C. MacCarthy's 17th and 18th century books on Carnival culture.

Other traditions may have survived from past religious festivals to today, such as St. George's Day, which commemorates the slaying of Satan by Christ. During Holy Week, many people gather in churches for the Passion play.

In 1794, the Catholic Church banned Carnival from schools and banned the Catholic clergy from wearing beaded costumes and fez hats while in church.

The most important festivals in Spain and Portugal are:

Mardi Gras, of course:

San Fermín: (January 21, Feast of St. Francis Xavier)

Carnaval, also known as Caciques ("Jesters") and "Fábricas":

São Vicente de Jesus:

Easter:

The best-known and best-loved traditional carnival costume is the carnival fez, or headgear of the Portuguese Cacique, a colorful, decorated headgear worn on Carnival Sunday; typically the fez is made of felt, linen, or silk and is embroidered with beads, ribbons, ribbons, and flags. The fez is typically thrown onto people or crowds as an initiation to the Cacique's fraternity of jesters who must keep the mask on during the rest of the celebration.

Carnival masks have been a popular feature of masks in Spain since the 12th century (but see Bezoarded face/mask).

Some religious feasts are related to the festivals during Carnival: the feast of the Immaculate Conception, for example, is held on the Monday after Carnival (January 6, Feast of the Immaculate Conception) to pay tribute to the Virgin Mary, while the Day of the Dead (November 1, Año Nuevo) celebrates the dead.
