 in Albania. At that time many different villages and cities were established, which were governed as autonomous polities. Their main activity was farming and domesticating animals. Their economy was based mainly on flocks, livestock, crops, fruits and cereals. Cities like Elbasan, Berat, DibÃ«r and Prishtini are often mentioned in this period. A little later, in the 4th millennium BC, trade routes from the coast to the inland, were followed by the merchants and the artisans. At the end of the 3rd millennium the first metal objects from the mines of Dukagjin in Montenegro date back to this time.

Agricultural techniques increased. At the beginning there was the plough, but at the end of the period the invention of the stirrup and the war chariot was made. After the conquest of new markets and territories several cities and kingdoms were developed like in other parts of the ancient world like Egypt, Mesopotamia, Syria and North Africa.

In the 7th century BC the kingdom of Epirus began to expand. The area covered by the Albanian tribes was divided to several countries. After Alexander the Great, many tribes with their leaders fought for domination and started to organize themselves more closely according to a more centralized state. The Epirus region, along with the rest of Greece, was ruled successively by numerous rulers of the Greek, Aetolian, Illyrian and eventually Roman empires, until the 7th century AD when the Roman Empire annexed most of Epirus after the battle of the river Aous. A major reorganization of the Balkan peoples took place in the 9th century, when the Kingdom of Bulgaria conquered the Epirus, Paeonia and the northwestern part of Macedonia and incorporated them into its realm.

During the 3rd and 4th centuries BC, Epirus was ruled by the Roman Republic, the successor to which was the Roman Empire. In the Second Punic War, it fell to Hasdrubal Gisco who was defeated by Scipio Nasica
