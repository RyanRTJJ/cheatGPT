 and self-esteem the self is based on and guided by a social or personal identity. However, some people who identify themselves as being "outside" of this community of self-identities do not like this way of life.


So, do you identify with a self which is not in a sense the self? Or is it something that your identity and self-esteem have in common? What about your self-concept as someone, who doesn't care but instead is just a person whose identity is shared between others and friends? Or as someone who finds your behavior a form of identity contradiction or rejection?


In order to begin to take some deep-thinking and honest consideration of these questions, some things you have to realize at the outset is that there's a certain "otherness" that you cannot claim and not even recognize. When you see an identity issue or personality conflict, it's often best for you to look at yourself and ask yourself "what am I?", not "what do I really like about myself"? What is this otherness? How do I live my life and what does this otherness do for me?


This is a big deal and an important part of the problem being discussed and thought through is that some people have developed a self-hate or insecurity that is not considered valid by others. It can be very bad and could lead to you becoming even more isolated from others and that you don't actually understand their feelings and you won't have the benefit of being able to talk to anyone who shares them. But at the same time, this self-hate is something that I know my personal self or partner has been fighting and it cannot be a permanent issue because I've lost it in some way that I haven't seen or felt. Asking this question and letting go of this self-hate is simply not an option and many people are unable to admit this because they see it as the result of lack of self-love.


Of course, it can still be a struggle, but
