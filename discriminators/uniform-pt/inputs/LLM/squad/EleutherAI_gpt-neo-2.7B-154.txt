 analysis: one comprising European Jews, Sephardic Jews and their African-European converts, and the other, including North African Jews", where both groups were found to have more affinity towards European than African (Shenz et al. 2012).

The Jewish populations were found to differ in terms of admixture from their general population neighbors but they were not found to be significantly associated with their geographic regions nor with their specific religious background: Sephardic Jews from Spain, Morocco and the Balkans were found to be the most similar to Europe; whilst the African Jews were the least similar to Africa (the authors acknowledge this could be due to their low admixture from these other continents, making little sense biologically). They are also unable to confirm the supposed difference between the Sephardics and Berbers.

It is interesting that Sephardic Jews have many of their DNA characteristics similar to non European Jews, for example that they have a higher percentage of European DNA than non-European Jews. Furthermore, Sephardic Jews from Morocco showed a very higher European admixture than Arabized Sephardim Jews. The high proportions of European admixture were confirmed in the study of Mutter who showed similar proportions in Moroccan Ashkenazi Jews.

An additional study by the same study group confirmed there was a strong influence of Jews from Europe with more than 80% European ancestry in the study, whilst a much lower admixture from non-European Jews (up to 9%) was found in the non Sephardic Jews (Shenz et al. 2016).

Another study carried out by the same research group compared European admixture in
