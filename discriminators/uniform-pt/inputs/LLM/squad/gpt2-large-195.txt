 some cases, due to mutations, these essential fatty acids are replaced with other essential fatty acids.

The key thing to look for, when determining the best source of oil is not the oil source, but the oil's fatty acid profile. Different oils have different fatty acids profiles, meaning the type of oil, how it is extracted, and even how long the body has been exposed to it all can alter its fatty acid profile.

To determine the best fat source, scientists use some general guidelines, noting their oil profile, the time under consideration, when the oil was harvested, and the specific type of oil being used by the human body.

Different Fatty Acids of Your Favorite Oils

The average person has a variety of natural fat sources on any given day, but it all depends on how you define fat. For example, milk fats are generally high in oleic acid, which makes them a great source for people with an enlarged prostate. Conversely, animal-based oils such as olive oil or coconut oil are low on the oleic spectrum, so they're not a good source (though coconut oil is a bit better than coconut nectar, which has a low oleic ratio).

When looking at the fatty acid profiles of oil, the most important step is to start where the food comes from. This is generally taken by looking at the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids, often called the "fat/saturated fat
