 wide adoption in Europe, where it became known as the Pulsating Plate Vacuum Process (PPVP). The technique involved filling a vessel with liquid, the "bloom", and pumping a quantity of gas into this vessel to create a vacuum inside.

The method was soon refined and the vacuum pumps became faster and more reliable. They proved their worth when Swan's vacuum process gained market approval from the Board of Trade (BoT) in 1886 (as the Pulsating Plate Machine). Although the PPVP became an important commercial process, the vacuum pumps still lacked reliability in the long term so by 1892, Swan began work on a completely different type of vacuum pump – an improved steam engine. This new machine featured improved quality and reliability in the pumping process. A larger, more reliable and more powerful engine was needed to overcome the inherent problems of gas-filled pumps such as bulb blackening. The new engine – developed by Swan, the BoT, the Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE) among others – solved these problems and improved upon the PPVP by significantly reducing pump maintenance and improving reliability. Swan's 1892 steam engine (SAE class E10) was the world's first reliable modern vacuum pump, known around the world as the 'Swan Vacuum Valve Gas Engine'.

Other early pump experts around the world also joined Swan's company shortly thereafter. In England, Swan's company, Swan, Swan and Company, continued the work begun by earlier inventors such as Samuel Green, and developed a second steam engine to power a second 'Swanson Patent Vacuum Pump. The new engine, developed with patent rights in hand from the newly formed Swan Pumps Company, used better quality of steam. This allowed better long-term reliability while reducing maintenance.

Swan was also one of the
