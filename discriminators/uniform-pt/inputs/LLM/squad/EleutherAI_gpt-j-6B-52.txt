. They were formed as a result of the Manchu conquest of China in the 17th century, although not until the first decades of the Qing dynasty were Banner armies truly used as a fighting force, as the traditional Chinese dynasties proved to be too cumbersome to field armies of significant size. Although the use of Banner armies was largely superseded by Chinese armies fighting as regular national armed forces of China proper proper, the banner-army system had a considerable influence on the Imperial Chinese armies.

The banner forces were more successful than their regular counterparts in taking the field than their regular counterparts. After the Qing conquest of the Ming dynasty, banner forces in the former Manchuria led to China's
