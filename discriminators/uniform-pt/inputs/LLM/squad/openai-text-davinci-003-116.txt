Sulami was a Persian mystic and religious scholar who lived during the 9th and 10th centuries. He was born near Rayy, Iran and was a student of Abu ‘Abdillah Muhammad al-Nasafi, a prominent Sufi teacher.

During his lifetime, Sulami wrote several volumes on spiritual and religious matters, including commentaries on the Qur’an, theology, mysticism, and philosophy. He is best known for his major work, entitled The Garden of Lights, which is an esoteric explanation of the Qur’an. The book is considered to be the first full-length Sufi commentary on the Qur’an and is still read to this day.

Sulami’s works are considered to be the first significant contributions to Sufi literature and his influence can still be seen in modern interpretations of the Qur'an. His writings on mysticism, which draw heavily on experiences of human existence, still remain popular among Sufi circles and are used as references by learned scholars. Sulami is also credited with being one of the earliest writers to bring Sufi principles to a larger audience. His works spurred the early spread of Sufism in Central Asia, the Maghreb, and India.
