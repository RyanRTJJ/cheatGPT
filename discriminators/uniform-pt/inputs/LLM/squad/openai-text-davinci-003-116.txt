The economy and infrastructure of Britain also required substantial rebuilding after the war. In addition to facing the immediate challenges of housing Europe's displaced persons and refugees, the country was forced to redirect funds to absorb the destruction of vital infrastructure, housing and industry.

Furthermore, the conflict served to strengthen the ties between the United Kingdom and other nations within the British Empire, particularly in the Commonwealth of Nations. The contribution of the empire's servicemen, experts and resources during the war only furthered the unification of these nations under the banner of the Commonwealth.

In the long-term, these changes led to a great shift in the global balance of power, redrawing the Cold War geopolitics against a backdrop of two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. It also profoundly altered the country's culture and social beliefs, leading to a newfound sense of mutual understanding and cooperation in Britain.
