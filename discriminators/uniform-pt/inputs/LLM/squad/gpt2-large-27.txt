During their mission to the secret temple, the monks also visited a small, ancient Chinese temple known as the Great Wall which stood on what is today known as the Great Wall Street in the city of Dongguan.


Tibet remained under a Chinese puppet government of the KMT while the monks lived and trained at the Great Wall Temple.

He became aware that he had a growing group of followers who wished to see Tibet returned to Chinese hands and believed that the best way to achieve this goal was by peaceful methods.

Although his party made political concessions to the United States and other countries, its leadership did not make peace with the Dalai Lama and his followers. The KMT was divided, while the Tibetans remained divided, and the exiled Tibetan community split on the way to
