That's before the $110 million that the rapper earned that fiscal year on sales of her music, tour and other products -- something Forbes reported last week.

On a recent earnings call with investors, Beyoncé said she's been earning "well over half a billion bucks" for her new music, tour, TV, and film ventures. Her 2014 earnings were $55 million.

"We have a long term plan where we've actually got some real money coming in so it's going to be a good year," Beyoncé told investors. "We're on track to making a little something next year."

This is not something she's said before in public. In June 2011, Beyoncé had another press conference in which she admitted that she was being paid "almost nothing" and claimed that she wouldn't take money away from her career in order to devote her time to charity.

"As I get older, as I have more children, as my career takes off, I'm getting a little bit more time and the business and the touring is becoming a little lucrative for me," she told reporters. "As the business is expanding, we're growing. I think that's really helpful for me."

In addition to the new earnings, Beyoncé also has a $100 million deal with Vimeo. She also received $250 million from Nike, which produced the ad campaign. She also has endorsements with Marni, L'Oreal, Calvin Klein and the New York City Marathon.

Beyoncé's latest salary information was included in the 10-K filed with the SEC. While Beyoncé doesn't list an accountant as her manager, her earnings are managed by Jay Z's Roc Nation.

Beyoncé said she made $3.8 million in 2010, which included $2.7
