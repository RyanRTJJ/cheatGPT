 shutout in the last game of April, going eight innings and winning 2-0. Despite their strong starting pitching and solid bullpen, the Cubs still entered June leading the division by 15 games. As the season progressed and July approached, they seemed to be getting out over their skis. They finished with a weak July performance and by mid-August were no nearer to catching the Phillies. They then went on a 14-game winning streak from August 14 to September 13 to make it look as though they could be a legitimate threat, but by the time the season ended they had managed to put up a.500 record.

In the 1969 World Series, the Yankees swept Philadelphia in four games. The only blemish for the Cubs was an 8 run 7th inning stretch that gave the Philadelphia a lead they would not relinquish. The Yankees hit 4 homers to help carry the load and the Cubs came home with a 3-game sweep.

The Cubs returned to the playoffs in 1970, but even this team couldn't keep up a 100 win pace as they fell just short of the playoffs, missing by just 3 games to the defending World Champion Phillies. The highlight of the year was a 7 straight game series win against the Phillies to clinch the championship. The '72 squad managed just 4 straight postseason appearances before the end of the decade while the Yanks returned after a one year absence to win in 7 games over the Dodgers.

The Cubs won the NLCS in 1973 over the Mets to set up a showdown with the Pirates for the 1977 title. Pittsburgh won the first two games, sweeping the Cubs before the teams settled things in a best-of-seven (BOS 4-2 PHI). The 1977 Cubs had a chance in the 3rd game, but could only muster 4 runs against reliever Tom Seaver in a 5-3 defeat. In Game 4, the Phillies took home the pennant and would take a 3-game lead over the Braves for the division lead with just 2 games to play. As the Braves dropped series in Atlanta and Cincinnati to fall a game and a half out, homefield advantage in the '78 series hung in the balance. But as if the Phillies weren't nervous enough, their series with the Braves was being streamed in
