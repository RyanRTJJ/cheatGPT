udians. The black component at least was a small one, the majority of the population being white. In the post-war period, the Bermuda Census of 1959 shows a population density of 0.94 people per km2 for whites, and 1.09 for blacks; i.e. a density of 0.8 per cent of the island's total.

This chapter considers the period between the late eighteenth and twentieth centuries and the black Caribbean slave trade – both on the American coast and in the Antilles. The black slave migration to Bermuda by 1790 is the single largest movement of slaves during this period in English-controlled Caribbean. Unlike the slave trade to Jamaica, Jamaica transported slaves overland to English plantations, making Bermuda the main African port for a generation. When the slave trade to the Antilles was terminated by 1792, Bermuda became an important hub for the Caribbean trade. When the free Carib planters of Antigua began to move their slaves to Bermuda in the nineteenth century, the Bermuda slave trade was established as the major African slave trafficking route to the Western Atlantic region.

## The first major slave migration to Bermuda – 1790: the _Mallon_

The island's first recorded arrival of enslaved Africans in 1790 was a group of five black Africans on the ship _Mallon_ – an 11'6" long barque transporting Africans and others to the Bermuda coast. It had left the port city of Barbados (now Saint Elizabeth) on 25 December 1788 and set off on its hazardous voyage to Barbados. The port city of Barbados was then suffering from an influenza epidemic, with many deaths from the illness. On the voyage, at least 200 Africans died of influenza, mostly on the decks. Among the dead, many were children. In Barbados, the outbreak had reached its height; there were some 100,000 deaths and 100,000 in-fumatory
