 six seasons, including a number of new elements.

Catch-up services
The television rights deal for live sports were worth £670 million over six seasons or £33.3 million a season on average. The TV rights for matches available to the home viewers included the full FA Premier League, the top four tiers of league football in England and Wales and three international matches (European Championship qualifying rounds and finals, World Cup qualifying rounds, and the 1990 FIFA World Cup finals), in which the home country has the right to participate. The rights also included highlights and live international matches, excepting the football league competition. 
In addition, the agreement included the rights to one domestic cup competition, and a single-season domestic Super Cup.

Structure
A key element in the television contract was that Sky should cover all games held anywhere across the UK, including the Home Countries of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, where the broadcaster held the UK broadcasting rights. This has led to many high-profile televised friendlies where England or Northern Ireland was playing away from their domestic league.
