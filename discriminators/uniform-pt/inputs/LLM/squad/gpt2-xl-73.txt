 hunter-gatherer societies tend to be matrilineal and matrilocal, whereas modern industrial societies are mainly monogamous and polygamous.[50][51] The anthropologist Robin Dunbar has further noted that hunter-gatherers and farmers are not very similar, and that hunter-gatherers are probably better categorized as polygynous.[42] Although some anthropologists have claimed that "cows and dogs are like children to hunter-gatherers", in the opinion of Dunbar, "people with only one spouse, two or three children, or many more children are not like these societies". The distinction between domesticated animals and wild species is "an arbitrary one, in both directions", to whom Dunbar notes that "there is no apparent reason to draw it." Dunbar continues, "the same general pattern of sexual monogamy was apparent even among nomads who spent an average of only five years in any period of four years".

One of the early major works on human mating and reproduction is the early study, by anthropologist David Graeber, on human hunter-gatherers. He concluded that both polygyny and large families were common among hunter-gatherers, and that the large-scale social organization was based on the men having large and sometimes extremely numerous families, of which all the women were considered as their "custody chattels", regardless of whether they could legally own property within their own territory or not. Graeber also noted that early hunter-gatreemen, who probably lived in clans of between three and twenty men, engaged in sex with "all kinds of people, even wild animals, in case of any kind of emergency."[52] Despite these generalizations, however, anthropological and evolutionary studies have suggested that the relationship between
