 the Shang People under the authority of Shang dynasty emperor Shang-tze. It was in this area of central northern China that the Shang dynasty ruled for more than 400 years, and was responsible for constructing most of the major technological advances which have been documented in recorded Chinese history.

In other words, the Shang Dynasty was the last dynasty that made use of the vast intellectual infrastructure of China to develop the written word, including advanced tools such as writing, music, musicology, and grammar. The greatest achievements of the Shang dynasty in intellectual culture, however, happened during the Tang dynasty, which ruled for about 1,800 years from the fifth century BC. For years, scholars have been arguing over the precise exact date of the Tang period, and what changes took place, if any, in the way writing was used outside of the Shang. Recent scholarship however suggests that the Tang period may not have been the beginning of the modern period.

In other words, what we learn from historical and archaeology, while not entirely 100% consistent, indicates that we may not yet know the exact date of the Shang Dynasty's modern date of about 1086. With that in mind, it may be time to go back and read some more documents and try to piece together more information from them. And that is precisely what I plan to do. This journey is for the curious reader to seek out these documents, whether they relate to the Chinese or Shang. I have been fortunate enough in having the original documents that were presented at first reading from these documents and have been able to interpret everything and provide these interpretations in writing.

The "First Chinese Civilizations"

Ancient Chinese civilization, or a "first" civilization, began with the construction of civilization by the Shang people around 740 BC

The earliest written records of China date back from 700 BC, a time when the Shang dynasty
