 of the Iberian Peninsula.

By the Late Pleistocene about 160 million years ago, the region now used as a hunting ground for cattle, sheep and other animals became "snowland", a source of human hunting, says JÃ¶rg von Deltmann, director of the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Basel. "This period gave rise to various forms for various wildlife, including those of the eagles and porcupines."

The last known group of eagles was found at the southern entrance of the Dothan Sea, about 1.5 million years ago, but the animals were nowhere to be found in the northern regions.

But an early record suggests the earliest known eagles existed as far north as the Black Sea. About 1.5 million years ago, the black-tipped eagle was discovered in the southern province of KwaZulu-Natal; its population was estimated at about 30,000; it has been described as a 'pincer bird', a name that is now widely understood in Africa and South Asia.

A new analysis suggests E. arthropoda was a relatively recent E. arthropoda, and that the bird had never been found alive in Europe before the extinction of the dinosaurs in the Cretaceous, dating back about 40,000 years.

A new analysis, published this week in the journal Phytoplankton and Evolution, is part of a five-year field experiment, which focuses on understanding E. arthropoda's spread on the continent. The researchers also plan to study other birds in North America, Asia and Europe.

The team's new studies are part of several, which include E. arthropoda's emergence from the Black Sea, an area of the world where E. arthropoda is most numerous. They have identified a lineage from E. arthropoda that includes both large-bodied and smaller eagles, small pelicans, Eelas, and large-eared eagles, as well as more recent eagles including Eelas, Eeltes, Pterostella spp. and Eelias.
