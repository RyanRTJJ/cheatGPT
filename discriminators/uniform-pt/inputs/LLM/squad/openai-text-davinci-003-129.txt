 Carthaginians decided to cross the straits. The Carthaginians, however, were content to remain at home, though they did embark on a notable naval expedition that resulted in a clash at Aegates Islands in Sicily. The two forces met in what would become known as the Battle of Aegates Islands, and the Romans were victorious, effectively crushing the Carthaginian navy. With the loss of their navy and the prospect of a major invasion looming, the Carthaginian Senate sued for peace. Thus in 241 BC, the Second Punic War ended in Roman victory.
