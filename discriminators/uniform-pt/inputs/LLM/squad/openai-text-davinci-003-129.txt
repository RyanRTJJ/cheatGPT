the Hesiodic Catalogue of Women, Graecus is described as the founder of the Greek people. He, along with his brother Makedon, father of the Makedones, are credited with traveling to Thessalia and establishing a new culture there. Through their influence, this culture and language evolved into that of the Greeks. The Hesiodic writers also describe Graecus as the one who named the inhabitants of the region Hellenes after his own brother, in order to commemorate him. 

Graecus is also described in the Hesiodic Catalogue as a powerful figure in the court of Kouros (the son of Zeus and Leda), the ruler of Thessalia. There, he held various influential positions and participated in various events known to historians. Ancient traditions held that Graecus had a daughter by the name of Attika who married Aegeas, the builder of Athens. The Hesiodic writers also state that Graecus was the first of the great kings to worship Olympian gods. Finally, according to the catalogue, it was Graecus and his army that stirred the Trojan War by attempting to re-conquer the city of Ilion on behalf of the Argives, who in turn triggered the wrath of the goddess Athene. 

Graecus, thus, is one of the most important figures in the mythology of the Greeks and is a major figure among the legendary heroes of Ancient Greece. He is credited for establishing the Greek culture, language, and religion that became the foundations of the Greek civilization.
