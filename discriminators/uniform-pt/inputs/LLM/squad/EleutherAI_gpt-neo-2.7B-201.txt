 Liberties. This "Committee," under the general oversight of President Truman, made recommendations to the President on civil liberties and other matters, and conducted oversight hearings on civil liberties and civil rights issues. There was a shift in emphasis from state and local rights to civilian rights.

Executive Orders were also used in other instances where the President, to avoid the appearance of presidential favoritism, wanted to avoid public confrontation with the individual. For example, he could order that an individual be turned over to the Justice Department for possible prosecution, but not for arrest.

Traditionally the executive branch has not used military orders because the military has not had experience of carrying out law enforcement duties involving an order of this magnitude. As a result, there was substantial resistance in the military to using the Military Order and Title 10 authority for civil orders. Nevertheless, Presidents have relied heavily on this power, especially on occasion when it has been applied, in most cases under the authority to use military order, to carry out civil law enforcement.
