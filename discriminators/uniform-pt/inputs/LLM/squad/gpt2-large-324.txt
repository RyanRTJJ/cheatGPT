 level of an endangered species is more affected by an abundance of their prey, than an abundance of their predator. For instance, consider the relationship between deer numbers and snow in the US. An abundance of deer occurs when a predator is abundant. However, when snow is in short supply, these predators will be under pressure. This is particularly dramatic when snow falls in spring during a breeding season for deer.

We know, from studies conducted by scientists throughout the world, that snow provides food for a variety of prey species, including alligators and alligators at the expense of other large carnivores, bats, penguins, and dolphins. Moreover, we know that species at risk of extinction have adapted by migrating to higher elevations in order to escape predation. These birds, which have more efficient migratory routes than they have in the past, have an easier time surviving in the highlands of the Rockies compared to other species, which migrate uphill to reach higher elevations. There is no clear correlation between the number of snowflakes falling in a day and prey abundance, and to date no clear correlation between the size of an entire snowfall and the distribution of populations of a particular species, due to a lack of available data on snow cover. However, it is a well-established fact that large snow showers (like in spring, the breeding season for North American alligators) are significant factors in predator-prey relationships.

The effects of snow are particularly important in the arctic. The ice shelf that forms the barrier between the Pacific and Arctic oceans, located off of Alaska, is now under serious threat of melting. The arctic tundra is home to an estimated 30 percent of all land-dwelling
