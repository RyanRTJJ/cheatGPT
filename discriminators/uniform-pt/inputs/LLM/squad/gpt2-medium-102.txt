Lodge, Montana - the First European School

The oldest school in Montana and the earliest one in the U.S. It was opened by the Mennonite Church of Saint Louis in 1859. It was built with bricks in limestone and clay. This school was the oldest in the area.

The lodge was created after the town was founded. A group of students in 1882 lived at what is now St. Helens.

Lodge is still a tradition of the Mennonite Church of Saint Louis today. It became a Christian school through the activities of a teacher named Mary Rineke. She was a pioneer in working with Native children and teaching them to read and write.

In 1883, the lodge built a new building, the first building in the entire area. The building has a large stone bell tower, some of which is still standing. It has a large central hall with a white wooden roof. A fire pit sits atop the hill. Another building in the area has the Mennonite name in bold letters in a block of stone. The original stone bell tower remains. In the 1930s two buildings were built over on that land. Two older people were married at this old house and built a house near the lodge. The lodge is still recognized today for the many Mennonites they hold in high regard.
