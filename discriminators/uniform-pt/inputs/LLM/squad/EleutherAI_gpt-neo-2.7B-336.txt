asan, Ambraga and Kukulcan) who were heading outbound, so he decided to go around the groups. It didn't take long for Kurita to detect a group to his right (probably the same as the group of three). The group Kurita was in had made up roughly 20 metres of water when the _I-10_ (R. C. Thomas) passed to the left of it. Then a small boat with two men in it (Nagao and Nakatsu) was found. Both of them were in their 20s and dressed in what was supposed to be Japanese uniforms. The ship passed to the right of the group Kurita was in. Kurita was wearing a black raincoat and carried a single raincoat (unlike his other raincoats which were tied neatly over his shoulder). Kurita made it around the first group and caught sight of another group, this one in the opposite direction. The two groups were separated by an island in the Pacific Ocean about 600 metres long (1,000 metres at the water's surface). Kurita went back over to try and locate the group Kurita was in (whoever it was). That is when the _I-16_ came to Kukulcan's attention and alerted Kurita to his predicament. Both groups were being approached by two fast boats, one bearing down on the right and another with which Kurita had come.
