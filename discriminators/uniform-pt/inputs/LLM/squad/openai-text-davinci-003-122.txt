. Brodie and Lutyens as vice-chairmen, began looking for possible sites.

Various sites were considered, including Raisina Hill, north of Siri Fort and along the southern ridge – the vast forested range eastward of the ridge. Finally, on December 15, 1911, Viceroy Hardinge announced that the new imperial capital of India was to be built on the Raisina Hill, between the Delhi ridge and the Yamuna River. It was also decided that the government houses of the Viceroy and secretaries of state, and other important government buildings, were to be located on Raisina Hill.

Lutyens was given the responsibility of preparing the plan of the new city and from December 1912 to April 1913 Lutyens along with his assistant, Henry Medd, and the Delhi Town Planning Committee went about the task of drawing up plans for this new imperial city. It was around this time, in 1913, that the plan for New Delhi was finalized.

The Capitol Complex is the culmination of Lutyens’ grand new imperial capital city of Delhi. The Viceroy’s House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan), the Secretariat buildings and the Houses of Parliament form the core of this grand monument, which stands today as a testament to Lutyens’ skill and vision.
