 in the east of China. Among these "Five Barbarians", the White Di people were most dominant and they established the second southern Chinese dynasty, the Liu Song dynasty (420–479).

The White Di people were believed to have migrated from the western part of China, and were the primary inhabitants in the region before the establishment of the new dynasty. They were led by general Liu Yu, and their primary language was the Eastern Old Chinese. 

The White Di people had a strong influence on the politics and culture of Liu Song dynasty. They contributed to its development: for example, the White Di people established a military system called jin (金), which was used to strengthen their control over their territories. They also unified their administrative organization which helped the growth of the dynasty.

Moreover, the White Di people also added their own customs and principles to the Liu Song culture: they developed a unique painting style called "White Di painting" and their musical instruments, musical styles and musical pieces were distinctive. Their art, along with the revived Confucianism, was a major factor in the prosperity of Liu Song culture.

There exists debate as to who exactly the White Di people were: some believe they were descended from the Loulan people who had migrated to China in 2nd century CE, while others maintain that they originated from ancient tribes in the south of China. It is still uncertain, but all agree that their contributions to the Liu Song dynasty played a major part in its prosperity.
