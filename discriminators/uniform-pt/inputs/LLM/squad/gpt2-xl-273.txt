As the contents of the stomach begin to leave, it slowly starts to shrink. The speed at which it shrinks varies with the number of calories that enter the stomach. When the stomach has absorbed a certain amount of food, it expands again. In the process of expanding again, the gastric contents expand, increasing space and shrinking. The stomach then continues to shrink until the stomach is half its original size. This second phase of digestion is called the gastric phase.

From its half-way point, the stomach is one-half its original length. The stomach then continues to shrink for about three minutes before the liquid in the stomach is completely emptied out. This second phase of digestion is called the gastric phase.
