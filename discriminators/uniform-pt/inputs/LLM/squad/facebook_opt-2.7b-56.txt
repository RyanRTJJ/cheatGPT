 as founders in a few dozen generations. But such models predict that all Jews worldwide would share the same Y DNA.

Yet the genetic data from Y DNA studies are inconclusive. This raises the question of what causes Jews to possess different Y DNA that varies from region to region and within each country, even within the same region.

The researchers, led by geneticist Raffi Sabet from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Columbia University in New York and the Max Planck Institute of Human Development in Jena, Germany, focused on Y Chromosomes from the “Ashkenazi” or “Eastern European” population for their study. Because Ashkenazi Jews are often depicted as having different Y DNA from the other Jews, the researchers wanted to know why this Y DNA is genetically distinct from the Y DNA of the rest of the world.

“We wanted to know how much a person’s Y DNA is genetically shared with other Jews, and to what extent the rest of the world has the same Y DNA as Ashkenazi Jews,” says Sabet, who is also an Adjunct Professor of Genetics and Cell Biology at New York University.

The researchers combined the genetic data of two groups of people that have different ethnic backgrounds and are therefore expected to have different Y DNA. The researchers used a well-known method called the Mendelian
