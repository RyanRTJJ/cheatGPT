Annelids are polychaete echinoderms that have been around for 400 million years. A vast assortment of different species exist worldwide, but only a small subset of these species are preserved (Annalidea). Because annelids are soft-bodied, their fossils are rare (Annalidea).

A few species of annelid have the ability to burrow, to move along the seabed with a tube made of muscles, or to shoot silk from their mouths. Several species of annelids use their mouth-parts for piercing prey and then grasping their prey with their mouth and tentacles. A large group of polychaetes use their bodies to create a network of holes in the rocks that they inhabit in order to get around and collect food.

The following are several annelid species whose fossils have been found and described in detail:

Aspideidae

Aspidoscorum - Found off the coast of North America in the Gulf of Mexico.

Cyrtidae

Cyrtoscorum - Found off the coast of South America in the Caribbean.

Ctenacanthidae

Cythereochromis - Found in the Gulf of Mexico.

Ctenophoridae

Daphnia

Daphnia are a small group of carnivorous aquatic larvae of the class Chordata. Their larvae are carnivorous and feed on small detritus. Daphnia have an elongated body with a tubescence at the front that surrounds its head. Their external shell is formed by a hard tube that surrounds the body. Their feeding tubes form holes that allow them to collect food. When feeding, they are often seen as an assemblage of tubes in the surface of water, hence the expression "daphnia troika." They move along the rocky seafloor to feed and burrow into the substrate.

Daphnia are often found in water, especially when an area is rich in detritus and food rich in
