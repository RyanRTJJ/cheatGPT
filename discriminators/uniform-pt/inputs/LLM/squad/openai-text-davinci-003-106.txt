 response, the government created educational, training, and economic support for African Americans. The administrators and advocates of Reconstruction also worked to extend civil and political rights to African Americans, including voting rights, access to government-backed loans, and rights to own and inherit land. In addition, they designed measures to ensure African Americans had an equal chance at employment, and created the first affirmative action programs to encourage employers to consider African American applicants without bias.

In the twentieth century, affirmative action policies continued to be implemented across the nation, and groups such as the NAACP and other organizations worked to further the cause of justice and equality. These efforts led to the passing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which stated that the federal government “may take affirmative action to assure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” 

Since then, a variety of affirmative action programs and initiatives have been created for different targeted communities, including women and disabled people, as well as different racial and ethnic groups. These include recruiting initiatives, preferential hiring methods, and opportunity programs for university admissions. 

Today, affirmative action remains an important tool for promoting equality and justice. It’s an important reminder that although we have made great strides, much work still needs to be done to ensure a more equitable future.
