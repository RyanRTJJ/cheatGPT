lavas of southern India, and the Rashtrakutas of the Deccan. The Gurjara Pratiharas held the most power and were the most dominant of these three, ruling from their capital at Kannauj in modern-day Uttar Pradesh. They reached their height under the rule of Mahendrapala I, who expanded their territories into northern Gujarat and Rajasthan, as well as being involved in campaigns in the Punjab region.

The Pallavas had their capital at Kanchipuram in modern-day Tamil Nadu, and extended their influence into coastal Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. They fought against the Chalukyas of Vatapi and the Kalabhras of Tamil Nadu. They reached their height under Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century, who built the famous shore temples of Mamallapuram.

The Rashtrakutas based their domain in the Deccan, ruling from their capital at Manyakheta. They first achieved prominence under the rule of Dantidurga in the 8th century, who was able to conquer much of the Deccan. He was then succeeded by Krishna I, who greatly extended their influence and added the Pallava kingdom and much of the Chalukya kingdom to the Rashtrakuta realm. His son, Amoghavarsha I, was able to extend their influence even further and create one of the largest empires in Indian history. However, their power began to decline in the 10th century, when they lost control of their sphere of influence to the rising Chalukyas.
