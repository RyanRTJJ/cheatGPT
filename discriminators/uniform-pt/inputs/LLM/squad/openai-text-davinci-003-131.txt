Following the decline of the Abbasid caliphate and the Mongol invasions, the Safavid dynasty was established in 1501. This period marked the beginning of the modern era of Iranian history and the establishment of the Iranian state based on Shiite Islam. The Safavids codified laws, created institutions, and revived Iranian national culture, allowing Iran to be one of the strongest and most unified powers of the 17th century. The reign of Nader Shah also heralded a period of Iranian unification and prominence.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Iran experienced several periods of reform and modernization, with Reza Shah Pahlavi and Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi playing a significant role in these changes. The latter established a strong pro-western autocracy and initiated several major reforms and modernization efforts. This period also saw the development of secular education and increased participation of women in public and political life. The 1979 Revolution marked a major turning point in Iranian history and continues to shape the countryâ€™s politics and culture.
