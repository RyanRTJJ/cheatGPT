able to mount a strong antigen response due to underdevelopment of their immune systems while as they grow older, their capability to respond to an antigen increases. The efficiency of the response is dependent on the kind of antigen being presented. Antigens that can be recognized by the innate immune system such as bacterial or viral antigens are more easily responded to than those of different classes. The presence of maternal antibodies can decrease the ability of the body to respond to an antigen as the maternal antibodies can block the response. Finally, the presence of the antigen varies depending on the region as certain areas may have stronger or weaker antigens circulating throughout them.
