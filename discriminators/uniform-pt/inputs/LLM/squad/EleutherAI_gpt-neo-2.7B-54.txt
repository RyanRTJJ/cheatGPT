 of at least 45,000 soldiers. That is to say, the total number of military troops fielded by Hideyoshi is 40 times that of Japanese soldiers deployed during the invasion of Nanking, and also 40 times that of the army of the Japanese empire mobilized at Shimonoseki and Hiroshima.

Hideyoshi's army of 45,000 soldiers had to deploy the utmost secrecy and secrecy is a very important strategy for Hideyoshi to successfully invade Korea through the Korean peninsula. Hideyoshi's secret invasion plan was classified for one and half years and then revealed by the Japanese emperor, Hirohito, to his trusted generals, who planned the Japanese invasion of Korea.

During one of the Japanese invasions the Japanese emperor had assembled an army of over 500,000 troops to invade Manchuria, but the invasion was postponed due to a diplomatic controversy between the Chinese emperor, to whom Hirohito was formally appointed viceroy, and the Chinese leader, the Qing emperor, Taizong, which, resulted in the Japanese imperial army being dispersed in Manchuria. The Japanese army, however, invaded Korea in 1497 after the Chinese army, under Yung Yung, was beaten to a pulp by the combined Japanese, Korean and Chinese troops in the Battle of Noryang (also called the Battle of Anpwang).

The Korean emperor who defeated the Japanese invasion in 1497, had not yet ascended to the throne as he was still in the custody of the Chinese emperor. The Korean military commander in Manchuria, Kim Yeon, who defeated the Japanese army at Anpwang, was still a vassal of the Chinese emperor. The Japanese army had lost an estimated 40% of its initial army during the first encounter with the Korean armies in 1494. The Japanese army, at the time, was only about 20,000 strong, and with only a few hundred left at home, that figure of 50,000 or so was not enough to invade Korea. Hence, Hideyoshi sent his armies to invade Korea for another one year and half, which is known by the Japanese as, K≈çgen.

The Japanese army was so large that Hideyoshi's generals had to deploy the absolute utmost secrecy when they marched to Korea
