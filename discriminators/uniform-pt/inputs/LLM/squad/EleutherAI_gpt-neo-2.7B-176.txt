 Sun journalists Rebekah Kwan and Craig Anderson; former staff editor Tom Mockridge, who was charged with four counts of misconduct for giving police evidence in exchange for immunity; deputy editor Matthew Parris, who was charged with two counts of misconduct for accepting gifts, including a £50 bottle of whisky and a Rolex watch; and current editor Jon Scott, who was charged with two counts of misconduct for giving police evidence in exchange for immunity. They were represented at the first hearing by the defence lawyer David James, QC, while the trial team consisted of three retired High Court judges; Peter Beck, LMC; David Willey, and Mark Bennett, LRCM; and one solicitor, Stephen Stoll, QC.

In October 2015, the court formally dismissed Stephen Stoll from legal representation, at which point he withdrew as counsel. Peter Beck and Mark Bennett, who provided a different defence team at the preliminary hearing, continued to represent the six.
