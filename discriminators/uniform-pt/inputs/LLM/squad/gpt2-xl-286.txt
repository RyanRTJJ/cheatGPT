rianism to Islam. This conversion was done under the auspices of the Persian caliph and his nephew Muhammad ibn Ali, who succeeded his predecessor Muhammed al-Ammari in 636 AD.[2] The Rashidun Arabs were later also influenced by Berber converts and their religious leaders. In addition to the Berbers, Arabs, Persians and Sefardians converted to Islam.[2]

Among the Muslims, the word Islam means "submission" and "to be in God's obedience", and the concept is described by Muhammad as "submission to God, submission to His will, submission to the law of God. The believer's entire life is subordinated to Allah's will, which is the sole basis of his life. He submits to God before all elseâ€”before family, friends, his own wife, a nation, and God himself."[3]

As the Arabic word Islam refers to "submission to God", the word Muslims, also used in English, may be translated as the "people of the Book", or simply "the believers" and is also used in the name of certain groups and societies (often as a euphemism for Muslims in modern times) such as the Ahmadiyya Muslim community of Pakistan and the Baba Sheikh Islamic Mission Society of North America in the USA.

One should note that Islam is not a monolithic religion. Many major schools within Islam reject all forms of slavery and sexual abuse of any form, including child, and view this as a sin.
