 late 1960s, three such records were patented and produced by Audio-Technica.


The new records are constructed to resist the "breakage or mechanical change due to movement with respect to a fixed backing surface". In their application, the records must be manufactured to a standard, which was defined in 1965 in terms of weight, size, material and color ("B.M.C.B. Standard Specifications for Electrically Transparent Records"). There is some confusion and conflict as to the specifics of standardization. These records were made of a non-reversible, chemically rigid plastic called Polyvinyl chloride (PVC).


The records were also called "unbreakable" recordings, as it was believed that record stores would refuse to sell such records (the company that made the plastic, DuPont Chemical Corp, had filed a patent application for the material and production of PVC plastics, but it was not issued). Vinyl Record Recorders:


Records on an electric phonograph system record sound only on the record surface. The grooves are cut or punched to record the sound that is being recorded. In a vinyl record, they record the sounds that a stylus picks up from an electric drum pad on which the sound is being recorded. These grooves are cut at 45ï¿½ angles to minimize the time delay between the sound having been recorded and the grooves having been made. With this groove pattern, the recording will sound the same when played by someone close by, or if they play it on their turntable on the wrong turntable. In a vinyl record player, the stylus is a rotating stylus made of metal. Since a vinyl record player will read the groove pattern, the
