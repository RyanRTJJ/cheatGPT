Epinephrine is also used to treat fever, for instance, by causing an adrenaline rush, and it helps calm people down. However, the chemical has side effects, particularly in people with certain heart and blood disorders, which makes it often abused and misused.

"It's like a candy that can go horribly wrong," says Dr. Burch at the Department of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. "Theoretically, it should be used for some purposes—the emergency room is not a good use of the drug—but as we've seen lately with stimulants or painkiller medications, addiction can take precedence."

On one side is a small group of doctors who consider epinephrine safe, although the effects may be temporary.

"The more likely reason for people using epinephrine inappropriately is that they are feeling bad, and then their doctor is going to say that's okay because you're getting full of adrenaline," adds Dr. Burch. "You want to feel better before you give an EpiPen."
