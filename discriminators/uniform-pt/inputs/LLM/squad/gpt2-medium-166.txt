 populations through molecular geneticist's. This scientific revolution greatly expanded our conception of the human species through molecular methodologies and, as such, "race" became an accepted term. It is also the logical outcome of the theory of evolution, which has become intertwined with the theory of "racial difference". Yet, these terms have become so common and so important because of their association with race, that we must now ask, "are races really race, or even racial difference?", a question that has become even more complex since the "war on terror" broke out.

In this regard, I will begin by discussing three recent developments in the academic world which in theory have turned out to be controversial but at least somewhat useful for clarifying how we interpret and categorize racial difference and suggest ways of using these terms within a broader framework of racial differences.

First, an extended description of "racial differences". The most common term for this is "racial differences" and I will use it here only for completeness.
