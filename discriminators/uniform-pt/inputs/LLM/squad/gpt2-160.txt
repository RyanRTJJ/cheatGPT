 own main cities, the second city being called Thessalonica. It seems that they settled in a smaller, and less important, city named Thessalonica after the famous goddess Dionysius, goddess of war and chaos. The main city of the Hellenic city-states was called Noldor (or Vatnia), however, it appears it was called once after Noldor as a common city in Phrygia and in later years this name was later abandoned. By the sixth century it was called by some as Neuschwantho (or Nerevartho) and its name was also used as a common Greek name, but for reasons that have yet to be revealed the name was abandoned. Some claim it was a Greek language, however in Greek the city was also called Merebai (e.g., Romulus, Thessalos, etc.) and in Greek the only common Greek name found in the Greek language was that of Norgathos (which it is today) so that one couldn't write the names away.

At the date of the discovery, the Greek, Greek language was apparently destroyed on the fifth and sixth century BCE, though the Greeks did eventually regain some of their ancient rights. This may have been because the language was not thoroughly understood in the six to eight centuries after it was discovered, but perhaps during the centuries after that it was simply too complex to write, or it was just too complicated and not suitable for writing. To date the Greek alphabet has survived, except perhaps a few of the symbols used. There have at least two letters, a consonant and a syllable.
