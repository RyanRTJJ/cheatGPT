.e., they can add electrons to other molecules). To counteract the toxicities of free radicals, cells employ a variety of antioxidant protective systems. Among these, the thiol/thione antioxidant system is significant as the source and the main controller of a class of important cellular metabolites, known as the glutathione (GSH) family. The importance to antioxidant systems is revealed by deficiencies that result in a range of human afflictions, including but not limited to, cancer, autoimmune/inflammatory disease, cardiovascular disease, and neurological trauma/disease, such as stroke, neurodegenerative disorders, neuropathic pain, etc.
GSH is produced by the liver (˜60%) but also occurs intracellularly in most cell types. GSH is a peptide containing the amino acids cysteine and glutamate, in which the cysteine moiety functions as the thiol (SH−) group and the glutamate moiety as the thione (SH+) group. When reduced, i.e., to thiolate (−SH), the cysteine side chain contributes to disulfide bonds with other thiols (R-SH). GSH is a potent antioxidant and provides a major cellular defense mechanism against the toxic effects of certain free radicals. However, GSH's antioxidant activity is dependent on the redox state of the cell and as such it is sensitive to changes in cellular environment or redox status. Thus, while GSH is a major component of the intracellular antioxidant system, in the presence of oxidizing conditions, it rapidly reacts with a broad spectrum of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), including hydrogen peroxide, superoxides (e.g., superoxide radical O2−), hydroxyl radicals (OH•),
