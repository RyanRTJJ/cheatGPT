 today. Farming would be present for centuries and spread around the Mediterranean before and after the Neolithic arrived there (the period between 3500 and 2300 BC) and entered Central Europe in the 3rd millennium.

An additional event to the Neolithic revolution is the appearance there of the first pottery and agriculture in the area, in the 8th millennium BC. The first Neolithic peoples are found also in the southern European countries (Portugal and Spain) in a period starting around 4500 BC - 3000 BC) and spreading all the way to Iran, as reported by the dating of archaeological material, from mummies and ceramics. That period lasted for thousands of years and the area was occupied by the Neolithic, Iron, and Bronze ages.

The new archaeological site that would later be called Vashtëm (located between the rivers Koshk, Dërmi, and Alinjë) was discovered in 1971 by M. I. Zoloboj and P. D. Krapina who were both archaeologists from Tirana. An initial excavation by the excavation director M. J. Zogolli from the Museum of Material Culture at the Zagori University of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sculptures and Rock Art found that in 1971, a layer of black and gray limestone was exposed.

The site was then explored by Zogolli in 1973 who took a photo of a layer of limestone which came to be named "T" and which can today be distinguished as being of archaeological importance and of a type which is rarely found in Albania. The initial results from this exploration and of the preliminary study were published in the book The Vashtëm Excavation: 1975-1978 which gave the names of the new archaeological site called Vashtëm.
