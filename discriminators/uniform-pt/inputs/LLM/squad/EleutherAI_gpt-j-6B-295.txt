Although Sputnik was unsuccessful, and it was discovered that its radio transmissions could not be read by the ground, the launch was a breakthrough in that it allowed Western civilization to see how far the USSR had traveled and how committed it was becoming to science. While the United States was still deciding whether or not to continue with an effort to put a person into space, the Soviets were already sending their first man into space, making the United States lose first place in the space race.
