, among other things. So they'd share the same niche as a cat.
In fact it is also a bird of prey.  The blue jays in Toronto and Ottawa eat so many bugs. I've had one walk on me so many times it would have scared most birds (my mother's blue jay is my favourite) but my blue jay lets him get the little bit of flesh left alive when I was in the garden cleaning her area up.
Not all Blue Jays are predatory. I have a Blue Jay who likes to perch right next to me on the stoop. It's nice to be able to pet it if I so choose to.

What species of bird is the most popular bird? I've seen birds in various locales like Canada being the most abundant; I was told by a biologist that Canada vultures are just as popular but I've heard birds who live in other continents or who migrate are more popular.

Vultures seem cool. I saw a Great Bustard during the migration, a bit scary though, looking straight into the camera lens. Didn't think they could see so little, but hey, that just means I didn't see them with my eyes!
