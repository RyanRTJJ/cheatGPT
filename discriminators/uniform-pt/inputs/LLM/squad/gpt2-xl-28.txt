It was only through the diffusion the various cultures on the continent that the first civilizations and nations of Western Europe would emerge. Their origins lie in the early development of agriculture. In the 6th millennium BC the first agricultural settlements began to emerge in Europe, particularly in modern-day Romania and western Ukraine. In eastern Europe, as far south as southern Serbia, the first large-scale urban centers developed in the 7th century BC. It was not until the 15th century that the first towns and settlements appeared in Central Europe.

The development of city-states in Central Europe was a major factor in the decline of the Eastern Roman Empire, culminating in collapse at the hands of the Muslim conquests in the 7th century.

While the first civilizations may have arisen before the arrival of writing, the written record indicates that the earliest written form of communication, the hieroglyph, did not develop until several centuries later, circa 150 BC. Written representations only appear in Europe at this time, in Gaul (Celts), Germanic and Celtic territory. The earliest examples appear between 200 and 150 BC in Asia Minor. By 300 BC the classical Greek language, while not yet fully developed, was evident on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, within Italy, as well as in the southernmost extent of the British Isles. The first example of Latin is believed to have appeared in what is now Belgium.

When the Greeks and Romans founded the earliest of their cities on the coast of Italy (and in other parts of the known world) in the Mediterranean region, they developed from small settlements into a significant coastal center that extended from the central Peloponnese, around the
