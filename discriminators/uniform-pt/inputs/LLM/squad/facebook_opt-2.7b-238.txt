 true empirically, but only if taken metaphorically; we no longer knew how to put physical facts into their rightful places in a rational cosmos. It now seemed that there was simply no place for physical reality.

The philosophical revolution of the early twentieth century was in its turn preceded by the rise of anti-realism. This set the stage for an even more radical move. In the second half of the nineteenth century, realists used the fact that what we knew for certain about the material world could be tested for, and proved to be true or false, for the construction of mathematical systems that could make accurate predictions of physical phenomena. But when people started talking about what was true about nature as a whole, realists (such as David Hume or John Stuart Mill) and anti-realists (the realists in particular) both fell silent. If this silence is interpreted as meaning that all that human knowledge could do was to give a better mathematical framework for describing what we already knew, then it is surprising that so many people took such matters so seriously. But, as is sometimes the case, it is not surprising to find that people were just too busy looking for something.

Modern materialism became self-fulfilling: in the 1970s, it finally became obvious that physical truths could not be known for certain on any level, even at the level of the atom, which itself was already a myth. And so, after thirty years
