 generally only a subset (or a handful) of the people who were already in the areas that would later become (parts of) Western Europe. This section attempts to explain some of the social and cultural developments during this period

Before the rise of Rome, the early Iron Age saw a gradual increase in complexity and social differentiation in the west. The central problem in this social evolution was one of land tenure: who is allowed to take for himself the land that the community has invested time, energy and labour (and, more generally, whose labour can be taken) in working? In the case of Celtic tribes such as the Veneti of the North Sea these would have been areas of upland open to common grazing, where they relied on herding, fishing and seasonal harvesting of trees and mushrooms (as seen in modern Scotland).

This problem, which was in no way specific to these areas and other early Iron Age societies, continued into the Roman Empire when "the great men of the past, not unlike the great men in later Rome, were men of birth and achievement, who had little to do with local land tenancy and with none of the local economic and social bonds that tied village to villa." However, the Roman Empire did give Western Europe a form of Roman law - a set of rights which could be asserted and protected by individuals, through the legal system. This system was based on the Latin language, a language already spoken around the Mediterranean
