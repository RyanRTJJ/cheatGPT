This was based principally on the efforts of the so-called Leipzig circle. While Germany became the economic and political leader of Europe, the scientific output of the country lagged some way behind: mathematics and natural sciences were particularly strong.

In the first half of the 20th century, the development of Germany's universities and of a modern scientific culture in Germany was in many ways led by a few outstanding personalities and institutions. The University of Berlin was the leading university of
