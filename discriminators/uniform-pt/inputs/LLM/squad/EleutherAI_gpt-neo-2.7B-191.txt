 Experiment) might be seen as the first recorded college group singing in public. The group was founded in the fall of 1855 by ten undergraduate students who would come to be collectively known as The Rensselaers, for their alma mater, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. They believed that the students were uniquely competent to teach the public how to sing and were able to do so using an experimental approach to a cappella. Some students, however, were skeptical about any results that came from the group. Many wanted to find more effective ways to communicate with the public, and in an effort to do that, they chose to start a college newspaper that they named The Collegian.

The Collegian had a circulation of around 200. At first it was considered a poor newspaper, but the content soon began to grow and eventually the paper became wildly popular, especially with its first student. The Collegian's popularity caused a few students to leave the experiment. One of these students, Thomas Cushing, a student at Yale, later coined the term a cappella for the group he was in, and it was in this process that the idea of college a cappella as a subgenre began. The first recorded example of the modern day practice of a cappella appears in The Yale Review of Literature and Art from September 19, 1859, where a group named College A Cappella from the School of Music, Yale University, composed a song called "The First Noel." The Yale Review article goes on to say that "the singers, all of whom have taken, as a special grace, singing lessons in the first song, have been inveting each other in song on this new and attractive subject." As time went on, this early experimental group would be joined by many others, including other schools
