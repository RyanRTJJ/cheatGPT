 as well as the potential for a rethinking of the official HDI definitions. They discuss how a more sophisticated health care measurement framework could be used to enhance the quality of the data relative to the current GDP measure, and conclude by summarizing the evidence that the GDP has a significant error bar in health, education and income data.


Hendrik Wolff, Howard Chong, Maximilian Auffhammer and Huo-Min Chai discuss the main findings from the recent World Bank annual report on the HDI, which shows a positive correlation between HDI and per-capita income, the number of years of schooling, gross domestic purchasing power parity (GDP) and a range of development indicators.


Howard Chong and Hendrik Wolff, senior economists at the World Bank, review the recent study by the International Monetary Fund that discusses a range of important issues including the performance of the GDP and the HDI, as well as the current economic outlook. They conclude by discussing some of the issues being actively examined both in their own work and by other investigators.
