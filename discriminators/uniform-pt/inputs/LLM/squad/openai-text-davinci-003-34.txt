of secret germ warfare tests on the public." The experiments, which included releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swaths of the population, occurred mainly in the area surrounding the British Isles.

The tests were part of the government's biological weapons research programme, known as "Operation Cauldron," and involved researchers from the Porton Down military laboratory. While the majority of tests were carried out over the British Isles, some were conducted as far away as the Mediterranean, Scandinavia, and the Arctic.

The experiments, reportedly aimed at helping the government defend against possible future attacks with chemical or biological weapons, could have had a much more serious public health impact than previously thought. For example, some of the materials released during the experiments included spores of a bacterium which can cause Legionnaires' disease, and also a potentially hazardous fungus. However, the government has consistently denied any testing of potentially harmful materials on the public, suggesting that only relatively harmless particles were released during its experiments.

The report generated a huge amount of criticism and concern, causing the government to launch an inquiry into the testing and to call for tighter controls on biological weapons research. It remains to be seen what long-term effects, if any, these experiments have had on the general public.
