 the heavily-fortified feudal barons. This was mainly due to the barons' control over their castles and fortifications, and their refusal to accept the King's authority. In order to assert his power, the King had to seek outside help, in the form of military forces, to impose his will on the nobility. However, this was not always a successful strategy, and often led to opposition, revolt, and civil war.

At times, the need for a strong leader was so great that the King was able to successfully expand his holdings. This was particularly the case during the reigns of Philip IV and Charles IV, when the crown confiscated the lands of rebellious barons and increased their own influence over the nobility. On other occasions, the barons successfully defended their rights and maintained their independence. When this happened, civil conflicts often erupted, resulting in the rulers being forced to sign damaging treaties, and ultimately ceding power to the nobility.

In general, the expansion of the French monarch's influence in the 14th century was largely unsuccessful, due to the resistance of the fortified nobles and the inability of the King to use military force as a viable strategy.
