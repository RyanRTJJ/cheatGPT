 ruling oligarchy was ethnically mixed. Although they may have had limited Greek-language learning, there is evidence of bilingualism in the literature of the period. The first Greek king who adopted the title “tyrant” in Macedonian was Aristagoras, who lived a great deal in the Seleucid city of Alexandria.

Bilingualism of the Greeks under the Seleucid Empire

There were two Greek kingdoms to the south of the Persian Empire, one in Macedonia and the other in the Aegean. The Seleucid Empire was founded as a Macedonian client state which became a major Hellenistic power. Its Greek-speaking population was generally culturally and linguistically Greek but, according to some historians, they were not ethnically all that Greek. They referred to themselves as Hellenes who were Greeks in name only (Schedos) and to their political community as the Hellene people (Chrepteres). Some of the Hellenes from the Macedonian Empire who converted to Greek religion were Hellenized later by the Seleucid Greeks, while others retained their ethnocultural heritage. Those who converted took Greek names, the names of some of which appear in the historical record. The Hellene people of the Seleucid Empire (Chrepteres) used the Greek language as the language of their rulers, public officials and commoners in some ways. However, they did not use it as the language of administration. As an example, the Seleucid archives tell us how the king of Pherae wrote his own name, rather than that of the Seleucid ruler, in the form of a royal name. They used a language of the Greek language for their own correspondence, not the Greek language as we understand it today. It seems that they used Greek for the purpose of foreign policy.
