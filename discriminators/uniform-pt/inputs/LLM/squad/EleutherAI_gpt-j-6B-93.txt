. This study suggested that all five of Oetzi's mtDNA lineages dated back to “a single common ancestor that lived in the Central and Eastern Ukraine and southern Belarus” in the period 10–14 AD. It identified this common ancestor to be Y0107, a paternal haplogroup that “is found today in populations of Eastern, Central and Western South Asia.” Richards' results conflicted with those of the study cited above, but they also conflicted (albeit to a lesser degree) with another 2011 study published in the same British Journal of Haematology report, a 2013 paper on DNA analysis of Oetzi's teeth that found Oetzi was not a direct ancestor of the Ami, the Turkic speaking people of Transcaucasia.

In 2019, a different team in Germany, led by researchers at Hamburg's Institute for Social Research and the National Institutes of Natural Science in Beijing, published a study in PLOS One of mtDNA in Oetzi's body, reaching a different conclusion regarding Y0107 than Richards and the team that analyzed his teeth. The authors identified Y0107 as "a haplogroup shared by people from the south of Transcaucasia" and concluded that Y0107 dates from around 3,800 years ago, around the same time period as that of the common ancestor of the Ami, the Turkic-speakers that the other team cited from the 2013 study published in the British Journal of Haematology. The team did not identify Oetzi as an ancestor of the Ami, the Turkic-speakers, but rather identified him as a distant, but genetically distinct ancestor of the Scythians, who lived between the 2nd and
