 class were dominated by an oligarchy within a larger aristocracy, dominated in turn by a royal family, but only loosely connected to the Seleucids. The Macedonian kings themselves largely did not see the local Greek cities as extensions of their realm or their authority. Their goal was generally rather to co-opt the Macedonian government and local elites.

The Roman province of Syria had Greek cities, such as Antioch (Syria), Emesa (Homs) and Apamea (Caesarea), that could more or less function in this way, but had not been ruled by the Seleucids (and to a lesser degree the Ptolemys), whereas Cyrene (in modern Libya, Egypt) and all the Phoenician cities were under the administration of the local Cypriot rulers, the Ptolemies. Thus the Seleucid Empire had effectively been ruled for a very long time by a Greek population whose ancestors had never been under the rule of the Seleucids.

At the moment of the founding of the Empire, the Seleucids had been the ruling power in only one city: Antioch on the Orontes, Syria's largest and most important city (though they later lost its status). The Seleucids had not been in power since the 3rd century at the latest, and all the cities of the empire had come under the rule of non-Seleucid rulers between then and the foundation of the Empire. These rulers had not been especially friendly to the Seleucids.

They could rule over local officials but not local elites, but it was clear that they did not trust most of the local officials. They did not trust the Greeks of Antioch, who had overthrown them; the local
