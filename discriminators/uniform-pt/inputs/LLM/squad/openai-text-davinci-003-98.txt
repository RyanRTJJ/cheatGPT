 self-esteem see it as playing a central role in forming, maintaining, and adapting identity. The way that a person views and values themselves can have a major impact on how they identify and engage with the world around them. Self-esteem is usually shaped by a mixture of environmental, social, and personal factors, such as family relationships, achievements, and feelings of worthiness. Self-esteem has been linked to psychological outcomes, such as mental health and well-being, as well as physical and social behaviors. Having a positive self-esteem can lead to greater confidence and self-determination and can help to create a sense of self-worth and belonging. People with low self-esteem may struggle to achieve their goals, feel disconnected from others, and may struggle to become the person they want to be. Therefore, developing healthy self-esteem is an important part of identity formation.
