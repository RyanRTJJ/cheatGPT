 United Monarchy, the area was ruled by a number of other monarchies, until Josiah's restoration of Judah, and Solomon's rule in Israel. Judah was conquered for about 500 years by the Philistines and became a client state of the Empire of Ashoka (e.g. the Greek Seleucids, Parthians, and Sassanid Persians). Assyria was dominant at this time and was an empire with territorial power. But when Nebuchadnezzar conquered Judah in 605 BCE, he also annexed Israel to Assyria, establishing the Kingdom of Israel. The Israelites continued to rule themselves as a tributary state of Assyria. The Israelite state in this period was established on tribal independence, but was not a monarchy. It was conquered by the Babylonians in 587 BCE after the siege of Jerusalem, and the Babylonian monarch Nebuchadnezzar ordered the execution of all males over 20 in Judah.[citation needed] After Judah and Benjamin were captured during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem in 587 BCE, a new nation was established in the area of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh and called the Kingdom of Ephraim.[citation needed] It was under the suzerainty of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, but retained cultural and religious ties to the former kingdom of Israel, under Babylonian dynasties. The Israelite state under this ruling house changed its name to the Hasmonean Kingdom in 167 BCE under the reign of the HasmoneanHasmonean dynasty of kings, who were from the Jehoiachin branch of the Davidic House of Judah. This is the state with which Jews believe their nation began.
