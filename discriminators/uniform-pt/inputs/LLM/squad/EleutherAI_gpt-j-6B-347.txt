 the human body can "adapt" quickly to a deficit of water, and then compensate by drawing water from the cells through osmosis, has been widely contradicted over the decades. Current nutritional guidelines for optimal hydration suggest that we should all drink at least 2–3 glasses of water each day. This recommendation is to be made even more strictly for athletic training and competitive endeavors where high caloric intake can result in weight gain and dehydration where one loses excess water, resulting in decreased athletic performance.

Another important but misunderstood aspect of the regulation of water intake is that, aside from the loss of water through perspiration, the actual quantity lost is not the limiting factor as the body can easily maintain equilibrium by drawing in approximately 300–400 ml of water per day via the ingestion of water-rich foods.  This means that those with the highest water needs, such as active individuals who sweat heavily and athletes, will only drink in excess of the amount they lose in perspiration.

Many people consume more than double the "recommended" amount of food. Overconsumption of food often results from the mistaken assumption that food is an unlimited resource. Because water occupies virtually all of the weight of living things, it is a limiting nutrient. Food and water simply can not replace each other in the body, and when the individual body tries to use energy to keep a certain amount of fluids in the cells without any energy entering the cells, the result is a negative net effect. This means that individuals can not get all of the energy into cells that they normally would with food alone. It has been reported that athletes, who are generally active
