 excess, dietary FAs have other negative effects on human health, including their potential to generate FAs with more harmful characteristics than essential FAs, such as increased susceptibility to metabolic diseases from long-term intake and increased exposure and risk of heart disease at any level.^[@R13]^

Since the mid-1980s fatty acid requirements have been defined in terms of specific dietary fatty acids; eicosanoids being a key consideration of fatty acid quality.^[@R37]^ In the United States, the Institute of Medicine proposed the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for FAs in 2001 for men and women as follows:^[@R1]^ 18 to 22% for saturated fatty acids, including the 20:5n-3 essential fatty acid in fish; 9 to 17% for monounsaturated fatty acids, including MUFA; and 6 to 11% for polyunsaturated fatty acids, including the n-3:n-6 essential FAs PUFA, for which sources are vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and their products (e.g., soya beans) in a food group called "mixed fatty acids." In 2004, when the National Academy of Medicine\'s report on recommendations for essential fatty acids was published, including the recommendation for omega-3 PUFA intake,^[@R4]^ the recommended diet for men and women was almost identical.^[@R12]^ Thus, the recommended diet of the USA is that recommended from the 2000 United States Advisory Panel on Diet, Physical Activity, and Health. By the age of 65 years, this should provide about 21% of energy from FAs and 9% from MUFAs and PUFAs as follows:^[@R7]^ 11%--15% for total PUFAs,
