 of child welfare in America, and has provided funding for dozens of studies that have revealed many of the most troubling aspects of child malnutrition in affluent countries. Many recent studies point to the following facts:

1. In these wealthy countries, children in primary care suffer from severe nutritional problems or malnutrition, including stunted growth, decreased immune functions, increased body-mass index, and poor eating habits.

2. Children in this country suffer from conditions such as low calcium intake, inadequate vitamin D intake, and inadequate iodine intake that affect their intellectual development and behavior.

3. Many of these conditions can be alleviated through diet and exercise, not just by government intervention. In wealthy countries, nearly all children's diets provide vitamin D (400 to 600 IU per day, from fish, eggs, chicken breast, bananas, strawberries) and adequate iodine (30 to 50 milligrams per day per child) by eating food fortified with calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, and iron. And in wealthy countries, the average adult consumes over 700 mg of calcium, nearly five times the amount Americans typically consume during their childhood.

4. The rich tend to eat more protein, sugar, and red meat than almost any other industrialized country. This fact is even more alarming than the fact that so many of these rich people live near one another. In the USA alone, more than 90 percent of Americans live more than 50 miles from one another.

5. In all countries, over a third of children under 15 die before reaching a critical chronological age, the prime
