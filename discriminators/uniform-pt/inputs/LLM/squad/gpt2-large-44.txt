 have a larger volume of blood, and are much more efficient at exchanging oxygen into blood.

This means that birds can use air to breath and absorb oxygen and CO 2. This greatly improves their metabolism, so when they die they typically do not have to stop breathing until all their blood has stopped circulating.

Birds have a small surface area to fluid exchange volume, so they can only use blood to breathe. Because birds do not have to stop breathing and are unable to exhale through their mouth during respiration, they can use air as an alternative to drinking water.

However, it is important to remember that birds must remain as far away from humans as possible, which means that they have to do their breathing while perched on the side of trees, on birds of prey, or through a blind.

They will therefore only breathe when it is absolutely necessary for them to breathe.

However, when breathing air, there is a limit to how many times they can inhale through their mouth before it is necessary. There is still a relatively small volume of air that can pass though the mouth before it is necessary to breathe again, but when air is used most of the air that has been exhaled through the mouth is exhausted.

They always start the process that they know is necessary by gulping their first breath through their nose, and then go on to inhale through their mouth when they are ready.

For example, a common occurrence for adult eagles is to start their breath before they are
