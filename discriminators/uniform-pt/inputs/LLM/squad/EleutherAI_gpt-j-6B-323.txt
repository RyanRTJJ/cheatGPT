 highlights of all the games but no live football. The Premier League on Channel 4 in the 1990s often started an hour after the scheduled time and the FA Cup Final was postponed from its usual 4pm kick-off time to around midnight on days when big matches clashed.

In 1972 the FA started a system for promoting teams into higher divisions. The top division was the Football League First Division (replacing the original Division One) and this was split into two new Division Leagues, the First and the Second. The top 18 teams from the First Division qualified for the new division.

The First Division (or Division One) had no top clubs (in fact, only the top 13 had automatic entry into the competition; in 1972/73 all teams in the First Division had a place in the competition), with the 18th team being placed in the new Northern Division one.

By 1973, only 14 First Division clubs had been relegated down to the third tier of domestic league football the previous season.

The Third Division was introduced in 1974, being introduced from Level Four of non-league football. At the end of the first season, it was replaced by the new Fourth Division (the so-called "fourth level") which had no automatic top teams, with the champions and runners-up of this new division also qualifying for the second tier competition.

A system of Promotion and Relegation was introduced for the 1974/75 season. This saw clubs who were relegated from the FA Premier League the previous season, replaced by those with the most points from lower tier teams who had finished above those clubs in the league.
