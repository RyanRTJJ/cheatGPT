ers (Norman Wittenberg, 1977).

One possible implication for the shift to the left is that, when a "new character" is inserted in either the alphabet or the "alphabet" of words, at least some of them now resemble a human, by means of the shift from one alphabet to another. Such shifts suggest that the word character does not appear directly in alphabet letters, but rather is shifted through adjacent letters or by the shift of the word letters. For example, in the first sentence of the sentence "The person with a beard," the word "the beard," is inserted into an adjacent letter with the same shift as in the first sentence. The sentence "A child with red hair" is inserted in a single word with the same shift as in the first sentence of the sentence "Tiger," and the word "Chewy puppy," with the same shift as the first sentence.

One possible explanation to account for this discrepancy in the case of the shift in the initial letter of a word character is that, when the shift of a digit occurs, the shift is not immediately followed by any other character or character structure. For example, while a shift of the shift key indicates the presence of the digit in "J," the shift of the shift key indicates the existence of a separate character "G." This shift may be used to indicate that a digit is not necessarily in alphabet letters; for instance, for "Chewy puppy," the shift of the shift key indicates the presence of a different character or character structure for the last letter. As such, the shift key may not be always followed
