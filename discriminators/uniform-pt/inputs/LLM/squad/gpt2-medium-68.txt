 from Cologne to the industrial east. Through the motorway system between Hesse and Hannover the route was widened significantly by widening the A4 and A4A to the present extent. The new line, the A5, was created before the introduction of direct service (but not before the arrival of the A4 and A4A) but in order to have sufficient space for the existing motorways and access to the cities (especially Cologne) the old route was converted into an elevated expressway during World War II with no change in service.

After World War II, the motorway system between Hesse and Hannover underwent a drastic decline, from the A4, which continued to serve from 1931 as the A4 motorway, to the A4H (which in the mid-1960s was transformed to the A4, A4SE as the A4C motorway and then the A5 from 1962 onwards), until it was closed when the road system became too unsafe in 1977. While there was one exception, in January 2018 Hesse has begun to build the A5, a four-mile motorway (under way for several years) on the eastern edge of town, as a replacement for the A4A. Hesse also intends to extend the A5 from the town centre via the north of the city â€“ and possibly through the Hesse-Wittenberg area.

Cologne Edit

Sightseeing the city along the A1 and A3 motorways brings one to the centre of central Cologne. It is located close to the world-famous Humboldt cathedral which in turn offers visitors a direct view of St Pauli and the city centre.

The A1 and A3 motorways provide direct service in central Cologne and
