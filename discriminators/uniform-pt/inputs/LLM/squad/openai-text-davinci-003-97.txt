h the continent and beyond, and the possibility of an invasion by the German army, the perilous situation of Britain in the summer of 1940 is obvious.

The Battle of Britain in July and August of 1940 was an example of just how much damage the Luftwaffe could inflict. The German air force conducted a sustained bombing campaign against British airfields, factories, and cities. The attacks caused extensive damage to British cities and caused more than 43,000 civilian casualties and losses of material, which hampered British war production. In addition, the German air force was able to shoot down many fighter planes of the Royal Air Force, forcing the British to restrict their operations to night bombing raids.

The German air force also conducted several other operations during the war, such as the Blitz of 1941 and 1942, where it attacked cities such as London, Liverpool and other major British ports and cities. In addition, the Luftwaffe conducted operations during the Battle of the Atlantic, attacking Allied shipping carrying supplies to Britain.

Ultimately, though Britain was able to withstand the onslaught of the Luftwaffe, the damage inflicted by it was immense. The destruction both material and in life that it caused had a significant impact on British morale and the capacity of the Royal Air Force to continue the fight. Ultimately, the sustained bombing campaign of the Luftwaffe, combined with the possibility of invasion, forced Britain to seek a negotiated peace with Germany.
