 all domains, including encoding and storage. They are not a fixed, single-pass operation; rather they are multi-pass systems that operate at different time scales (e.g., seconds to minutes) and different levels of abstraction. These processes affect the encoding of various aspects of the memory trace as represented by the brain circuit (Schnelle & Dagher, 2009). These components are thought to be driven by different mechanisms, depending on how long-term, short-term, or episodic memory is being accessed.

A key property of the mechanisms that underlie memory encoding is that they involve short-term vs. long-term consolidation or maintenance processes (Bartlett, 1999; Jancke & Bartlett, 2005). Both short-term and long-term memory are represented by neural circuits that integrate both the input (e.g., information retrieved from the environment during the past) and the output (e.g., memories and behavioral outputs that are acquired during the past) information and, in a first stage, combine them in a structured form to produce a memory trace. It is later during this process of consolidation, between 24% and 96% of information is retained, depending on the type of memory (Bodil et al., 2004; Bartlett, 2001; Filipponi, 1991; Bartlett, 1991; Dagher et al., 2013). Recent evidence suggests that this consolidation may occur not only in short-term memory, but also in long-term memory (see, e.g., Dagher et al., 2013; Groopman, 2006; Grady et al., 1999; Mokrysz, 2002; Nyffeler et al., 2012; Schulze et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2006; Visser et al., 2011).
