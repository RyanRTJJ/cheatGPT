 Empire collapsed from various internal conflicts, the traditional Ottoman Medr√¢se tradition was disrupted because the new secularist authorities wanted to change this form of worship."

In other words, it's bullshit.

Also, they're wrong about all kinds of basic stuff. They think a large part of the Ottoman Empire didn't have a Muslim majority (it did). They think the Muslims who remained in Constantinople weren't mostly Sunnis, because the Ottomans in Istanbul during the middle ages often had mixed marriages (which meant a hell of a lot more children than the average Muslim today).

"In response to the threat of the Seljuk Turks, they founded the new city in 1331. According to the new name 'Constantinople', the name was supposed to be a place that held the past glory of the former Ottoman Empire as well as the Ottoman empire of the future."[3]

So, in the past they built a new city in 1331, which they named after Constantinople, the capital of the former empire. Now their capital has been moved to Ankara, and there isn't even a city there called after the old city.

The city of Ankara, however, *is* named after the old city as I understand, so I don't get the point of adding that name here.

"In the end, the new medrese was made up of both Muslims and Christians. All the Muslim people who lived in these areas were called Ottoman Muslim and all the Christian people were called Ottoman Christians."

"The medreses were an important part of traditional Sufi Islam and the Islamic spiritual tradition. The medreses were the places of'revelation,' where the Sufi orders could give their followers guidance."[4]

Except that it turns out it's bullshit.

There's some stuff in there, but the basic thing is they were places where the Sufi orders were recognized (and thus considered) to be of special merit. Which they were. There's some stuff about how
