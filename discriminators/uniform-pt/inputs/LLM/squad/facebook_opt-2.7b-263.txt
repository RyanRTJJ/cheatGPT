 17 people were killed in New York City by cable-borne elevators; in contrast, there were no cable-borne elevator-related fatalities in the United States in 1990 or 2001," said NYC Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.

"We are happy to work with the Federal Communications Commission to implement this rule, which will help to protect the safety of New Yorkers and their guests. I also want to thank the entire City Council for its support in bringing this issue before the City Council," the mayor added.

The City Council adopted the resolution today and is expected to vote on the resolution, H-7, Thursday.

With the passage of H-7, the City Council has acted to protect New Yorkers from this potentially deadly form of transportation.

The mayor's office notes that in 1997, the New York State Division of Occupational Safety and Health, found cable-borne elevators to be the safest way to travel during a fire evacuation. In addition, the division found that cable-borne elevators had few mechanical safety problems.
