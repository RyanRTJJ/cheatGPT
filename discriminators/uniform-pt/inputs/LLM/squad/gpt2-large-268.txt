 of limitations than universities themselves. For example, under British law a polytechnic had to close within five years of its initial establishment unless the institution was closed for good. Similarly, under French law, it had to be closed within ten years of its establishment.

In contrast, within the USA, there was a strong and ongoing relationship between universities and polytechnics and therefore, within one of the oldest societies of higher education in the world, it makes perfect sense to assume that this relationship remains valid. As an example, on 11 October 1778, three universities were ordered by Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Jefferson to close. With the exception of University of New York, two of them closed before or very near their twenty-fifth anniversary, and the last one closed on 1 October 1900. Today, the last American school of law (in Boston) closed on 21 September 2006. Given that all three of these institutions have now closed, it is indeed logical to suppose that they remain as closed institutions today as they were in 1778. However, it would be erroneous to imagine that all three closed institutions are the same today, since a majority of them have moved forward. For this reason, it is more accurate (and perhaps more informative) to estimate the numbers of polytechnics and institutes of technology in the USA and to compare them to those in other countries.

A recent study, conducted based on surveys of Polytechnic Associations in the USA conducted in 2004, has shown that, since 2004, the number of polytechnic students in the US has risen from 2,200 in the early 1990s to 5,800 in 2011. It is important to note that all three polytechnics that were once closed have since re-opened and have many more students – an estimated 14,500 to 16,000 – than in 2004. The number of polytechnics and institutes of technology in the USA rose from less than 300 in 1998, to over 10,000 in 2012. Thus, it is not too much of a stretch to assume that these numbers will continue to rise, and probably continue to rise in the near future. Given that there was
