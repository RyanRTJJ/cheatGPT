 taekwondo gold medalist, Jenny Huang.

"The torch passed our taekwondo team on the way, and then we lit it," said Huang, speaking to an NBC crew at the site of the ceremony. "And we brought it to you."

As night fell, more than 60,000 people filled out the bleacher stands, filling San Francisco's waterfront with a cacophony of chants, music and fireworks, a testament to both sport and country.

The crowd was not disappointed. They waved American flags, cheered on their favorite athletes, and watched two weeks of preparation culminate in one of America's most cherished symbols.

As the ceremony began, the American taekwondo team introduced themselves and the national anthem. They received a standing ovation and were overwhelmed by emotions.

Their performance was just over two weeks in the making. The team practiced for months, with members traveling from California, Arizona, Texas, and more.

Dramatic footage of the night was captured on cell phones, in stills and video. Some Americans were so moved they cried.

Sometime during the performance, the Olympic torch was moved from right to left, over the Bay and through the streets of San Francisco, a show of strength and power. It traveled the full length of the park, stopping several blocks away at AT&T field.

The taekwondo team, the gymnastics team and other athletes had just emerged from a tunnel, into the sun, where they faced their first big challenge. They are required not only to run, but also run fast, and for a full 15,000 meters, without holding onto the flaming torch.

The torch was lit at 20:04 pm PDT, with taekwondo competitor, Rui Costa, holding it aloft.

"To become an Olympic gold medalist, we must work very very hard. But to have this opportunity tonight is something very special,"
