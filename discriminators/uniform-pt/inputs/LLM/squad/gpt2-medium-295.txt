 August 2, just seven days after he had reached orbit, Boba Fett, a member of the rebel Alliance of Free Planets, became the first human in space.

During our visit, I was asked if this was the first time I had ever seen a human walk on Earth. My reaction was to laugh out loud and smile. Yet, this was not a typical reaction for me given the nature of space and where we now are in history in many respects. When I grew up, I had always felt that space was a fantasy world and that I would never see any kind of human ever walk on the Earth; but today with the technology and resources at our disposal to help us bring people to the ground, we can still do so with confidence. At this time there is certainly another way â€“ we simply do not know how long it may take until our first human actually walked on the surface of the planet. Maybe in the next century? Or maybe not?

It is also possible that we will never see another walk on Earth.

The space race, and the space exploration industry, would have us believe that such progress will be accelerated in the decades to come. However, in my opinion that is unrealistic given the current situation in our planet. This current situation is due to human and technological degradation due to the constant environmental changes around us and our inability to sustain life for an extended period of time at the expense of the environment
