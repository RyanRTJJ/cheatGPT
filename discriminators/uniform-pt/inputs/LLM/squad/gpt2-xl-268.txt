 in place prior to independence and were also subject to the control of the respective governments of that respective country and were responsible for the control of their students.

A more recent (as of 2015) article on the topic of teaching at university level by the UNESCO World Heritage Centre has added to the confusion because it refers to a number of places throughout the world, primarily in the Asia-Pacific region, where the autonomy and autonomy of university colleges and universities has been curtailed.

The UNESCO article continues saying,

It is now common practice, in addition to the autonomy granted to university colleges and universities in their own countries, for all or many of these colleges to be administered by "independent" national governments. In a number of places, the autonomy of university colleges and universities has been curtailed; in some nations the autonomy of universities has been reduced. This has occurred primarily in Asia (primarily China, Vietnam and Japan) in association with rapid industrialization and urbanization. In some other places, such as the Philippines, it has been less the case since the country's rise to the world stage. However, this pattern of de- autonomous de-autonomy and increasing government control has led to major controversies.

The UNESCO writer continues discussing an argument made by a number of experts that states use the so-called "flexible" approach (i.e. university degrees are no longer issued to students until and if they are ready to be enrolled, despite lack of formal qualifications), which is not always successful and is "often seen to be a ploy to create a situation of dependency". As the article points out in the last sentence, the flexible approach has not been proved to be effective "in many places". For the last ten years, this article and many others have been making much ado about the autonomy and autonomy of polytechnics and institutes of technology in the region (many of them actually in my own university in Malaysia).

The latest edition of ISENP (Institution for Higher Mathematics and Science Programs) book (published in 2014 and available for online purchase here) states that this independence is not a recent phenomenon but
