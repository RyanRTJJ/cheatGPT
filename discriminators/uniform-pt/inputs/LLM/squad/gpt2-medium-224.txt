i also claims that the European university, because of its Muslim membership, adopted many of these aspects.

He said the European university's "reconciliation policy was not based on religious or social differences" and was designed to facilitate the establishment of a modern Islamic university.

The European university adopted its own definition of Sharia and incorporated several Sharia-compliant interpretations of Islam in its laws, Makdisi said.

The European Union is home to 15 Islamic universities, of which eight work outside the European Union, according to the Association of Muslim Faculty, which coordinates access to Islamic studies degrees in Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.

Makdisi claimed that many of the Islamic madrasas in Belgium, the Netherlands and the others receive funds from the European Union and that European member countries are willing to sponsor their conversion schools "to help them become effective Islam schools when they go to the universities that are willing to support conversion."

Belgium was given the responsibility in 2011 to establish the first Islamic university in the country, but since then it has only agreed with a select few madrasas to operate under its program because the other 14 Belgian associations have not been willing to take over the program, Makdisi said. He added that a few non-Islam schools, such as a madrassa in Paris and madrassa in Dijon, can operate under their own guidelines but not in Brussels.

There has so far been very little effort by Brussels to force the other non-Islam schools to open or to convert to Islam for conversion education, Makdisi noted. In July 2015, it was reported by Reuters that Belgium had decided to expand its conversion program for non-Islam schools, but this was only a "step,"
