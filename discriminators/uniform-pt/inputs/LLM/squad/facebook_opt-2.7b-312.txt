A lot of the attention focused on the "Blue Ivy Carter" in the videos playing on the drums.

Now, a year later, the videos have managed to raise over $1,735,000 (US). That's some pretty impressive crowdfunding success. Now, the campaign is officially coming over to the UK for fans to try to support it too.
