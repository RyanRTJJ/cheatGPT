 is no connection between the two inventions. The sound produced by a phonautograph was only ever an approximation of the voice and only the recording process, not the playback, worked as Edison expected. Sound recording in the modern sense of the term did not become a reality until about 100 years later.

At first it was a very primitive method of recording

The acoustic signal was usually recorded on a wax cylinder made out of beeswax, the grooves cutting the surface being made by a spiral groove or a raised edge. The cylinders were then played back on a turntable and a stylus was pressed onto the wax surface. The stylus would skip around the grooves as the turntable rotated and would only leave an impression when held still over the groove.

After several years of experiments, Edison finally succeeded in creating a viable phonautograph. An Edison phonautograph was made out of brass and consisted of a hollow tube in which a spiral groove was formed. A diaphragm at the end of the tube formed a tight seal and was held in place by a spiral spring, the whole tube being enclosed within a cylinder so that the ends of the tube protruded slightly. The tube was filled with alcohol which produced an almost perfect vacuum inside the tube. A small pin was inserted through the diaphragm and a tiny hole drilled in the cylinder and through the pin. As the cylinder was played a vibration in the air caused the
