 the acquisition period, consolidation, retrieval, and interference.

This paper describes each of the aforementioned phases in the cellular and molecular processes underlying memory formation and maintenance. We refer to these phases as the mechanisms of memory for the remainder of the paper. Specifically, memory may be thought of as the result of neuronal activation (or reactivation) during the consolidation and maintenance phase. For example, synaptic plasticity is a cellular process that enables the modification and strengthening of synaptic connections between neurons (for example, by synaptic scaling or induction of long‐term potentiation), which leads to the persistent strengthening of active pathways, enabling subsequent and future responses and, ultimately, to storage and retrieval of memories. In the sections below, we address in more detail these phases at the cellular and molecular levels, and this discussion will be completed by summarizing the most recent evidence on the roles played by different signaling pathways in each of these phases.

The acquisition phase of memory is a process by which a new memory is formed in an awake/moving subject (Buzsaki and Moskalev, 2010). This phase is characterized by neuronal growth and synaptic changes, and the formation of new neuronal and synaptic contacts between neurons. During this period, synapses are formed and strengthened in response to the stimuli that were repeatedly encountered and associated with the memory.

Synaptic plasticity, or modifications of synaptic connections between neurons, occur through two separate mechanisms: long‐term potentiation (LTP) and long‐term depression (LTD). LTP requires coincidentally
