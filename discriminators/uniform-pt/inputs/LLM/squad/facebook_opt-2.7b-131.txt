Although this understanding has been the norm in our society, some critics contend that the "biological" understanding of sexual development does not reflect the reality of non-binary sexuality. According to this view, "the body's natural process of sexual maturity begins in utero and continues into adolescence" through "various biological and cultural factors such as puberty, ovulation, childbirth, the end of breastfeeding, and age of puberty."
