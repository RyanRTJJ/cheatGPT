 Hidalgo founded his government in Veracruz, Mexico as a republic from December 28, 1822 until May 15, 1823, when the new Mexican Constitution was signed by the states of Mexico. Veracruz is one of only two Mexican states to be independent in that period. Hidalgo died in Mexico City on December 9, 1823.

During his short government, Hidalgo issued decrees against the priests and he sent the captured brigantines to the United States as part of the peace treaty with the Americans.

During the Battle of Goliad the Spanish commander, Colonel Juan Almonte, had a plan to capture Hidalgo and the other rebel leaders. He told his men to shoot all of the prisoners as they were in a house, in front of all the other houses and were in plain sight. When the soldiers entered the houses they executed all the occupants who were not rebels.

Hidalgo is considered one of The Three Heroes of the Independence War (Pablo Gomez Pedraza, Agustin de Iturbide and Hidalgo) because of the three separate actions that earned him the title "Father of the Nation" and his role in sparking and initiating the Mexican War of Independence.
