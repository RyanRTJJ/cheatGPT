. While Secure Boot appears to make it easier for devices to obtain the updates (via a mechanism called "Microsoft Update Assurance"), others argued that the policy was flawed and that Microsoft's goal for universal deployment was not to prevent attacks.

Microsoft responded by saying that it wanted devices to be able to receive updates — and with those updates being "non-volatile," an upgrade wouldn't require a reboot or any other configuration necessary to take effect.

And yet in some ways, this approach works well: with any kind of trusted storage such as USB sticks and SD cards, installing an update to a device can take a long time, depending on the hardware. And a device running Windows 8 can update itself without needing a reboot when needed — but a device running a legacy version of Windows will still need to be rebooted whenever needed.

On the negative side of boot update technology, it still has drawbacks: the update can only be applied when the device is connected, and it cannot be applied at any other time, such as from different places as your device and PC.

But these drawbacks have been largely mitigated by the new Windows 8. It adds a new feature called Continuum, which allows you to see your desktop screen on other types of computers while you are simultaneously using your
