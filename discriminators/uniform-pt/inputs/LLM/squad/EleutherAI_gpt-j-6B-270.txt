 72.2 m near Crowland. As a geological formation they are at the margins of the Archaean cratons, which contain much older (Proterozoic and Cambrian) rocks. The islands were originally formed by volcanic uplift; in Ireland most of the volcanism occurred in the past 10,000 years, the last of which being the most recent eruption of Skellig Michael, in southwest Ireland.

Formation

The northern and easterly islands, of volcanic origin, include some of the youngest in Ireland. Those near the Shetland Islands are very active volcanoes, forming basaltic lava flows and cinder cones that are relatively young compared to those of the older volcanic mountains on the Hebridean islands. The northernmost islands, north of Scotland, are older and the most frequently studied. Laxay, Luing, Soay and Stroma all date to the Eemian interglacial period, and are among the most volcanically active areas in the islands.

Skellig Michael is a young volcanic island (approximately 8,000 years old) and is Europe's newest island, having only been formed by a phreatic cinder cone in an earlier eruption. The youngest of these cinder cones are Skellig Michael. In 2011, Skellig Michael became the focus of a media story when it was reported that the island was showing slight signs of rising again in a process called phreatomagmatic activity and was thus on the verge of being re-made. It remained quiet until 2013. It has become very active again in recent years.
