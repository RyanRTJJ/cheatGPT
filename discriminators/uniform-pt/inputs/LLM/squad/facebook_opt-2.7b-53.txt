 government jobs, which they used to hire themselves out to Cantonese businesses. This practice, known by the Cantonese as "jin zi suan zhi", was abolished after the Manchu general Sima Qian became the Manchu leader of the Qing Empire.

In 1690, Hong Taiji submitted to Ming China a petition to be designated "Chief of the Canton Border", offering to pay a heavy tax. The Qing authorities said that such a designation would not be permitted under foreign law, but Hong Taiwanji insisted on it. Because Hong Taiji could not produce a single piece of evidence for his claim, the Ming authorities declared him "suspect" and prohibited his petition. The Han and European community found that all their Hong Taiji friends were disappearing, so Hong Taiji made a deal with the Ming authorities to use an old European spy to deliver documents to the Qing authorities. The spy managed to pass through Ming China once, but was captured again, forcing Hong Taiji to accept a third amnesty. He was finally able to leave China in 1694 through the newly created "Republic of China" in Beijing because the Manchu emperor refused to recognize the Republic. After arriving in Japan in late 1694, Hong Taiji was made "Deputy Chief Administrator" for the area where he was born: Shishiwajima, Nagasaki Province. He died in August 1696 of pneumonia in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.
