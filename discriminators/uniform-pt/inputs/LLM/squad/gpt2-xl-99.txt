These include an in-game history of the world as well as additional in-game menus (from where one can access a special menu of the game). The guide also has a section with the names of certain locations, which can be used to find out the names of keys that are needed to enter certain rooms and how to open doors without having to have a key, in order to save time. The instruction manual can also be used as a map or as a map by itself for exploration.

The second page of the instruction manual lists out two new features. The first is that the game automatically saves at regular intervals (as opposed to the previous Final Fantasy games), a feature introduced in the PC version of Dirge of Cerberus. This allows the user to use the game's pause menu to pause the game at any time. One should also be aware that the game does not save frequently, such as while in a dungeon or if one fights a boss.

The second new feature is the ability to customize the appearance of the game's characters and background. The user can edit the characters' appearance and even their names if they wish. Characters can also change their colors, hair
