 at the confluence of the St. Lawrence, Hudson and Ottawa rivers. The average winter temperature outside these three rivers is 5 °C (9 °F) lower than inside the St. Lawrence in Boston.

Boston is connected to the rest of the United States by several major waterways. The most important are the Hudson and Charles rivers. In most of Massachusetts, a four-lane tunnel known as the "Big Dig" is bisecting Route 6 and diverting traffic off the road and into Boston Harbor. The tunnel may have cut off water access for some people and created "dead zones" where fish cannot survive. Water supplies and sewage treatment facilities, including the sewer system itself, also suffer from a shortage of potable water and are unable to keep up with high levels of pollution. This is one reason why an estimated 3.3 billion gallons of sewage and 6.5 million tons of solid waste flow into the river each year. Boston residents don't have to worry about these water quality issues as much at present, but there will be plenty of space, energy, and money to make sure the city is up to full capacity in the future.

If you need to drive through Boston, the highways leading to and from town are narrow and congested. For those traveling from New York City, this means most or all of this route may be inaccessible. To get to Cambridge you might have some difficulty, but if you are going from the East Coast or from the South you will be in the suburbs. There are a number of good public transportation options throughout the city, including the Boston MRT.
