 abolition of the Trinity as soon as it occurred to them, and, at the time of Irenaeus, it was their favourite argument against Christianity. In the course of his work, the opponent of the Arian party, bishop Hippolytus of Rome, was engaged in an investigation of the writings of the apostle to the Gentiles, and of the epistle ascribed to the apostle Paul.

Irenaeus did not accuse any of them of heresy and he certainly did not believe that any of the apostles were not speaking the truth when he quoted Irenaeus' testimony".
