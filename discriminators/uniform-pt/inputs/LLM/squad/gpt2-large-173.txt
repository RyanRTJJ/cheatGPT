.). Cotton is produced in India under conditions of extreme dryness (low temperatures and short days), light pollution, poor air quality, and poor soil. It takes 5 to 6 years for a seedling to reach the market (Cotton Seed Company, India, 1973).

Although cotton seedlings do not grow during warm months, cotton in the form of plants, as in India, has developed a complex physiology, not unlike that of a tree. The young plants are tiny, but their energy system is geared more to grow, and will thrive by feeding on the dead leaves and debris of dead and dying plants. However, by the onset of autumn cotton's physiology becomes altered and the leaves are removed from the young trees. The leaves are reattached to the stem and the stem gradually breaks down, and the new cells which form the plant begin their life as new leaves.

As seen in figure 6 below, the plants begin to flower after a short interval, just as a tree has the ability to respond to various seasons, including winter. However, the flowering comes much later than we may be used to in the United States.

Figure 6. Flowering Cotton Plant (Megalophyllum canescens) During the second bloom of the plant, the flower bud is reached, which contains numerous white stamens.

Because of the plant's long time period of dormancy, the pollen released during the flower period is mostly non-nutritious and consists of water sugars which are in short supply during
