Darwin used the English word "fern" (Ferns) interchangeably with "green". (These translations were in error, and he later corrected the wording in the 1872 edition).

The second published mention of the idea is of Charles Darwin's mother (a contemporary woman) writing that "she had read all the books he had written" (John Hunter "The Mother's Tale" 1842, cited in [13.6]).

The third mentioned reference is the 1845 publication of the second edition of "On the Origin of Species", in which he states: "If, as I have often been led to infer from this sketch of the matter, the term "fern" does not refer only to common trees, it may certainly refer to any plant containing a very small trunk, the root and twigs of which are much smaller than the body."

Although Darwin believed himself to be "one of the earliest of all students of the theory of descent with modification", he was not the only one who believed that different species evolved when similar traits were present, not because each species had the same mutation. William Osborn [12] claimed that the word "fern" used to mean "common, or similar" and that it was this that "allowed for the formation of a variety of species when there was a combination of similar characteristics".

In 1837 Dr. W. B. MacMillan of Oxford used this belief to argue that the theory of natural selection was a "fool-proof theory" for the explanation of the origin of the human species: "In no species
