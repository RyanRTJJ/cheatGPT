ppella music became predominant in the second half of the 16th century. In 1720, Italian composer, Florence Bonnetini, created an allusion to this compositional tradition after reading one of those passages attributed to him. He then incorporated the idea of melodic harmony and a variety of traditional melodies into an orchestral sound to express his vision of an age of music, combining orchestral harmony with harmonic harmonic complexity. A cappella music remained in use throughout the early to mid 1900s, most notably in the music of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, whose orchestral opera "The Serenade" became an international sensation with a run of successful symphonies (Groupsen, "Nordic Fable" & "Volk und Fable"). The influence of a cappella music on classical and symphonic performance has been well documented.
