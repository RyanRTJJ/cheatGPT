's recent memory and a new No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with the same label's follow-up, No One Is To Blame. The album went on to win the 1987 GRAMMY Award for Album of the Year and the group finished the year with a No. 1 hit in their native UK with "(You Make Me) Feel Like A Natural Woman."

But Whitesnake were not about to settle for a modest rise to the top. Their next studio effort, 1991's Still Crazy Tonight, was a massive step up and sparked a new wave of interest in the band. The album went into the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart at No. 1, and as the first and only to do so, No One Is To Blame went on to win seven GRAMMY Awards -- Best Metal Performance, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group, Best Rock Album, Best Metal Performance, Album of the Year, Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, and Best Rock Song -- making Whitesnake the first and only act in history to receive seven Best Album of the Year GRAMMY Awards in a single year.

More than a decade later, Whitesnake embarked on the most successful tour of their career, performing in North America to sold-out arenas alongside Bon Jovi as well as the UK and Europe, winning every single award along the way. But the tour ultimately became something Whitesnake fans had all but given up on, as a reported "last-ditch" effort to boost sales was abandoned before going on tour and the band failed to secure radio airplay from any major stations.

Though their commercial fortunes had taken a downturn, Whitesnake's catalog also continued to take off, leading to a lucrative contract for the next decade, with their 1997 self-titled album generating just over $30 million to Whitesnake's $30 million.

The band went on to have a string of hits and multiple Grammy Awards, receiving nominations for "Pearly Shells" (which later won two Grammy Awards in a row for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance) and "Touch Me" with Madonna as well as for the 1999 album All Right Now and the 2000 album, No Surrender. And as if their work with such big names wasn't enough
