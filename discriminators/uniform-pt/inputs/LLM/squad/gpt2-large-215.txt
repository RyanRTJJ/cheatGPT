It is no longer sufficient to argue that it was inevitable that "the end of the world" would come if the world "repent[ed] of its sins" or "received the promises of God" (Acts 20:31). This is a mere preface to a much more significant conclusion about the present time.

"In every nation of the earth, Jehovah has been known by a single name, Jehovahâ€”the Lord Jehovah, Jehovah, Jehovah" declares the Witness pamphlet Jehovah's Witness in the 21st Century: The Great Tribulation to be the Day of the Lord (Jehovah's Witnesses International, 1998, p. 19). "On every continent," adds a later pamphlet, Jehovah Sees You (Jehovah's Witnesses International, 2000, p. 38), "God is the final and irrevocable decree." We are told that those "who follow Jehovah are being watched by a great hand of Providence" (Daniel 5:26, 27). The first of these "hands of Providence" is the Great Tribulation.
