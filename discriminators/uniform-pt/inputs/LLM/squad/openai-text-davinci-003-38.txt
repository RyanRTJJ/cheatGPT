rules of the Tsangpa dynasty. Karma Tseten had served as the administrator of the Rinbung principality, and originally had been sent by the king of the powerful neighbouring Kinnaur kingdom to act as the Rinbung Maharaja. His accession to the throne sparked a rebellion among the Rinbungs and ultimately led to the fall of the Rinbungs, and the beginning of the Tsangpa dynasty. Karma Tseten and his dynasty eventually became the rulers of western Tibet which included the regions of upper Mustang in Nepal and parts of Bhutan.

Karma Tseten was succeeded by descendents of the Rinbungs. This new ruling house adopted the title of Tsangpa and is known as the Tsangpa dynasty, ruling from 1565 to 1617. The Tsangpa rulers adopted a system of centralized rule and expansion and maintained international relations with neighboring states. They built a chain of fortresses and castles in their domains, which are today known as the Tibetan Forts, and it is in these castles that much of the Tibetan history has been preserved. During this period, the Tsangpa rulers ordered the construction of several gompas, or Buddhist monasteries, including the Mindrolling and Palyul lineages. These monasteries established the three major sects of Nyingma, Kagyu and Sakya in the area.
