Synopsis

The series begins with Matt and Megami meeting a mysterious man named Gai. The two are taken to his home in a futuristic city known as "Furet" (meaning "future") because of his strange abilities. Gai introduces Matt and Megami to his robot, Digimon Tamers, and tells them that Furet is the center of the DigiTiger Network; all of the digimon connected to this network belong to the Furet City. Gai's home in Furet is actually a time-space rift, and as a result, time and space in the city are twisted. To explain things, Gai starts off by telling them that all of the digimon have been given life-enhancing powers called "Digitisms" (or, "Digs," as they are usually called when they transform); the ultimate goal is to create a superbeing who is a fusion of all digi-types. It is mentioned that while Tamers are the most advanced digimon in the world, the Tamers from Furet make up only one percent of the world's digimon â€“ so the world's most advanced digimon are the Tamers' creations.

Matt and Megami watch a video where Gai states his aim for the Tamers: to give the world the power to connect with other species of digimon throughout the world. This is exactly what the Tamers are designed to do, since Matt and Megami are made of the same digi-type (an "Akemon," an archetypal Digimon). As Gai points out, though, every digimon in the world is connected by a special connection, and only they can be the ones who establish the connection to the other species. If the Digivolution of each Tamer fails, then the Tamers will never be able to accomplish this goal. Matt and Megami decide to use Matt's Digivice to see how digimon can be connected,
