 occurs throughout the animal kingdom and in humans among geographic groups, racial groups, and individuals. Hair color is often used as a visual means of phenotype identification. The color and patterns of hair reflect both direct and indirect genetic control. There are more than 25 known human genes for hair pigmentation, most with small phenotypic effect alone. However, the total effect of hair color determination is quite complex and remains to be elucidated. Hair color is thought to have a genetic basis, involving autosomal genes, x chromosomes, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).
Skin color has a genetic basis that is not as well understood than hair color because the range of variation in skin color is much greater than that of hair color. Human skin color varies genetically from pale grey to very dark brown (dark-skinned) to black (very dark-skinned) to dark reddish-brown to blond to light yellow (very light-skinned). Skin color is generally used as a visual means of phenotype identification.
There are many known human genes that affect skin color. Genes on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 17, 20, 21, and X and an estimated 60-80 other genes are associated with pigmentation, although only six are currently known in detail. HGF is the first pigment gene to be identified (Fonollosa, A. S. et al. (1995) EMBO J. 14:769-777); it is associated with dark skin pigmentation in Mexicans, African-Americans, and Indians, but not Caucasians (see FIG. 1, Panel B).
Other pigment loci are the Tyrp1 region on chromosome 1p between RPS14 and TNXB, the SLC45a2 region between ACO2 and ATP7B on chromosome 8p, and the MC1R region on chromosome 10q21 (Kratzer, P. C. et al. (1986) Science 232:1644-1646; Kratzer, P. C. et al. (1988)
