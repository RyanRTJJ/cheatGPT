 oldest airport in the world. Wright named the site in honor of College Park, Maryland, one of the first places to be settled by Americans, in 1814. Construction began in 1909. The airport was established by Wilbur Wright and his brother Orville. The college, which Wright helped to found, was named after his alma mater, Lehigh University.

Other flights have also been claimed to be the oldest in the world. The oldest such flight in the world is claimed by James Graham Bell's flight from Buffalo to Washington DC in June 1894. Bell attempted a flight in July that failed, but returned the following year. The first plane that landed on the moon on 20-21 December 1969 was flown from the United States, in this case an experimental Boeing 707, although it was not the first to do so. There is a theory that other early flights were never verified. There is also debate about the actual start of aviation.

The oldest aircraft type is the Junkers W28 (aircraft number W28 or W28A) aircraft (also known as the Junkers Jumo 37 or Junkers W28C). The first example was built in Germany in July, 1911, and flew on 21 August 1912.
