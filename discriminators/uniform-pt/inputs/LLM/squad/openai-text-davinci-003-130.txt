doctrinesâ€”the congregation elders will usually hold a series of private meetings with the individual to discuss the matter. If a reprimand is deemed necessary, the elders may impose a disciplinary action such as a public announcement or a temporary ban from the congregation.

In extreme cases, a person can be excommunicated from the church. This is the most severe form of discipline and is used sparingly. It seeks to suspend a person from the privileges of the church for a time, so that the guilty party may repent and be reconciled to the congregation. Excommunication is announced publicly after a period of private counsel with the elders. This can also be lifted if and when the person repents and makes a commitment to fulfill their obligations to the church.
