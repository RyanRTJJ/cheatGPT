 users, its fast performance, improved multitasking, and unified app store for both desktop and mobile devices was "impressive". Though he acknowledged its "gimmicky" side, he felt that the new features made some sense, particularly the same user interface experience on all devices. PC Mag's Jeffery L. Wilson found that the Start Screen was an effective replacement for the more traditional Start Menu, but felt that Microsoft didn't do enough to accommodate mouse and keyboard users. He also noted that the removal of the shutdown command was a hindrance and that an internet connection was required to take full advantage of the OS. CNET reviewer Angie Hansen was more effusive, praising the new user interface and its support for multi-monitor setups, as well as its speed, stability, and integration of Microsoft's online services.

Despite a few complaints, most reviewers found Windows 8 to offer a compelling experience. It has been praised for delivering a more unified experience across multiple devices, improved performance, and the inclusion of features like the Start Screen and integration with Microsoft's online services. However, the removal of the traditional desktop Start Menu and lack of support for mouse and keyboard users has been met with some criticism.
