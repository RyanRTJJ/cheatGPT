 in one of three ways: traditional brick building (sometimes referred to as a "traditional," "napkin," "frame," "fascell," "bungalow," "cottage," or "house/apartment house"), brick building with concrete facades, or brick building with steel-frame facades, with brick buildings with frame facades as the least common. Traditionally, students lived in these buildings all fall and winter semester. In the 1970s, all residence hall residents were issued electric heaters, rather than incandescent and fluorescent light bulbs.  After the renovation and modernization of residence halls in the 1940s, only two classes in a term studied in the buildings they lived in, the general education (g/e) class, and the social sciences (s/s) class. For the last 25 years or so of residence life, residential students have lived in the buildings they are assigned to live in, at least for at least two-thirds of each week during the fall and spring semester, with some exceptions. Today, the majority of students do most of their work on campus, live in the Residence Hall housing that surrounds or in buildings that surround it, and in some cases commute from neighborhoods away from campus.

Today a large construction and maintenance budget is spent on the campus buildings and structures, most of which were built before 1960 and will soon reach the end of their original service life, at least 50 years. Many of the older buildings have structural and mechanical problems that necessitate more frequent and expensive repairs.  Many of the buildings are not used as office space
