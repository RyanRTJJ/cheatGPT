, jealousy, sadness, and happiness) and the causal patterns associated with these categories.[18] Social scientists may also be trained to focus on specific aspects of emotion that are easily measurable, e.g., feelings of hurt, pain, fear, resentment or confusion, although these labels themselves may be subjective (but typically, in terms of their own meanings, not absolute). The goal of these social scientists in a given field is to construct and characterize social constructs of emotions (e.g., happiness, anger, fear, jealousy, sadness) in order to understand these constructive behaviors. Theoretical models of social emotions have been developed by social psychologist Ronald Dube (1994; 1995) and colleagues in the framework of the affective phenomenology, which uses the five basic emotions as a conceptual schema to describe the complex and multidimensional emotional systems underlying such complex behaviors.[19] The theory offers three levels of analysis: the affective phenomenology, the conceptual model, and the psychological theory.[20] We will review the basic theory of the human affective phenomenology and discuss some aspects of the theory relevant to our current task.

For one, we will examine how different conceptualizations of human emotion can affect how we see emotions and how emotions are theorized in both qualitative and quantitative terms. There are two types of affective phenomenology in affective psychology. The first is phenomenology that is based on phenomenological theories of emotion such as the theory of mind (Riley, 2000; Singer, 2009), the cognitive theory of affect (Coulson, 1967; Frith, 1978), and/or
