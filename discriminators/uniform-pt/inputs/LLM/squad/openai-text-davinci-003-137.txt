avian, Neo-Shtokavian dialects, Old and Church Slavonic, Serbian, Croatian, etc.) have changed drastically over time. Throughout the Middle Ages, the South Slavs spoke several dialects which were heavily mixed with either Old Slavonic or Greek, and were mainly used in a spoken form. Gradually, certain dialects started to be used more widely throughout the region and ended up being established as the standard literary languages of the various South Slavic nations. In more recent times, these literary languages have become standardized further and used in both formal and informal communication.

In terms of written languages used by the South Slavs, the most widely accepted is Standard Serbian, which includes variants of both Neo-Shtokavian and Neo-Chakavian. This was established after the break up of Yugoslavia in 1992, and is the standard language for Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Other written languages such as Croatian and Slovenian are used by the respective countries in corresponding regions, as well as in some of the other former Yugoslav states. While these languages have evolved over time along with the literary forms of their respective nations, cognates and similarities can still be found with Old Church Slavonic and Old Slavonic. 

Overall, the South Slavs have gone through a long and varied language history, with many different dialects and written languages developing over time. Despite this, these languages still retain strong ties to their historical roots and continue to be used by many different cultures.
