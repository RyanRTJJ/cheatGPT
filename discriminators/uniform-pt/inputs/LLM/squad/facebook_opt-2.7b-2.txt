 regime had a "strategic partnership" with Al Qaeda and that there was still no clear evidence of Saddam having sought to buy weapons of mass destruction (WMD), though he had long possessed them.

The administration, citing WMD, began a campaign of persuasion and covert action against Iraq, which they believed could bring Saddam to his knees: first with the "coalition of the willing" -- including Saudi Arabia and Jordan -- as the principal actors; then, as in Lebanon, with U.S.-backed Israeli forces fighting on Iraq's side; and finally, as in Bosnia, with NATO and other UN allies acting as proxy proxy forces. These policies involved numerous failures, leading to the decision to invade Iraq -- which had long been ruled by Uday Hussein and his brother Qusai -- on the basis of evidence collected during the Gulf War.

The invasions of Iraq and Yugoslavia were followed by U.N. sanctions designed to bring Saddam's regime to heel. The sanctions were not successful at achieving their aims, although much evidence has emerged since then of Hussein doing all he could to defy the U.N. and the inspectors, using illegal means to sell oil, obtain weapons, and procure nuclear material for nuclear weapons.

Saddam's regime was forced to accept the terms of the Iraqi no-fly zone and a no-drive zone in the southern half of the country, in exchange for an end to aerial bombardment of northern and western Iraq (which had been carried out by U.S.-led coalition aircraft and which had destroyed much of northern Iraq). The sanctions did not, however, prevent Hussein being able to access oil by other means. In September 1998, Saddam invaded Kuwait, in violation of the no-drive zone set in place for Iraq. Iraqi ground combat began two weeks earlier.

U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan appealed to the Security Council to demand that Iraq withdraw all its ground combat troops from Kuwait. Instead, the Security Council adopted Resolution 687 on March 12, after an initial resolution was vetoed by the U.S. The resolution authorized the member countries of the U.N.
