 million passengers were carried every year in the United States in conventional, cable-borne elevators. See D. Chappell & V. Davis, "Cable-Borne Elevators-A Review of Safety Issues," ESIEE Transactions, vol. 37/4 (April 1997), pp. 431-458.
Conventionally, cable-borne elevators are mechanically driven. For example, the elevator cab is driven and controlled by an electrically and mechanically complex hoist machine, which also supplies electric power to the machine itself. There are two major disadvantages to cable-borne elevators with this mechanical drive train configuration. These are the high cost associated with the hoist machine, and the complexity in elevator installation.
A great deal of energy is lost in a conventional elevator's mechanical drive train due to friction or friction-like effects of moving parts. As indicated in the table below, the power required to move the cab of a 20,000 pound cab, with or without passengers, is relatively high.
In contrast, electric motors are the least complicated, most efficient, and least expensive system for moving an elevator cab. It is estimated that 60% or more of the energy efficiency of electrical elevators are lost in the drive train due to friction losses and other factors in the mechanical drive train. The cost savings can be even greater because much equipment is required for an elevator's mechanical drive train, in addition to any electrical gear.
Other advantages of an electric cab over a mechanical cab are discussed in detail below.
In contrast to conventional cable-borne elevator systems using conventional drive trains, the present invention uses an energy conversion device consisting of a solid state switch and a super conducting magnet. The magnet has two energy conversion elements, a linear motor and solenoid, the combination of which form a switch capable of directing the energy of a current at two locations simultaneously. Because of the magnetic field within the magnetic switch, the switch's output is much less lossy than mechanical switches. See Chappell and Davis, "Cable-Borne Elevators-A Review of Safety Issues".
It is to these and other objects of the present invention that the invention is directed.
