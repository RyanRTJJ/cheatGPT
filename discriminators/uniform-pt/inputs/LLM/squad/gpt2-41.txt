 Matherman, and was convinced that the colony should be allowed to cultivate the crops. The colonists, though, were unable to resist Mather's invitation to invest the money in cotton. Matherman would later become known as the founder and first owner of the cotton field in New York City.

Tackling the Problems of the Cotton Farm

The colony had begun growing cotton on the outskirts of New York City and had begun to produce a large crop out of it. The colony was also using its own growing equipment to harvest and transport the seeds and plant them on city streets in order to raise money for its education programs. One reason for the colony's success was its ability to grow the cotton itselfâ€”it contained the necessary amount of calcium and phosphorus to sustain a healthy population. However, in 1754 Cotton Matherman began to find other ways to deal with cotton issues. In 1787 a small-scale, grain-growing, grain and soil-farming colony of about 5,000 inhabitants were established in central Missouri. With this initial success, farmers began to grow crops with more success. By the following year, after a period of years, production started to be interrupted by heavy rains. By the end of the 1790s, the crop population had reached 2,250 acres and Cotton Matherman built a plantation on the spot, located on an almost empty plain in the middle of the city.
