 but private expeditions by wealthy merchants who hired Chinese guides in order to bring wealth home to their families. Thus, Tibet had actually lost its way with the Mongols in their pursuit of trade. It had lost its way completely at that precise moment [Wang and Nyima, p. 40]. They are not clear if they mean that the Mongols were pursuing trade as a means for their own profit, or whether to trade for wealth. If the latter, Tibet's loss is a problem not necessarily of trade as a means of profit but rather of profit alone. The fact that the Ming court set up diplomatic delegations to Tibet, rather than for its own gain, suggests that the Han Chinese were, in their search for wealth, seeking to obtain aid from Tibet.

The Chinese were also pursuing trade in Tibet. There were indications that Tibet was trading with China by 1398, when an expedition led by Liu Zhizan arrived. The purpose of the expedition was to secure more timber for the Chinese Emperor Wu. By 1300, Liu had come to Tibet and in 1300, the three largest Tibetese armies sent to the Mongolian border from the three Chinese provinces of Qing and Tibet had been defeated and killed by Mongol archers before they returned to China. Thus, by 1300, the Mongols were winning the game of Tibet's economy.

A more recent example of trade between Tibet and China can be found in the 1395-1207 Yuan Dynasty. The Yuan Emperor Li Kuang was visiting a Buddhist temple in Tibet and on the way out of Tibet his envoy was taken prisoner by the Tibetans. Li Kuang was later executed. Thus Li Kuen became the leader of a Buddhist kingdom in Tibet that ruled most of southern China until the Yuan Dynasty. By
