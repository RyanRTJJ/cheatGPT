 is home to two distinct types of plants, one of which is adapted to extreme desert conditions and the other to moisture. In fact during times of very dry weather, these regions dry up completely, with the only plants surviving being grasses, shrubs and other low growing desert plants. Of course, water is also essential to all life but it is critical in the formation of the largest component of the desert – the sands.

Sandstorms are the desert’s bane. The most destructive sandstorms occur in the western desert (in Nevada and New Mexico) where the wind speeds may exceed 230 km/hr. Sandstorms are not uncommon during mid-summer and early fall as well. These storms can last for as little as a day, but because of the vast expanse and the wind can rapidly spread the sand and cover large distances in a matter of hours. The amount of sand is so enormous that after a storm over a given area would cover the area of 4 football fields with sand in about 1 day and cover a 100 football fields by the following day, as well as covering a huge area over a few short hours. In contrast these storms have only a small effect on a few kilometres of desert and their destructive power is limited.

Sandstorms in the Great Basin (Nevada and Utah)

The most well-known form of sandstorm occurs in the Great Basin region of Nevada and Utah – and is sometimes just referred to as a sandstorm. In these storms, sand is deposited by the wind and the resulting storm can be very large, covering the desert area from east to west. These storms typically last only a few hours and they usually occur when temperatures reach about 25 degrees Celsius but can occur as early as during the winter. The largest storm ever recorded was in 1976, covering more than 500,000 square kilometers.

The sand that is deposited is in the form of ‘little grains’. These little grains are light brown and usually are finer than a human hair. Small particles are also produced from larger ‘grains’. As sand storms occur over a wide area, many different types of desert plants and small animals are killed by
