, the total haplomal genome of Europe (Europe, Poland, Germany & the UK) would have been about 9% less than previously estimated.

The Druze population of the North Lebanon was the only population in the Middle East that had a more recent genetic history when compared to other populations. The authors note that genetic distances for the Druze and their immediate neighbors seem to have been driven by more recent shared ancestors.

For the most part, genetic analysis of the populations of North Lebanon, the other Druze populations residing in Lebanon, and other Middle Easterners revealed relatively little variation regarding their geographic origins and the timing of their migration. Most North Lebanese speakers belong to a separate genetic type defined by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y chromosome lineages. The mitochondrial DNA haplogroup T-M81 was one of the most prevalent mtDNA haplogroups in Lebanon, followed by mtDNA haplogroup A. The Y chromosomal lineage was derived from the Middle Eastern Khazars.

Ridley et al. (2009) describe the Druze language family, which comprises a collection of related Indo-European language families. Their phylogenetic analysis of this language family indicated a population split from northern, north-central, and other neighboring populations and a greater genetic distance to Iranian populations.

Several studies of mtDNA and Y chromosome markers have compared the Lebanese Druze and Israeli Jews, and showed the Druze to be more closely related to Palestinian Arab populations. These studies found mtDNA and Y chromosome haplogroups typical of Druze populations to be highly similar to that of Israel's Jews.

The most recent study was performed by
