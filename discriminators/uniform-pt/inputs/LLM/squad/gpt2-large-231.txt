Around 800 there were settlements along the west coast of Ireland, and there is evidence that Viking ships also visited the north coast of England between 800-600 BCE. According to the Bible, which suggests Viking sailors were largely Norsemen, Scandinavian settlement in Ireland reached its high point around 900 BCE.

The invasion of England by Viking ships appears to have been the only time when England or England was invaded by another culture – the Vikings were already moving northward – and they would have faced considerable challenges. During 500-900, the inhabitants of Britain were a nomadic people – the Norse were
