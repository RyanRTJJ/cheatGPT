 gym before matches. But it was basketball he became interested in. Playing for the school team, Schwarzenegger says, he "went right out there to the gym and started learning. I couldn't wait, you know." After winning the state championships, he transferred to UCLA. While there, he also played football.
By his sophomore year, he played for a pro-level team, but when he graduated, he stayed at UCLA to train for the 1976 Olympic Games. "I wasn't even on the first Olympic team to try out, or the second," he said. "I was just one of the last guys who was training and didn't make it. But it was a learning curve, and I think I learned a lot from it."
That experience, he says, made him grow up. "You learn a lot about yourself right there," he said. "Because the way I looked at it before I went to the Games, was that I was bigger, stronger and more talented than everybody. And all of a sudden, I saw that I wasn't."
He was also able to put the Olympics behind him and focus on things he cared about, like his fitness and bodybuilding.
By the time he hit 30, he felt a lot more comfortable with himself. "I was at a point where I was not worried about being a male model or an actor," he said. "Because then, it was so different that you were just there. It was just who you were."
In 1980, he appeared on TV to promote the Olympics. "I think it got me a lot more notoriety than if I hadn't done it," he said, adding that the experience taught him valuable lessons about public outreach.
A year later in 1982, Schwarzenegger entered politics. He campaigned for the California Guv with his first wife, Mariano. "My first campaign, I had to campaign like nobody was going to vote for me," he said. "It was the biggest challenge of my career, to get people to listen to me talk. And the reason I did it was because I loved the people of California."
He won with 78% of the vote, and ran for governor a second time in 1984. Schwarzenegger
