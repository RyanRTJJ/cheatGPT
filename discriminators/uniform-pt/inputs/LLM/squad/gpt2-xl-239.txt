 the "Caucasian tribes." They were mostly nomadic, cultivating corn, grazing animals, and growing flax, hemp, and bamboo, but a few remained permanently on the land. In about the third century BC, a tribe called Jinshi established a colony near the modern city of Shenzhen in the northern part of today's Zhejiang Province. They were the first Caucasians to settle in Northern China, and the name "Jinshi" is taken from their official capital, Shijiazhuang.
