 of secret germ warfare tests on the public". 

The report, from the Royal Society, indicated a terrorist attack was simulated using a mixture of potentially dangerous chemicals, such as sulphur compound, zinc cadmium sulphide, and bubonic plague bacteria, released at various locations in England, Scotland and the Isle of Lewis, and over the North Sea. It concluded that the tests could have led to “unintended consequences”, such as an increased risk of cancer.

The report also said that the tests had been insufficiently monitored and their potential dangers not fully appreciated by those involved. It also warned that it was not possible to assess "all the potential consequences". 

The government issued an apology to those affected by the tests and said it regretted that such experiments had taken place. It also said it could not rule out the possibility of injury to human health. 

The Guardian report noted that there was little detail in the report on a range of controversial tests, such as the alleged release of toxins, including polonium, over the Salisbury Plain, and the development of an artificial fog using silver iodide to blanket parts of the South of England. The report concluded that the ethics and safety of some of the experiments had not been properly assessed.
