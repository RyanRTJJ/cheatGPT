 be rooted in pagan rituals, although the pagan origin of these customs is often debated due to the lack of evidence.

During the late medieval period, Carnival was an opportunity for people to enjoy themselves and have fun before the austerity of Lent. Customs included masquerading in costumes, eating lavish meals, and indulging in bawdy plays and performances. People often adorned themselves with bright clothing, masks, and even gold jewelry. Music and dance were also staples of Carnival celebration, as were feasting and drinking.

In some areas, Carnival also included public displays that ridiculed the Church and its leaders. For example, Carnival parades often featured spectacles such as effigies of the Pope and other Church figures being burned or otherwise humiliated. 

Carnival also provided a space for people to express tensions in the social hierarchy. Nobles and clergy were often caricatured, while commoners and nonconformists were celebrated. During Carnival, the powerful were often lampooned and those who were usually below them could have their moment in the spotlight.

Today, many of the European Carnival traditions that have survived to modern times reflect these medieval roots. In some places, corpse-like effigies, known as 'oudenors', are still carried in parades. In others, legends of wild hedonistic nights, orgiastic rituals and confrontational performances still provide the backbone of the celebrations today.
