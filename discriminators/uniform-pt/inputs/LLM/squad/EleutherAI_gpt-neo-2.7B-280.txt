 was a great difference. An earlier invention, the phonograph was much more complicated. Using magnetic needles in spinning discs, the mechanism controlled how quickly a disc spun around, and the speed at which sound was recorded on it, while the phonograph was simpler, and could only record and reproduce sound.

It was only then, in July of 1877, that Mr. Thomas Edison, a teetotaling inventor of America, was approached by a gentleman who was looking for a new kind of musical device. This was John Henry Woolley, a wealthy man, an inventor, a man who had built the first commercial steam ship, and had been president of the Edison Company. Woolley approached Edison with a new invention: a phonograph.

The idea behind the phonautograph was relatively simple: a recording disc that could both record and playback sound, like the phonograph but with two advantagesâ€”the discs did not need to be inserted into an external device, such as the phonautograph, and the discs could be moved without much effort from anywhere you wanted them to be.

Woolley was convinced, despite his teetotaling past, that the phonograph was such a superior device, that there were many more phonographs on which he was going to record, than could ever be invented. Woolley asked Thomas Edison in for a quick test, to see if he had the goods, and to be sure he could not only record, but also to produce sound at the same time, that no one else had managed.

Edison performed the test,
