 and proposed Jerusalem be established as a separate international entity administered by the UN. The plan was approved by a vote of 33 to 13, with support from the United States and the Soviet Union. 

Despite the plan's approval, it never fully took effect due to the on-going Arab-Israeli conflict. This plan led to ongoing decades of armed hostilities, the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, and the Six-Day War of 1967. In 1992, the Madrid Conference began negotiations for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that is still being sought today. 

The UN Partition Plan has been both praised and criticized over the decades. Supporters emphasize that the plan's objective was to reach a compromise, allowing Jews and Arabs to peacefully coexist in the region. Detractors criticize the plan for creating an unequal division of land and resources, arguing that it forced the Palestinian Arab population to accept less than what they wanted and leaving them powerless in future negotiations.

Today, the UN Partition Plan is seen as a significant event in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its legacy is still felt throughout the region. Although its implementation was unsuccessful due to the failure of both sides to reach a peace agreement, it remains the starting point for negotiations to this day.
