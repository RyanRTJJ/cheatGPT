εόφωτοι) occur as war allies and opponents of the Achaeans. However, the question has been asked whether Danaans and Argives were ethnic groups, defined by blood, or merely tribes of the same people: the former being the name given to a people which would have been defined simply by place of origin, while the latter refers to two ethnic groups which lived in close proximity to each other but were not the same ethnicity.

If Danaans and Argives were ethnic groups, then perhaps the conflict between them and the Achaeans (who came originally from the Argives and Achaians) is traceable to ethnic prejudice, since the Ionians, Athenians and Spartans had a blood tie to the Argives.

However, the people called Danaans and Argives are described as people of Troy and Argos, respectively, and while Troy appears to have been the name of one of the cities associated with the group called Danaans, it is difficult to believe that there was some close blood tie between the Danaans and Troy. Argos, in contrast, never seems to have been associated with the Danaan tribes in any way. As for the fact that the Ionians had close blood ties with Argos but were not in any way considered to be Danaans, this too is difficult to reconcile given that it was the Danaans themselves that fought and were defeated by the Achaeans in the Catalogue of Ships. Finally, it makes no sense that any ethnic grouping which fought from Ilion would have chosen that name since they were not from this region.

It seems that if the Danaans and Argives were any kind of ethnic grouping, they were named so simply due to the physical location in which
