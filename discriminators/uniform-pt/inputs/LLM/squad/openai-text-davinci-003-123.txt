, shape, purpose and focus. In many countries, they evolved from technical colleges, vocational courses, apprenticeships, working men's colleges and training schools.

Polytechnics used to focus on providing technical training to students and often formed the basis of the British technical education system. Institutes of Technology were created mainly to meet the demands of industry, offering an education with a practical, industry-specific focus.

In the UK, there is a distinct difference between these two types education, as well as their roots. Polytechnics were established in 1969 as a result of an effort to upgrade technically trained professionals to degrees. Institutes of Technology on the other hand are focused on vocational and industrial training, rather than academic research and degrees. Institutes of Technology may also offer apprenticeships and industrial based-qualifications.

In the US, there are no true institutions referred to as “polytechnics”, although there are many technical and vocational schools that may offer degrees and certificates in various technical fields. Institutes of Technology are much more focused on providing technical training than most American institutions are, as they are often run by representatives of industry and they primarily serve the industrial sector rather than academic research.

In conclusion, while there is now some overlap between Polytechnics and Institutes of Technology, historically speaking, the two institutions have very different origins, focuses, and educational structures. Polytechnics historically provide higher educational services, whereas Institutes of Technology are focused on industrial and vocational training.
