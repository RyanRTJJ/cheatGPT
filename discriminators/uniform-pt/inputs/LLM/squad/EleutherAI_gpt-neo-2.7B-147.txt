 have originated with Irish traditions. The origins of Carnival are unknown, but may relate to celebrations for harvest, such as the Leodiceans Feast (known as the Feast of the Three Kings, from three kings, known as "the four Brethren").

The origins of the first Carnival in Italy in 1254 are related to Pope Nicholas IV's desire to find a way to celebrate the Feast of the Cross. Nicholas wanted to celebrate the end of Christ's Life on earth and the start of the Feast of the Cross, also known as Pardon, which was observed by many communities in Italy. In the Pope's desire to use the celebration for other purposes, he brought his brother, Charles of Anjou, to Italy to have Carnival celebrated.
