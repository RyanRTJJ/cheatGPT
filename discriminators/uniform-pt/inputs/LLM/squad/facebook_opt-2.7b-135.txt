 it on a par with Sweden (ranked 2nd) on the EZPAL Index of the EZPAL Countries. However, Estonia has suffered from rapid depolarization and deindustrialization since the late 1980s. Estonia has been plagued by high unemployment, declining manufacturing, and the withdrawal of industry from its urban centers. The country's government, while pursuing reforms, has faced strong resistance from labor unions.

Capital: Tallinn

Geography: Southeastern Europe, land of the Kalejas and Laps of the 16th century (pre-Riigikogu) and known then for its fishing and sea-faring trade with Russia.

Climate: Summers are warm, although snowy during winter, while winters often experience freezing temperatures (with possible snowfalls of 10-15 cm), as well as spring and autumn rains. In the north, the climate is continental, mild and moist. It is a humid continental climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification Ffa), but still has a fair amount of microclimates, though nothing like the Northern European climate.

Topography: Tallinn lies on the shore of a narrow bay. The northern shore area is a mountainous region that includes forests, while the surrounding area is mostly plains. Tallinn and the south have a hilly and wetland region, and the northwest and southwest consist of a more continental and dry climate, which is dominated by the vast forests that cover the area. Eastern Estonia hosts a small lake which has grown into a small sea.
