The genus is not very well studied, only some small taxa and a number of genera are known among which two have been discovered since 2004. The first was a genus called Eustala, which was found in the northern part of the Indo-Pacific Ocean, off the west coast of Peru. This was a relatively large animal, the last known fossils of which are from the mid-Atlantic region between Bermuda and the US east coast. This genus was named for the type locality Eustala. Eustala is still classified by the order of its fossil record.

The second genus, Polychaetes, was previously classified based on the fossil record but the lack of bones resulted in the classification not being well agreed on. Until recently, a common group of fossils that referred to all of the genera Eustala and Polychaetes was called "Eustala-Polychaetes group", a name that was later changed to either "Eustala-Megalonychids group" or "Megalonychididae".

More recent data, combined with new data obtained from other fossil formations, has been put forward, putting Eustala and Polychaetes together in the same order, but with some species having only one lineal descent of their lineage and others having many lineages. Most species of polychaetes are derived from one group (Eustala or Polychaetes), but some have branches from multiple groups. The genus was named after the location Eustala in the northwestern region of the Pacific Ocean, near the mouth of the Amazon River. This area hosts a large collection of taxa from the early Eocene, about 56-42 mya. Eustala and its two sister groups are considered to be representative of the polychaetine group, including
