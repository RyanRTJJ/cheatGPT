The move comes after a year of protests over what they call the 'disaster' in the country's distribution of electricity.

Thousands have protested at the island's ports, where they say their electric bills have plunged.

'Big black box'

Mr Blunt was the first speaker to call for a change in energy policy at the conference.

Speaking about the impact on power prices in the long-term, he said: "The main thing to remember is, for Puerto Rico, they are not just one big system, they're one giant, and the only way we can go forward is to bring them all together."

Mr Blunt also said he would not support "big black boxes" in energy prices: "Some people may think this is just an excuse for what's going on here, and you might as well blame the President [for] that.

"But let's change the power of the American people. That's what we will do. We will make sure that their electricity is back on and their power is back on at their own prices."
