 transformed the way we think about and write about race, gender, and sexuality under capitalism.

In May, the book publisher Verso invited me to speak at the Oxford Literary Festival, to promote a new edition, edited by McRobbie and Jessica Hughes, of my seminal book Fanonian Futures: Blackness and the Modern Subject (with a lengthy introduction). The book rethinks the Fanon-McCarthy/Louis Proyart controversy from an ideological, rather than a chronological, perspective. The introduction provides context to modern race politics and situates these debates in Europe and America within a transnational political economy and intellectual imaginary.

I'm grateful to Jameson, whose book Marx's Transitional Program (1984) is my go-to text on the role of transnational imaginaries in the Left, and to Jameson's critics who have extended his insights in important ways.

The Fanon-McCarthy affair is a perfect example of how a politics of the Left is sometimes lost or silenced by a politics of the Right. The right in France, where Fanon's views on the Algerian revolution were fiercely opposed by Maurice Papon, the founder of the fascist "National Rally," made sure that the book containing his views, The Wretched of the Earth, was either banned in French high schools or not published in French, and indeed in most French universities. By contrast, the Algerian government allowed his books to be published in Arabic by a French author. The French right tried to have it banned in the USâ€”although Fanon's writings on Algerian nationalism never had that much resonance
