 any era, it was still the Xbox's seventh-straight year at the top, and the Xbox 360 still ranks as the top-selling Xbox console of all time.[19] At this point, the Xbox 360 held a 19.3% share of units sold in North America, as well as a 40.6% share of the market in its native Russia, despite several years of decreased sales.[20] In 2014, IGN ranked the Xbox One a sixth place on their list of the top 25 video games consoles of all time. Although the Xbox One's sales were slightly lower in their 2016 report, it earned its spot. Its overall rank at the time ranked 18th overall out of 100 video game consoles.[21]
