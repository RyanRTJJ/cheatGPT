 conclusions. They showed that the so-called Y-chromosome bottleneck has been a relatively recent phenomenon. This meant that the ancestors of modern Ashkenazi Jews didn’t diverge genetically after being enslaved in Egypt, but instead, had more recently left their ancestral homeland of South Asia, and likely India, and migrated to Mesopotamia when Egyptian civilization collapsed sometime around 1500 BC. As Richards wrote last year in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: “At the time of conquest by the pharaohs, Ashkenazi genetic material had become widespread throughout southern Asia.”

And while this is good news at first sight, things could turn dark if the researchers – with all of their assumptions and conclusions based on limited data – are somehow to be believed. When that happens, geneticists are going to start to worry that the whole story is going to change.

In short: It’s a very big deal.

As Richards noted last year, “If we are right and recent human migration in Africa and Arabia took place before 1000 bc, it will have very significant implications for the nature of ancient populations.”

The consequences, however, are hard to predict. It remains to be seen what will happen if one day we do find ancient DNA from a people somewhere in the far-off past, which show differences from the supposed Ashkenazi.

It seems that for more than ten thousand years, at least, the general appearance of humans has remained largely unchanged.
