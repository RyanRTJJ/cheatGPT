ingly insincere; and as showbiz, it's a real rags to riches story of a troubled rapper struggling to survive and to build himself with more conviction."

A lot of the reviews, while giving it high marks, noted the fact that the show would be a perfect foil for other musical programs on the air.

For some critics, however, this could not have been a more unfortunate decision. The show has been called a mockery to the genre, and a "disruptive" to mainstream musical representations. As one television writer of The Hollywood Reporter characterized it "for years a paragon of musical blandness, it now shows a willingness to be anything but."

There is obviously a lot of room for improvement, but I hope that NBC will give it another try. As a fan of the show, I hope that the new executive producers pick up the franchise and turn it into something that has legs. It is already very popular on the internet despite the fact that the show is still being produced in America. So I hope that The Voice will find a different home for it.
