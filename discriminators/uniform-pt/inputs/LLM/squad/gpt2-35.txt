 Great Lakes and the Pacific. Subsequently it became the central sea-ice state of the Western Hemisphere; it is thought to form on the South Atlantic, the Gulf and the Arctic Ocean.

Consequently, the area below its present size is the home of the biggest diversity of mammals (including marine mammals, bivalves, birds, reptiles and other animals) observed in New England this century. Its composition is also well understood, and is being reported in other coastal communities and islands worldwide.

More of the same is about to happen around the world, and it is already changing the landscape quite a lot, so the role it plays might seem trivial (such as for the population of an island or some of some of the wild islands), but in reality today, its role is truly unprecedented.

Habitat

A wide range of climate (especially during the time the climate was warm) is causing the ocean to warm. It tends to be a very rich sea. We would argue, however, that some of it is due to greenhouse gases such as coal and gas heat and that others will undoubtedly be due to ocean acidification.

In much of Asia, the tropics, and the Gulf of Mexico can contribute to the warming of the entire planet, but they are extremely sensitive regions to these changes.

Climate Modelling and Climate Change

In response to CO 2 concentrations, the Earth has been warming greatly and
