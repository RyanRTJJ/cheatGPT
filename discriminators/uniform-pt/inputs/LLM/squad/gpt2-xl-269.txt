 of the desert has the greatest rainfall - around 200mm or so a year. The average rainfall near the central and eastern part of the desert is around 50mm. As a result of this situation, irrigation can only occur through the middle and upper reaches of the desert.

Although rainfall is minimal, water is needed for various reasons. One major need is for the crops used to make wine. There are several thousand small wine-producing vines in the central desert, and about half of them are located near the edge of the desert. As the rain does not reach these vines, the water from the surface of the air has to go somewhere. This water moves towards the foothills, where there is more rainfall, or to the south to irrigate grapes for wine that is made for export and to sustain large areas of grape irrigated land.

What sort of rainfall is found in the desert?

Some important meteorological observations have been made in the deserts of the Middle East and North Africa, but they are mainly based on local measures. This makes it difficult to make a direct comparison between the areas. A study is needed from a meteorological point of view to compare the meteorological conditions in the desert of these regions with the desert of the Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula.

If meteorological observations in the deserts of the Middle East and North Africa are extrapolated to the Mediterranean and Arabian Peninsula, it becomes possible to make a more comprehensive comparison and, therefore, to draw conclusions on an international scale.

Most meteorological observations of the Arabian Peninsula have been made at the stations of Ain Jalut (in the desert of the southern tip) and the Al-Bareib observation base, which is in the desert of northern Saudi Arabia. These meteorological observations, mainly made over 30 years, were collected in a study completed by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) in 1990 and are published in the international journal, Theoretical and Applied Climatology. This project is particularly well suited for this study as, unlike national weather stations, it is located in a relatively dry, arid climate zone.

During these years, the weather stations at Ain Jalut also recorded precipitation in terms
