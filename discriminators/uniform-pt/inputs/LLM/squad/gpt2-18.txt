 Resources: A New Perspective."

John A. Jones and Jim Brown write that the role of FST in the persistence of homo-homo evolution has been neglected for far too long, and that the role of FST is not fully appreciated because in large part this role is a product of natural selection.

In a 2008 study on human populations over a two-year period, anthropological scholars examined a number of populations that were present on the planet before the formation of the current record: the Dampierians (about 150 million years old), the Hapats (about 30 million years old), Australopithecus (about 400 million years old), Homo Sapiens (about 300 million years old), and Lopquatt (about 300 million years old).

It has long been recognized that homo-homo evolution is not in the least supported by a natural history that includes a large number of complex groups, each of which is dominated by an unknown number of individuals.

However, when we turn a page to contemporary human populations, they are largely absent, much less homo-homo. This lack of evidence makes the conclusions that FST has no practical utility impossible to reach.

The F-TAS is not limited to those nations that are currently experiencing human extinctions:

I think this is really important because it is very important to see that this work shows that FST is a great thing. We already know that populations that had been in some way hominin (primarily human) populations are now homo-homo, but in some ways this is being attributed to their hominin ancestors. In the next few decades we are going to see more and more homo-homo in populations, a process
