), driest (15.3 litres per hectare) and most crowded centre (6.5% of population but 7.9% of land area). Even that, however, is a low bar, reflecting a lack of amenities and accessibility to key services. With a population of just over 4 million, St. John falls behind other Canadian cities in population that have more than 1 million citizens, and many of its major attractions do not draw much from urban sprawl (Newmarket Square is smaller than a football pitch and Victoria Park, in the north, is a mere 1km from a railway line).

As a result, St. John's has always been a major centre of city-wide activity and growth (a 2013 government report estimated the global city population would increase 25%). Its rich history – first as a settlement of Native North Americans, then part of Canada on the Atlantic seaboard for nearly 150 years – is what sets it apart from other places.
