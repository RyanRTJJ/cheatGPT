i Germany and the Holocaust provided a massive impetus to Jewish immigration, causing the Fifth aliyah to bring in close to 400,000 Jews between 1930 and 1939. In the 1940s, the period surrounding and following the Second World War bolstered immigration to Palestine, known as the Sixth aliyah.

The next major wave of aliyah occurred through the 1990s and 2000s, particularly during the period of Jewish emigration from the former Soviet Union, known as the Seventh aliyah. During this time, over one million Jews left the previously closed Soviet Union to resettle in Israel.
