er lands belonging to the French king.

John spent a lot of money lobbying the pope, who granted him authority over a number of the lands he coveted. However, the French king was not ready to give up his lands and refused to concede to John’s demands. John then responded to Philip’s refusal by launching a campaign of military aggression in an attempt to take the lands by force. This caused a prolonged conflict lasting several years, during which both sides launched several brief skirmishes and battles in various parts of France.

Finally, in 1214, John faced Philip in a decisive battle, which he lost and was forced to sign the Treaty of Le Goulet, which gave the French king control over the disputed lands. This treaty served as an important milestone in English-French relations and was a precursor to the eventual defeat of England by France in the Hundred Years War.
