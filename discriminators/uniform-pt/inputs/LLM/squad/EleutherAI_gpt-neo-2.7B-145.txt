ased tissue or an organ can be directly inoculated on the surface of a growth medium. Microbial growth can occur on an otherwise sterile growth medium. This provides a surface where microorganisms can grow and multiply. The growth medium is then removed and the growth medium is typically incubated for a period of days in a climate chamber (37 or 75 degrees Celsius), which also supports for growth of the microorganisms in the culture to provide for a visible growth of the microorganism for analysis of the growth of the microorganism to provide for identification of the microbe. The incubation time provides for the microorganisms to multiply, often doubling in numbers every 24 hours. The colony and colony diameter can provide information on the number of organisms present in a specimen and/or the growth of the microorganisms in the organism.
Colonies growing on a growth medium, which is then removed from the growth medium, are generally called cultures. These cultures are subsequently identified and characterized. The methods to identify and characterize the microorganisms of these cultures are very time-consuming and expensive. The methods to isolate, culture, grow and maintain these cultures of microorganisms are very time consuming. These methods to isolate, culture, grow and maintain these cultures of microorganisms are highly complex and subject to error. Methods used in the culturing procedure, which can take several days for one day, are
