 Top (1973) was launched.

That time period was also also a time of great musical innovation. Enter the "great funk" movement of the 1950s and the 1960s; with its early psychedelic effects and live concerts, the song "Penny Lane" and "Good Riddance" marked important milestones in rock and roll on the road.

Cooper returned to the studio to record the blues rock classic, The Star Spangled Banner in 1964. The album debuted at number nine on the Billboard 200 album chart, but had to settle for number three on the American music charts. The song is perhaps the most famous hit of the musical century; one of the most beloved rock and roll renditions ever recorded. This version included some added elements by Cooper that added to both the song's impact and, of course, to Cooper's stature as a guitar player.

On the other hand, the lyrics of this song's original lyrics – "When we lost our place by our bad deeds, let us try to go back to it"—were completely different than what you would expect in the later verse. By contrast, they are a key part of John Wesley Harding's lyrics from his great novel The Great Gatsby. What better place to introduce you to the musical and lyrical aspects of Harding's lyrical influences than here, a short film?

The entire film is available for the home, classroom and family viewing audience; and you can also see the rest of the film here. The Great Gatsby's influence is most apparent today when you go watch it, because it tells the story of a wealthy and socially influential young girl named Gatsby, a great jazz musician and lover of the bluegrass music of the 1960s and 70s. Harding provides some of the best words in the film, and in the music used in the film; and he uses his unique lens to give you the very first musical references to the phrase "if your heart isn't your blues."
