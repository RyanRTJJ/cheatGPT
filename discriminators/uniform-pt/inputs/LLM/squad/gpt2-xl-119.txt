 rich French province of Lorraine. In 1152, John was able to negotiate a treaty with Philip. There was no longer any major schism between the English and French courtiers. The agreement brought peace between both monarchs and secured the safety of the English nation. John, then, decided on one more ambitious idea: he would attack, conquer and subdue the French king in order to finally establish himself as the one and only legitimate English monarch! John's intention was made even clearer when he ordered his courtiers to prepare for military service; he was determined to become the most powerful king in western Europe and would not stop until he was there.

By April of 1153, Philip had been forced to negotiate the treaty: John would continue to command in France while Philip would accept control over Normandy and Anjou and would leave Anjou and Lorraine in the hands of the English. John then took his wife Margaret, daughter of the Earl of Warwick, and their children and left for France. John would be forced to contend with other English opponents including William de Bruyne, the Earl Marshal, on one side and the Duke of Burgundy, Duke de Villefort and his nephew, Robert Guiscard, on the other: these three men were the true powerbrokers in Burgundy and had the final say on who ruled the land.

To achieve English dominance (at least in western Europe), John planned to go "all the way to the French ocean."
