 tracks for data and subband or IEC 60915/2 surround sound information (analog FM stereo and AM stereo). Analog video could be encoded in PAL, SECAM, NTSC, SECAM, and PAL/SECAM.  NTSC video could be in any combination of NTSC, PAL, or SECAM format.  Digital video quality was typically 8 bits with a resolution of either 640×480 pixels with 16 colors or 640×480 pixels with 24 colors.

Subtitles were often handled with the analog component signal as audio (if encoded in digital format), with the audio output signal at audio surround format.  The analog NTSC audio output signal was usually encoded in either PCM format or Dolby Surround.  The analog audio component was sometimes encoded as PCM or Dolby. Some DVDs included an uncompressed component audio track for the same reasons.  While the uncompressed audio and component signal of a disk were commonly combined for the DVD player in order to minimize data stream transmission latency to the TV, the audio from the DVD player often was sent to the TV directly at the standard 24 kHz/16 bit sampling rate.

DVD data transmission was done in a standard form, which transmitted the DVD data on the same wire as other data such as audio and video.  The data signal is sent in what has come to be called a "stream", the length and the data type of which can be selected by
