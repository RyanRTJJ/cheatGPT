Evolution. In this series, the Digimon, rather than evolving from baby to adult forms, first Armor Evolve into special hybrid forms, by matching with a special type of Digi-Egg, which is usually worn as armor, a Digi-Core, or a special object. These Armor hybrid forms are known as Armor Digimon, and they become more powerful by further evolving into fully-evolved forms, known as Ultimate Digimon. The Digi-Destined in this series are a group of kids that are joined by Generation 2 Digi-Destined, who control the forces of good and evil in the Digital World. The series follows the three new main characters, Takuya, Kouji and Junpei, as they Armor Evolve and fight against the villainous Lucemon and his season forces, the "Gigasmon". The Digi-Destined save the Digital World by defeating Lucemon and restoring the Digital World to peace.

The fourth Digimon series aired on August 3, 2004 and continued the focus on Armor Evolution. It also added a new type of Digimon, the Burst Mode Digimon, which evolved from an Ultimate Digimon to an even greater form. The Digi-Destined in this series are partnered with both Spirit Digimon and Fusion Digimon, two types of Digimon which are able to combine to form a stronger Digimon. The series follows the new Digi-Destined, Kouichi, Koji, Zoe and Tomoki, as they fight against the evil Cherubimon and help to restore the Digital World to its former glory. In the end, the Digi-Destined defeat Cherubimon and save the Digital World, allowing peace and prosperity to return.
