 were important differences. First, it required no batteries. For its entire life, the phonograph was fueled by the same mercury-air fuel that powered the steam engines of the period. Second, it could not record. It was, in short, as useless as them and could not record sound without the use of an external microphone.

In 1910, when the United States entered into WWI and Germany invaded Belgium, several phonograph patents were obtained by firms in the United States under the direction of Edwin Tompkins, a lawyer and friend to Edison. The patent for the American phonograph machine is one of these, awarded in 1924. In the patent, its authors, Edison and Tompkins, claim that the phonograph machine consists of the two most unusual parts of any recording device, namely the record and the phonograph.

They claim the record (in this case a disk or disc) must be kept between an outer casing, the cover, and an inner shell of insulation of any material. Inside the shell the disk is laid on either side of an apparatus which has been constructed to receive and record sounds. The apparatus, the patent claims, contains an electric motor and is arranged in a horizontal position. The latter is called a turntable while the turntable is the part that is to be described in the next pages.

Before beginning the description of the turntable (after the date that the patent was issued in 1925), it will be necessary to define what constitutes a turntable. The patent
