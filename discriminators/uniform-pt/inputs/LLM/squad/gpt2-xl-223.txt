 This strengthening leads to a greater capacity for making new connections, especially in the hippocampus. The strong connections are important for retaining previously learned information and learning new information. Sleep has the greatest effect on learning. During sleep, cortical areas that control memory increase the numbers of neurons that produce memory-related excitations.

Brain plasticity

The brain's ability to change is enhanced when there is more activity in the synapses. This explains the ability of the brain to reorganize itself after learning. Activity in the prefrontal cortex produces long-term memory (LTM), while activity in the orbitofrontal cortex produces long-term changes in behaviour. These are thought to occur during sleep (Slee et al., 2016).

Sleep and emotions

Emotions are part of emotional, social and learning responses. They are influenced by both sleep and wakefulness. Emotions are linked to arousal, mood and motivation. The same neurotransmitter system is involved in emotion and learning. The neurotransmitter dopamine is the main neurotransmitter involved in emotion and learning. During sleep, dopamine is released into the brain, thereby increasing the level and efficiency of the neurotransmitter in the synapses. This is important for normal functioning of the brain.

Brain function during sleep may also have an impact on emotional and behaviour related to sleep. During sleep, the brain becomes more plastic. The brain contains less redundant neural pathways. The connections between neurons are strengthened, which means that information processed during waking life can be processed in sleep. This also allows information to be recalled over longer periods of time (Kanwisher, 2003).

Sleep-wake cycle

The sleep-wake cycle is determined by both genetic and physiological
