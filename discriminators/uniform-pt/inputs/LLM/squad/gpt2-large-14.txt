 manual on the sciences, "Naturalism" ("Naturalisme," in French), wrote the term in his first version as an allusion to a more advanced, more philosophical "Humanism."3 In the 1770s, the philosopher Leibniz, an admirer of the Romantic idealism of the French Philosophers, borrowed his own conception of "the real man" from his American colleague Descartes.4

By the late 18th century, the concept of a "Natural Man" had become much more rigidly determined by what the author claimed to understand about his subject; the American and British natural sciences (and the rest of mathematics) thus went from the "Humanistic" or "rationalist" conception to the "rationaliste" or "scientific man." The difference between the two notions was not simply one of content. One of the main aims of the term "rationalist" was to set up a model of a rational scientific method, to point to the way the science worked and to show the "scientific men" what their work must be in order to be true. The scientific man, like the natural scientist, looked for reasons, solutions to problems and explanations of things. But he rejected the ideas of a "God," a "universal" law (that is a reason), or "laws of nature," and denied that human understanding of nature was in any way divine, while he did not see "the law of necessity" as a reason. Instead, he wanted to discover why things happen as they do, why people in the world tend to behave in certain ways and why they must act to do so. It was on such aims that he set out to understand "Nature." In fact, his efforts, while they reflected his own ideas, were not directly inspired by human values, but were concerned with the problems faced by people in a world that seemed to be in turmoil.

In spite of all this, the term rationalist remained in use for
