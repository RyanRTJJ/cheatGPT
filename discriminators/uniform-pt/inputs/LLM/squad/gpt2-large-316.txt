oths detect radio frequencies. In the case of the moths this particular sensitivity is known as "night vision". In fact, one of the three most powerful types of vision in insects is visible light detection, meaning the insect's eyes can't see colors apart from red, blue and green.

This explains the insect's "hunting behavior": the female moths will stay away from an area during the day when they must have some food in order to lay their eggs on the vegetation. After that all the females leave that area, but the larvae of a few small moths still remain.

Moths are an exception to this rule as they stay in the same area throughout the winter. When all the larvae leave the area, the adults come back. This can only mean one thing. Moths are the only mammal with a circadian rhythm. This is more important than you might think, because the circadian rhythm is very important for the health and even survival of the animal. Without it, a mammal won't be able to spend as long as they should on the ground and they become very lethargic and very prone to disease.

Circadian rhythms are extremely helpful when it comes to hibernation but are also extremely useful in animal husbandry. Without them, small mammals like the moths would die and the animal would have very little or no chance of growing young. To be able to grow large
