The University of Bologna was founded by Boniface VIII to challenge the University of Paris. Peter of Corbeil and Boniface VIII were the most influential of the early university founders.

By the 1340s most of the surviving universities, some forty, were Italian and they were the most progressive in Europe.

The famous university of Salerno in Southern Italy was founded in about 1100 and became an intellectual cauldron by the fourteenth century.
