 of their orbital frequencies. "It's a simple but elegant procedure" that is powerful and flexible because "it doesn't require a set of equations to define a particle," says David Sobel, a physicist at the University of Texas at Austin.

As an example, one could imagine a hypothetical electron, which follows the same behavior with other charges as electrons do with their protons. If one were to imagine a set of charge-parity "spin-orbit" rules that correspond to the set of all the spin-orbit parameters of that hypothetical electron, then one could simulate the interaction of electrons, protons, and others with the same frequency as those particles.

Some physicists, as well as Nobel Prize winner Alexei Leonov, have proposed building a quantum computer — capable of simultaneously representing both atoms and particles — because of these capabilities, as well as for their theoretical flexibility. But building such a computer likely would take hundreds of years, if not longer — and the building blocks are at least another decade away.

One obstacle is quantum computers' inability to make measurements on their current hardware, which would be necessary to confirm whether a possible quantum circuit would be able to accurately represent a real physical system of atoms. In fact, a more useful tool might be to use a classical computer for a simulation, then analyze the results using a quantum computer, because the quantum computer can determine which set of numbers is likely to be correct, says Sobel.

To that end, some researchers think that a quantum computer might not be able to
