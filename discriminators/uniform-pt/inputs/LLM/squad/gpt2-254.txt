The pub is only set to open in October in the first quarter of next year, which would make it the latest in a series of bar counter expansions. It is also likely to be the first in the capital, where the company is planning to open several restaurants across two phases.

In the second phase, B.J. Weidenfeld said the company has a taproom at 300 Queen Street NW on the fourth floor and plans to open two pubs and a bar at the same location in the future.

An initial taproom at 150 Broadway is expected to open by the end of this year. The first will open at about 2 a.m., followed by a second, the company said.

Weidenfeld said the brewery will also be opening two more locations at Queen and Broadway, at 1027 N. Broadway and at 865 Queen St., at the same hour, between 8 a.m.-1 p.m. Sunday. They are about 7 km south of the former site.

Weidenfeld said that the taproom is expected to be open the next few years, according to a statement by the brewery.
