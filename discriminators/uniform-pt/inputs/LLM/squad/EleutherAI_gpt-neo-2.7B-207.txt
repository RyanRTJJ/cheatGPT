 ago, but these mixtures were considered dangerous because of toxicity, unpleasant taste, and difficulty in application ([@b14-0061286]). A new technology that replaced the medicinal folklore was the widespread use of antimicrobial soap.

The antimicrobial property of soap is derived from the fact that fats present in soap are antimicrobial. After they are extracted from the fat, the lipids, especially non-ionic triglycerides, lose their antimicrobial properties and can become an antiseptic or a deodorant for human skin. Most soap is extracted from natural oils, such as coconut, palm, and olive oil, or from industrial oils, such as castor, palm, arachne, and kajal. Commercial, chemically synthesized detergents, or synthetic surfactants, the soaps derived from natural oils, contain fatty acids or triglycerides, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, sodium coco glycolate, sodium coco fatty carboxylate, sodium cetearyl sulfoacetate, sodium citrate, sodium glycolate, and synthetic surfactants or detergents that contain fatty acid esters ([@b14-0061286]).

The antimicrobial property of soap is obtained by the direct contact of the lipids with the skin surface, and then the soap molecules are incorporated in the skin. The antimicrobial mechanism is based on the lipids' interaction with the skin's surface lipid matrix which leads to cellular dehydration and disruption of the integrity of the skin membrane ([@b22-0061286]).

Some studies indicate that the antimicrobial properties of soap are derived from the interaction of the soap itself with bacteria
