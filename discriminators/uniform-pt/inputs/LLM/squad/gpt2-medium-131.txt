) or menstruation (the time of the menstrual period of a father or mother) is thought to mark menopause in females (Singer et al., 1987; Kato et al., 2000; Mazziotti et al., 2007; Schaller et al., 2011).

From menarche the onset of puberty is thought to lead to development of clitoral or vaginal lubrication (Brockman, 1994; Miller et al., 2004). Some studies of the impact of menarche (de Waal, 2001; Lasker et al., 2010) indicate that menstruation at 15 months coincides with the onset of sexual desire and is followed by the onset of clitoral sensation and orgasm (Herman et al., 2003). The mechanism by which menarche influences the sexual development of women and their sexual relationships is unknown. The authors of this study hypothesized that menstrual cycles might have significant potentials of sexual dimorphism by altering neurochemistry, cognition (the capacity of an individual's brain to process images or impulses), and the social context of the individual (Lasker et al., 2010).

As indicated by their results in the present study, a more detailed discussion of the mechanisms of the women was not possible in previous studies. Here we consider the possible mechanisms that are responsible for the observed changes within women due to menarche in order to better evaluate the effect that menstruation has on women's sexual development.

Menstruation and Brain Maturation

The study aims to evaluate the effect that menarche has on sexual orientation. To achieve this goal we used the online survey of 1529 women between the ages of 20 and 35 years. These are people who were participating in a longitudinal study in the Danish Population Register (DenPd). Data from a subset of 2311 women from the population register was analyzed to determine the degree of menarche
