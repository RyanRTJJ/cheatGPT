"We decided we should be the first airport, and then it should be the world's oldest airport. We did it."

Wilbur died in 1925, the year after the Wright Brothers Company was incorporated, at the age of 44.

But he had spent all his adult life planning and working towards building an airport that could serve communities beyond the small
