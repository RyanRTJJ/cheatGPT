 the varying demands of their daily work. These requirements vary widely from individual to individual.

Even these early mammals were not free from trade-offs. Like all living things, a mammal's food needs change with the time and place it lives. For example the size and strength of the female could make or break a particular species of mammal; a predator that eats large numbers of food carcasses could turn into a much weaker, vulnerable creature as this becomes more common.

Other trade-offs were obvious for some animals, such as their ability to withstand the cold of their habitats. One thing every predator must do to survive is regulate their body temperature. Mice and rats are particularly efficient at this, as the cold also reduces the rate at which their metabolisms use oxygen to create energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). While a mammal's ATP stores are low, the faster a mammal's metabolism burns energy, the more its body temperature rises. The colder the temperatures, the worse off the animal. These trade-offs lead to the common phenomenon known as the thermostat effect. These trade-offs to a species' ability to maintain a high body temperature explain why some organisms evolved traits that would aid them in the colder environments of their ecosystems.

When the sun goes down

Some of the features of mammals at the top of this page illustrate these trade-offs. Since these ancestors survived and reproduced by hunting smaller prey, they developed a keen interest in temperature regulation. Their ability to regulate body temperature would also have
