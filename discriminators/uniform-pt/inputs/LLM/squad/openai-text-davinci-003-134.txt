Microsoft's decision to enable secure boot by default in Windows 8 has been heavily criticized by the free software community and other computer users, who argue that secure boot restricts the user's control over the device, prohibiting them from running operating systems or other software of their choosing. This has raised worries that manufacturers may choose to collude with Microsoft to restrict the range of software their devices will run. 

The main criticisms of Microsoft's decision to enable secure boot are that it limits user freedom, creates an unnecessary barrier to entry for non-Windows operating systems and software, and creates a potential for manufacturers to collude with Microsoft to limit what software their products will run. These criticisms have led some advocates of free and open source software to call for an end to the Windows 8 certification program and secure boot. 

Microsoft has attempted to address these criticisms by providing clear guidelines regarding secure boot and allowing users to turn it off or customize it. Microsoft has also introduced a process for creating a special key for users to add their own signed code, allowing users to run their own software.
