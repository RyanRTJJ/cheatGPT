). However, growing season is shorter in the humid tropics, and requires almost three weeks of the total summer heat of 1530 ± 120 °C (532 to 637 °F) and 10 h of night-time maximum temperatures of at least 1550 ± 75 °C (570-774 °F) [2]. In wet tropics the humidity is often below 30% [3], and in humid tropics the minimum temperature is always higher than in dry Tropics. The rainy season lasts from about July to October, which is also the rainy season in dry subtropics. The maximum temperature of the precipitation is usually around 20–29 °C (68–79 °F) in wet tropical areas and from about 4 to 15 °C (40–52 °F) in dry subtropics, and from about 8 °C (46–45 °F) in subtropics with high humidity to 26 °C (78 °F) and 45 °C (113 °F) in dry subtropics; temperature and humidity fluctuations are also associated with the wet and dry seasons. The wet and dry season occurs during the summer and the rainfall and the temperature differ significantly in tropical and subtropical areas [2]. The duration of the rainy season generally follows a natural rhythm and the corresponding days of maximum temperature vary more. Rainfall in the moist tropics occurs at an average rate of 6.4 mm (0%) of annual global mean precipitation [4], the frequency of rainfall in subtropical areas can exceed 30% of average precipitation [3].

Rainfall in dry subtropics during the wet season can occur in
