Following the failed invasion of 1213, Louis had to agree to peace terms with Henry. He made his position by accepting a number of humiliating agreements, the main provisions being that he would cede much of his own territory, to be reconquered by Henry in another invasion.

In 1223 Henry arranged to force Philip to relinquish his rights to the duchy, and thus, Normandy, by paying him the vast sum of 10,000 pounds of gold.[18] On 24 Sept. 1223, Philip signed away his rights to the duchy.[18]
