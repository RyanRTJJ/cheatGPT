 Australia, and other regions of the world have distinctive flora and fauna even in environments close to the equator, and even when environmental conditions are fairly close and uniform.  Darwin proposes that the characteristic species from regions outside of the Near East must, under the law of natural selection, evolve by means of a species producing variation that occurs in the wild.

Chapters XII to XXII cover aspects of zoology, with several hundred species mentioned, described, and discussed.  Darwin shows that many species possess an enormous range and that the same species may occur at widely distant points in the world.  He notes, particularly, that no species can be found in all parts of the world, and that some species are extremely common whilst others are exceedingly rare.  Darwin proposes that the rarity of some species can be explained by the law of numbers, but rejects the other explanation for rarity, that the presence of predators eliminates a species from an area.  Darwin also rejects Lamarck's hypothesis that species can alter characteristics under the action of the environment, proposing an alternative mechanism to produce variation â€“ reproduction or natural selection.

Chapter XIV examines the problem of extinction, with a discussion of the frequency of species in general, of distinct species in general, and of specific species in particular that is remarkably
