ased persons may be called a culture. Most cultures contain many organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, algae and certain pathogens. Such organisms might be identified by direct analysis of a culture, which typically takes at least weeks. However, as is the case here, the bacteria may persist in the microbial culture until death.

Other approaches may be more appropriate, such as direct immunization, which can target various bacteria in the culture. However, immunizations have been shown to prevent the acquisition of new pathogens.

In vitro fertilization (FIV) is a method for fertilizing yeast (Ursus sp.). It is characterized by an infusion of small droplets of egg-shaped cells called thiocyanin (a protein derived from the egg of an orca), which are incubated for 10 to 30 minutes in one of two ways:

In a microbe, the thiocyanin (the bacteria that produces thiocyanin) secreting the yeast cells, causes the yeast to proliferate and initiate an adult cycle of reproduction in the culture.

In a live culture, the sperm of two orca cells is injected into one another on either side of their membranes. During the process, the eggs pass into the uterus; these eggs then carry the cells into the uterus, where they carry the thiocyanin and can be fertilized or abortified.

The thiocyanin (a protein derived from egg and sperm) can then be given to multiple animals to stimulate the reproduction of the cells during the
