 they felt. Schachter believed the patients reported feeling good, but Marañón believed that only about one-third of his patients felt well after their injections.

In the years following, the scientific world took the first step into a scientific investigation on the effects of epinephrine on the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the autonomic nervous system, the endocrine, metabolic, secretory, circulatory, and immunological systems. It has been established that the autonomic system plays a key role in the body's response to illness, injury or major change, including the heart pounding and the feeling of extreme fatigue and weakness.

Schachter's research was important in that it demonstrated that when the ANS functions at normal level, we feel the way we know we should—we feel well. This well feeling comes from our sympathetic system, which increases the heart rate and keeps the blood circulating throughout the body even as the parasympathetic system, which slows down the heart beat and the release of hormones and other secretions, decreases. When we don't have a well-functioning ANS, we feel different and the result can be sickness or extreme illness.

As the medical literature continues to make progress on our understanding of the immune system, the adrenal glands are a main focus of study. As our bodies fight illnesses that originate on the level of the brain and nerve endings, the adrenal glands are a key part of our
