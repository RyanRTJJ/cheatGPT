The state's economy is dependent on several industries including mining, textiles, handlooms, handicrafts, and tourism. The state government of India declared that the population of the state, especially the urban areas, had a "high quality of living".

The states of Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh account for more than 22% of jobs in the Indian service sector. The state government's plans also include making Rajasthan a global education hub.
