In an attempt to prevent infections of the mouth and throat, women in the 13th century would gargle with a mixture of garlic and vinegar.[2] In the 19th century, many women used home remedies such as cayenne pepper, aspirin, opium, alcohol and opium to treat painful periods. In addition, herbal pain medicines for menstrual cramps were introduced by physicians William Harvey (1628-1704) and Jean-Luc Arnauld (1638-1695).[3][4]

The earliest known antibiotic is credited to Louis Pasteur, a French microbiologist whose research sparked the pharmaceutical industry. Pasteur received a doctorate from the University of Paris in 1865 and worked as a pathologist and bacteriologist for the government. In 1878, while working at the Institute Pasteur in Paris, he applied to the government to work on microbes. His first study of antibiotics was in 1881, and Pasteur produced them on a large scale in the same laboratory. After working on the germ theory of disease, though, he saw his work as more important. In 1901, he published an article with Louis Brugler and Louis Lallemand, describing the action
