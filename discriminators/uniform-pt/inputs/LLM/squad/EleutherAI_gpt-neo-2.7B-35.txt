 southern super continent of Gondwana and two landmasses, the other being Euramerica during the middle Jurassic and the northern supercontinent of Pangea during the late middle Jurassic.
Three major mass extinction events occurred in the Late Jurassic period (about 176.5 Ma to 145.0 Ma). They are the Permian–Triassic extinction when nonavian dinosaurs (and other groups of reptiles) went extinct; the end-Permian (about 245.0 Ma - 205.9 Ma) and the end-Cretaceous extinction (about 144.0 Ma - 90.8 Ma), when the dinosaurs went extinct; and the Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction (about 176.0 Ma to 145.0 Ma, the latter being caused by the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs), when nonavian dinosaurs went extinct.

The Permian–Triassic extinction event is the subject of the debate concerning mass extinction. Some believe that it is due to a catastrophic impact in North America. Others believe that it was due to a number of geological events, including volcanic eruptions and landslides from earthquakes. Scientists are still uncertain and have not reached a consensus on just how the mass extinction was brought about. As of 2019, scientists have suggested a number of scenarios to explain the extinction, and each of them would be equally or more plausible. Some of its causes are linked to volcanic activity while others are due to an asteroid impact.

For the end-Triassic extinction, scientists used two possible extinction event scenarios at the time; the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K/T boundary to K-Pg
