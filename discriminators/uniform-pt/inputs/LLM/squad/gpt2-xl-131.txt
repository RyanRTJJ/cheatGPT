) or the first sexual experience (a consensual act and climax of genital pleasure) are considered "adulthood" by some cultures [33].

Sexually dimorphic features, such as gonadal development (the capacity of an individual's testis to produce male (Sertoli) or female (Sertoli-like) sex hormones), sexual behavior, or the presence or absence of sexual harassment, are strongly influenced by these biological and environmental factors [34]. Similarly, psychological traits have been shown to be linked to specific aspects of pubertal development [35].

However, our sample may be atypical because it represents children with ASD who are typically developing. Although not assessed in our study, it has been suggested that other developmental disorders, including intellectual disability, depression, and schizophrenia, can be a proxy for ASD [36]. Similarly, another recent study has demonstrated that individuals with ASD were atypical as preschoolers for aspects of sex hormone function and in the brain [37]. Moreover, sexual behaviors in children with ASD are not likely to differ from that of other children [38].

The specific nature of our study may also bias results for several reasons. One potential reason for our results is that the sample size was relatively small (N = 26). This might have affected the overall proportion of boys per girl in the overall study sample. It is plausible that the gender of the sample at the time of puberty and sexual interest behaviors would not be the same as that currently reported as adult outcomes. In addition, we were able to compare the sex hormones levels of the menarcheal boys to the menarcheal girls because neither gender had been surgically corrected [33]. The age at menarche was determined in girls within the age range studied (11â€“18 years); the age at sexual debut was
