 on Islamic texts will probably never have been written, if ever. This is due to the fact that Sulami wrote three commentaries on the Qur'an (known collectively as The Book on Perfect Wisdom) that remain the most authoritative source of Sufi commentary on the Qur'an. The first, on the opening verses of this work (in Persian Ḥusayn al-Ḥusayn or Surah al-ʿAliya), is a succinct and extremely terse translation on the Qur'anic text that was first used by Ibn al-Qayyad (d. 1036), and then by many other Sufi masters until around the 13th century when a version by Ibn 'Abd al-Barr (d. 1333) was used as the basis for the first, still relatively concise, abridged version by 'Abd al-Baha' al-Sufi (d. 1377), an important master of Sufism and his work is still largely followed today by Sufis.

The Sufi masters who are mostly considered the authoritative sources for Sufism on the Qur'an are the three of Ibn 'Abd al-Barr (d. 1333), Abou Bakr Muhammad Abdul-Rasaq ibn ʿAbdallāh ibn Ja'far Sāqi al-Najmī (d. 1383), and Ibn al-Qasim (d. 1398).

This work on Surah al-ʿAliya was translated into Persian at a date in the late 11th century and became the most influential and authoritative translation of the Qur'anic text by any of its transcribers and remained so until the 13th century and a number of revisions and a number of other new translations are attributed to this period. Ibn al-Qasim's English rendering of this work on Surah al-ʿAliya (Mufrad al-Qasam) also was the main source
