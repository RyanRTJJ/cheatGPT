 emotional expression, sharing of feelings, expressing oneself, and connecting with friends and non-relatives\[[@B1]\]. Peer group support has been shown to reduce substance use and negative peer influence\[[@B2]\].

Peer support from parents has also been recognized as important in adolescents\' prevention of risk behaviors. Adolescents who received social support from their parents demonstrated better behavioral adjustment outcomes in social and emotional areas relative to adolescents receiving only non-parental support\[[@B3]\]. However, it may be difficult for parents to offer peer support. Studies that have involved parent-teacher conferences (PTC) have demonstrated the usefulness of such interventions in developing positive youth development skills as well as reducing substance use and risky behavior\[[@B4]-[@B6]\].

Peer support interventions (PSi) have shown to be effective in reducing substance use of both youth with a history of substance use as well as those being tested for drug or alcohol use. Adolescence is a time when youth can start to develop behaviors that can indicate the development of substance abuse\[[@B7]\]. The potential for peer influence as a risk factor could occur at any stage of the adolescent development process. During adolescence, a high incidence of risk behaviors such as peer problem behaviors, substance use, sex delinquency and sexual activity takes place\[[@B8]\]. Previous studies on adolescent peer influence reported significant adverse consequences from teen dating violence, high-level gang involvement and substance use\[[@B9]\]. This information suggests that peer influence may be a significant risk factor for adolescent substance use.
