At 9:15 the carriers began to bomb the two Japanese battleships; the Japanese high speed destroyers were not even detected until 9:25.

Three minutes into the attack, the destroyer Kaga was badly damaged. Nagumo then moved at high speed and dropped two bombs on the deck of the damaged Kaga. Her captain, Sosei Oishi, was able to make use of his ship's smoke systems to escape.

The carrier was hit by two torpedoes; however, all four battleships took no damage.  Two destroyers which were escorting Nagumo at the time were sunk.  The other battleships were scattered around the carrier, with some being hit by heavy fire, and were later able to leave.
