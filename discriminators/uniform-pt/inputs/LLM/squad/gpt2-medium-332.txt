 in 1866, which had been under French occupation for more than a decade. During this period, Chihuahua was controlled largely by Spanish citizens, who were largely influenced by anti-British sentiment that had arisen in the United States after the American Civil War. Mexican historians have proposed that Brincourt knew this was coming because he had been in the United States for several years and seen the American Revolution firsthand, although he may have simply had the advantage of knowing Chihuahua for a short period of time since his father was the president of the region. As of 1869, Brincourt had taken the position of vice president of Mexico, which gave him a seat on the U.S.-Mexico border council.

After making military preparations, Brincourt marched into Mexico City at the direction of General Antonio de Leon, with a force of nearly 1,400 soldiers, mounted cavalry, and an armed force of about 800 Mexican regulars on horseback. The battle took place at El Tabasco with approximately 14,000 Mexican and American troops in attendance. At this point, Brincourt faced off against a force of 1,100 men and mounted horses. Two days before the actual battle, a coup began and Brincourt was arrested, though his followers survived the coup. By this point he should have been imprisoned for rebellion, yet he escaped with only his wife, son, and wife's maidservant. According to historian Pascual Aguilar, Brincourt "found it necessary to set up the troops he expected to face in order to make room in his command for an army of 5,000 men to serve with him." He sent his army out to assault the Mexican garrison at Juarez to relieve it.

After the battle, some of Brincourt's men tried to storm the town of Santa María, about 100 miles north of Chihuahua, but the soldiers were unable to escape due to heavy Mexican resistance. They eventually moved on the main Mexican military base at Yucatan, which was fortified against guerrilla attacks and used by military operations. Within a few days, Brincourt's forces reached the capital of the State of Michoacán. During this battle, American volunteers armed with rifles were able to capture most of the men and equipment
