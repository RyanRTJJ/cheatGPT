 documents have been written down before in history or whether they have been written down in the present. This statement can be seen as the roots of much of the modern academic field. In my research on modern literary theories, where literary criticism is concerned, these roots can be traced back to the 19th century French philosopher, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis.

Maupertuis’s 18th century French philosophy of the origins of modern science (science du nouveau-sc. d’après-raisonnier) or “natural sciences as based on reason” (nouveau-sci.* dus raisonnier* as ‘nouveau-science”* dus ‘new”) is the origin of a modern approach to literature. This was given its full intellectual expression in another major philosopher in 18th century France, Joseph-François Stival and especially in the form of the literary theory, “The Science of Historical Criticism” (la science* de la critique historique, “Historical Criticism”* de la science) and “The Science of Literature” (la science* de la littérature). Both were given a great deal of attention by French scholars. It was for these reasons that I found it to be of great interest to begin my PhD dissertation about Maupertuis’s development of modern literary theory after reading a number of books that address the topic. This dissertation is the first book of this type in the English language. It gives an excellent introduction to both the beginnings of modern academic literary criticism from 18th century France and to today’s academic literary theory. The book also gives an excellent synthesis of the history of the development of literary criticism for the period from 1700 to the 1930s in the context of French intellectual history with particular focus on the origins of the modernist movement in that time period.

This first chapter gives an extensive overview of the beginnings of academic literary criticism. I will be writing about Maupertuis from a number of different perspectives; a cultural and historical perspective from his own time, a historicist perspective from his predecessor, Jules Bonaparte, followed
