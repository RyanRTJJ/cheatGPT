 nature of its interfaces, and that the Start screen looked too similar to the OneNote interface. But many users and critics thought the new interface was a better one than previous versions.

The new software features include a "Metro tile" approach to Windows 10, in which apps can live in one tile and then spread out across multiple tiles. For example, a music player in a tile could be more visible than a program that plays podcasts. Metro also replaces the start-up-like Start menu and gives users a clean desktop experience. OneDrive files, which are downloaded to the device, can be added to Start, without any need for a program.

One feature Microsoft did not detail is support for 4K and HDR content.

The apps for the update include Skype, OneDrive, Outlook, Xbox Music and Skype for Business. Windows has made a new version of the Office suite available, and Microsoft's Surface Hub, as well as Skype for Business Client and Bing Search. Other Windows apps include a new Metro Control Panel and Skype for Business integration. There is also a new photo-editing app called Sketch Builder, as well as a new Skype Translator app.

Microsoft is promising the Windows 10 update will be free.
