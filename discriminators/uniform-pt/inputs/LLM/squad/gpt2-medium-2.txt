The Bush administration was confident that the invasion of Iraq would prove successful, but the failure of that invasion led to another war over the next several years. In the aftermath of the invasion, there was widespread criticism by the United Nations of the Bush administration's war efforts.

In late 1993, US Secretary of State William Ruckelshaus announced the U.S. would withdraw from Iraq at the end of 1996, having provided support to the Iraqi insurgency that had launched the country's bloody civil war of the early 1990s.

In March of the following year, the US announced that it would have
