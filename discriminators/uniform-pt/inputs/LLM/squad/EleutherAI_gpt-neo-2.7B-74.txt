 weight in a number of metals as defined in Appendix A of the Coinage Act of September 14, 1935[@b1]. This Act was originally passed by the Joint Committee onCoinage of the United States House of Representatives and the Senate in December 1934[@b2]. The coinage act is the legal basis for coin manufacturing and the regulation of gold and the value of the unit of measure. The unit of currency is the U.S. dollar and is made up of one hundred twenty four (124) distinct units of value called   denarii   [@b1].

Gold coins were introduced on October 7, 1792[@b3], and issued by Congress on May 16, 1793. During the period of introduction about 500 coins or half dollars (4 ounces) in number were issued. However by the end of the 1800s the supply of coins had decreased significantly due to the fact that the mint was controlled by a single individual, the U.S. Treasurer. Since there was no central mint, as is the case today, the coinage was made by minting private, self-financed coins, a fact which led to the devaluation of the dollar in the early 1900s[@b1]. It was only in the late 1800s and early 1900s that the coins were produced and minted by independent mints[@b3]. A total of thirty one billion six hundred seventy seventy five million (2,736,775,000) gold dollars were minted. These coins were all produced from the same design (the obverse) by three independent gold mints and are sometimes referred to as Gold Eagles. The coins were then produced into different weight denominations called 1 ounce, 2 ounces, etc. There were five different types of gold dollar coins: gold dollars, silver dollars, silver cents and half dollars. The gold silver and half dollar coins were produced in a smaller quantity than the gold dollars and were commonly referred to as bullion dollars. A total of four billion half dollars were made between 1870 and 1914[@b1].

The gold coins were introduced by Congress in two bills signed by President
