 million U.S. consumers had an elevator within their homes. If it's safe, it'll be safe, right?

If it's safe, we don't need to use elevators in public. The majority of Americans don't rely on elevators in their homes. You don't own elevators and you don't need them every day. That seems to be an increasingly common view among a growing population as the majority of millennials and others turn to computers for more flexibility. People are often happy to work with computers when not in use, or working more hours for that matter.

It's time that public safety should be the primary focus of transportation investments, not just something we may not have previously gotten through legislative appropriations.
