), and the only one with no day without measurable wind (on April 7 - which was not one of their typical "no wind days").

Winds are often the cause of delays, so St. John's is often at the top of the list for slowest transit commutes.

On the rare occasion when the wind doesn't keep St. John's transit moving, there are ways to mitigate the impact. For instance, the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, which provides policing services to the Halifax area, has the "Pray for Transit" page on Facebook. So has the St. John's fire department, which is based in the city and is "well known to have a lot of firefighters who would rather get out of the house and on the bus to keep St. John's busy."

And for those who want a little extra time off, there's always the ferry (free during the summer, as noted above) or the Halifax airport (airport-wide transit passes are $28.75).

The "no wind" tag seems to be spreading, too: While not recorded in the previous version of this geography quiz, there are now four non-day with no wind recorded in the most recent full 12-month period:

St. John's — 74 days

Winnipeg — 73 days

Winnipeg — 72 days

Halifax — 70 days

Toronto — 67 days

One of the challenges of conducting a long-form survey is that answering each question takes a lot of time and the most frequent response may not be the best indicator of the entire data set. The same can also be said for the number of days without measurable wind, which is measured with a stopwatch at a local bar, and not an instrument on a weather map. When we ran multiple versions of the geography quiz with varying degrees of time-period variation in
