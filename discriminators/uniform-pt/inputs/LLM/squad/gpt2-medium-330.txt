The Kansas City Chiefs have one of the longest tenured names in KU's history. They are coached by Tom Osborne, who served in KU's basketball program from 1999 to 2005. He has played the past three years for the Kansas City Royals and will serve his second full year in Kansas. He has led his team to the Kansas City Bowl Championship Series and the Kansas City Opens, leading with eight straight victories from 2005 to 2007. The Chiefs reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Championships twice since the 1990-1991 season with a 17-9 record. That season, the team went 10-1 and entered the tournament with the automatic bid. The 2001 Royals won their second straight Big 12 title and came back for the 2004 edition.

In addition to Osborne, the Jayhawks' roster features an all-time leading shooting guard in Karl Malone (973 career 3s), a former collegiate All-American (2008-11) who averaged 18.4 points and 7.3 assists. The Kansas City Chiefs ranked 15th in points per game allowed by an opponent in their final season of operation in 1999-2000 and in the Big 12 the past two years, the Chiefs have struggled against West Coast teams this season.
