 a priest, like the bishop, was a figure of divine law and as such was charged to be celibate. In this state, he alone was permitted to consecrate persons for heavenly glory. The priesthood was the source of a state of grace and a symbol of the Kingdom of God.

This continued until the Second Vatican Council separated the priesthood from the state and the pope from the clergy.

The Roman Catholic Church regards itself not only as a Christian religion or ecclesial form of Christianity but also as the apostolic Church, which has a special identity and continuity. In accordance with the apostolic character of the Church, a constant succession of popes has governed for all time. A pope is the spiritual successor of Peter whom all the apostles ordained, who was the first bishop of the Church.

The papas are the bishops who carry out the apostolic mission of the Roman Church. They are charged with maintaining the dignity and authority of the pope while exercising the authority of their own presbyterates - ecclesial groups within a diocese. They must be of Roman and Catholic faithful. The pope is the supreme judge in Church matters but the Roman Catholic clergy is a hierarchical community in the full sense of the word. As priests, they are responsible to the diaconate through obedience to the Bishop. They serve in their own diocese and at the head of their own parishioners.
