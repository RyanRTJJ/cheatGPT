 System that uses two solar panels on top of an evaporator and a water heat exchanger to condense water for irrigation in remote areas. These reflectors are on show at the 2012 International Photovoltaic Congress in Stockholm. Other solar condensers and solar condenser systems are working in schools and other education facilities under the supervision of University of Toronto Professor David Kowalski who started the UTM team in 2008.

A solar reflector is made of a sheet of material that extends from the front of the dish to approximately 45 cm below the ground. When electricity is applied, one of the panels is lowered to the ground and reflected by the evaporation of water from the evaporation chamber and reflected back onto the reflector. When sunlight hits the reflective sheet, which may be over 700 cm above the ground, the reflected sun rays reflect sunlight onto the reflective surface where a series of semiconductor-coated mirrors provide visible light. A single, reflective solar reflector on top of the evaporator is less reflective than several thousands of other reflectors but can be much more durable.

The energy of sunlight is captured by the semiconductor conductors and converted into electrical energy by the crystalline lattice of the reflectors. These reflectors can be placed above or beneath an evaporator so water evaporates over them to dissipate the energy (light) from sunlight and convert it back into light. This is more efficient than a traditional mechanical way of concentrating solar energy because one of the main reasons
