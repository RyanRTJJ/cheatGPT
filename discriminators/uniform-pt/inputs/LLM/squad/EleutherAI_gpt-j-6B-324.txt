 of a predator will be higher when it is less abundant. The increase in its population can be attributed to the fact that if an individual does not have to compete for food, it will be capable of producing more offspring. The consequence of this is that the fitness of those offspring will be higher, and thus the predators population can also be high.



This increased fitness is reflected as it also translates to better survival chances for the offspring. In a given time period, if an individual is able to survive and reproduce when there are less predators, it will have better genes.



Predators such as wolves are able to survive off an alternate food source, making up for the population decrease as their prey becomes more vulnerable to wolves. If a wolf is able to go through a period of time without feeding off its prey, then it is able to consume an additional food source, and reproduce its numbers.



However, even if wolves survive better than their prey, the overall population is going to go down. The reasons are two-fold: First, there is a natural balance in nature, and the population level of the prey is supposed to be lower than the predator, meaning that the prey is able to control the amount of the predator numbers.



Second, we see the fact that as the population decreases, predators will look for other animals to prey off of. This leads to their population increase. In return for this increased population, the predator population decreases



The reason why wolves can control other populations is not through their numbers, but simply through their behaviour. Their instinctual behaviors such as scavenging, as well as the packs living in nature,
