i also pointed to the fact that Arab societies have historically associated a degree with higher education—a fact that makes this a point of contrast to Islamic Europe. He points to the fact that many European nations (such as France, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) have developed their national universities based on the degree system developed by the Muslim Ottoman Empire, whereas Islamic Europe has not made use of this system because the Muslim Ottoman empire collapsed. If the notion of degrees being the key to a university education in Europe is correct, then the Muslim Ottoman empire cannot be seen as a model.

Makdisi argues that it is therefore illogical for Europeans to claim that Muslim Europe is not influenced by Islam. He says that the Islamic West is merely mimicking Islamic culture from the Middle East where, in addition to the Islamic madrasa, there are also university systems based on the degrees. He also points out that Islam doesn't force anyone to study it, thus eliminating the stigma that exists today when talking about the European degree.

Makdisi further points out that this claim contradicts the Muslim belief that Islam is the only source of morality. Many Muslim intellectuals, he points out, feel more comfortable with the traditional morality of an Islamic way of life than he does with a modern idea of morality. He also makes the point that the Islamic World viewed the degrees (such as the dolāl, shaḥīj, and alīgāth) as an extension of their religion and did not allow them to be taken away from their religious duties in the modern world.
