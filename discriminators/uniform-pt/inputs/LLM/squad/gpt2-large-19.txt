In 1990 White Stripes' 'Rope' debuted at number one, as did their self-titled follow-up, which would go on to sell over 16 million copies, making it by far the biggest and most successful music album of the 1990s.

Others believed that it was the music's cultural importance that had driven the UK's pop charts to the top, and that the album had become too commercial
