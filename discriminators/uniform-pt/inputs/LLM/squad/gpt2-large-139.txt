 not invasions, except when they are clearly identified as such.

As indicated in the introduction, the Roman Empire expanded northwards from the Danube River in Africa to Ireland and southward to the continent of Europe where it acquired and preserved its political and cultural character. The central Mediterranean and West African provinces became main centers of Rome and the empire. This area was a very important center of trade, politics, culture, and science. However, the central Mediterranean was not considered to be a "Roman" state by many people. People called themselves Romans, i.e. "ruled the world". In fact, that was not correct. While the Roman rulers may have governed the world, they were not necessarily part of the "Roman" world. Some Roman rulers established state and civic institutions all over the Mediterranean region. These included Carthage, Carthaginian rule in Italy, and Rome as a state in Gaul (north-western Europe). In contrast to the southern Mediterranean area, where they were treated more generously by the Greeks and the Arabs, the Roman provinces in the northern Mediterranean were treated very harshly by the Roman Empire. They were subjected to harsh rulers who had been raised to high political prominence by this Empire. These rulers used their power as conquerors to impose their own political (rather than military) system and customs over the provinces, but were not able to rule them. In short, the political and cultural culture of the provinces was not a result of Roman rule, but of the natural processes of development.
