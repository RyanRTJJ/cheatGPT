sein went. It appears that, for better or worse, this was Athanasius' route into and out of Roman territory. Athanasius is generally credited with writing the first book of Christian apologetics in the second century, but this claim is disputed (for more information see Paul Anderson and James Rummel, The Apostolic Tradition). According to Athanasius, his mission consisted of the "counsel of the Gentiles" (sorbon hominis) and the first Christian "teaching" (i.e. the New Testament). The word "teaching" is translated "counsel" by the author of the writings (and many apocryphal texts) written by Athanasius. In his first work written from Carthage (A.D. 70-74), Athanasius' 'Teaching the Christians' (sorbon hosne), he sets the basis for the later New Testament writings, such as New Testament of Mark, Gospel of Mark (probably after AD 50), Gospel of Luke (possibly after AD 150), Gospel of John (possibly after AD 180), Gospel of the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles of Paul, Epistle to the Hebrews, Wisdom of Solomon, Sentences of Paul, Letters of Paul, Letters of Paul to Ephesians (or perhaps Ephesians with 'The Teaching of Truth': that was written post AD 170). It is possible that Athanasius' 'Teaching the Christians' was indeed based around a few preachers and one in particular, but it was not written by this person, Athanasius, however. He was in Rome for some time, and there is not certainty as to whether he lived there as well. In addition, his writings may be the work of many preachers, who lived and worked in Rome, including Cyril of Jerusalem; Polycarp; Eustathius, Epiphanius; Irenaeus; Ephrem the Syrian. In any case, his work was written during the second first century, shortly before the Councils of Ephesus, Chalcedon and Constance.
