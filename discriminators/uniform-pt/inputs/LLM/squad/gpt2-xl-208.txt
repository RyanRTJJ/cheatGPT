When the ball goes beyond the 40-yard line in full play, the ball is dead; a penalty kick is taken to decide the match result. The rules of football allow the use of a ball-juggling rule called the halyard on the goal. Instead of a standard three-point stance, half-backs must position themselves behind the center and half-right flank of the field. During each tackle, such as tackle-end, the tackle end is positioned behind and to the right, directly over the ball carrier. In a match between Canada and Mexico, the Canadian side will face each quarter of the field twice. Depending upon the opponent, the player from each province will face the other half once, once by a quarter-back or forward, and once by a half-back or forward. The player from each province will then face the other quarter of the field once, again by a quarter-back or forward, if the Canadian side scores. If the Canadian team scores, their half-back or player will tackle the player from the Mexican side on the half-yard line. The opposing team then takes the ball from the player they're tackled by and attempts to win in a touchdown.
