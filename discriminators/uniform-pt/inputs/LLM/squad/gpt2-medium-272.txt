ers that were designed prior to the typewriter's introduction. Some of the characters that were changed were placed in a particular order around them on the typewriter for ease of understanding when reading the word.


The typewriter was not made from scratch but evolved very carefully over many years while the typewriter was still in development by mechanical typewriter-manufacturer Stanley A. Larkin in 1868, who was known for his attention to detail and reliability. On this typewriter, there were many different types of parts (including springs, countersunk and spring-type), and many of these parts were changed, such as spring-type countersunk typing keyboards and non-spaced keys, as well as keys that may have been made with spring type but whose design was based on the spring-type typewriter. We also have typewriter keyboards with "slotted keys" which were designed to be used on the backside of the typewriter with small (less than 1/32 inch thick) brass keys. These slotted keys, which can be used for a variety of functions including the "press" key on the keyboard, are described in further detail below. Some of the different parts of the typewriter typewriter and corresponding letters were manufactured by other companies or factories, but there are still a few known to us. So, if you have a copy of a "C", for example, or a "I," you can be sure we have a copy of these different typewriter types and correspondences with the typewriter itself. Although we believe typewriter typewriters were once manufactured on a very wide scale, we have collected information on only a few major companies that manufactured typewriters until the late 1950s.
