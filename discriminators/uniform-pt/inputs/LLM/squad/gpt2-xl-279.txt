also called a "plummet"). This plough was attached to the top of the third rail (at street level). The current was used to run the tram and power the electrical system.

A conductor (a person in control of a cable) guided the tram or cable along a track. The electrical current passed through conduits on the inside of the track and out into the street below.

In 1920, the City of Toronto added electrification to streetcars by replacing all cars with electric vehicles. The cable was replaced with wires, and the conduits were located inside the cars. The streetcar would use the third rail for electrical current and the street would use the street.

Current in streetcars was passed through the wires at the bottom of the third rail under street level. The cables at street level were suspended over one or more streets with a pulley system. The pulley system would bring the cables to the streetcar and then the wires to street level.

In 1925, the streetcar companies began to operate their transit vehicles without third-rail current collection. Electric vehicles were replaced by steam-powered vehicles and all streetcars were electrically powered. The conduit system was removed and electricity was used to power all vehicles.

Electrification of streetcars

Before 1923, streetcars had electrification in two stages: streetcar current generation and transmission to the street.

The First Stage: Current generation and transmission

The City of Toronto contracted with the North York Railway Company (NYR) to collect and use third-rail current from electricity mains under Toronto. The NYR's current collection equipment was located in the Toronto Street Railway Company's Toronto Yard. The Toronto Street Railway Company's electrical generating facilities were in the Toronto Harbour Yard. The streetcars were towed into the yard
