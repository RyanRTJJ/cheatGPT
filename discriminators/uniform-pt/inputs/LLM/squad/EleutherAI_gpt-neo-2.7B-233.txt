.e., they promote the formation of one or more free radicals) and their production of reactive oxygen species (“ROS”) is the most common mechanism of toxicity of most drugs (or other toxic compounds that promote the formation of free radicals) and chemicals (e.g., reactive oxygen (ROS) forming oxidizers) ([1-3]).
The damage caused by ROS is primarily caused by an increase in the quantity of free radicals produced. ROS can cause oxidation damage by affecting the nucleotide bases, nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids in cells and/or by attacking DNA leading to DNA strand breaks. Furthermore, when mitochondria (mitochondrion is the site of aerobic respiration where carbohydrates are utilized as an energy source, and for energy production via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) or via anaerobic respiration (anaerobic respiration is not an active biological process and is more associated with the anaerobic metabolism of certain bacterial anaerobes, including the anaerobic, microaerophilic, and aerophilic bacteria and anerobic, anaerobic molds (i.e., aerobic respiration).
During oxidative stress (caused by ROS or otherwise) there is a release of the metal ions Fe2+ that is catalyzed by the Fenton reaction ([4]), and Fe3+. The Fenton reaction is a chemical reaction that produces hydroxyl radicals through H2O2 (an ROS) and the interaction of Fe2+ and H2O2 that produces the hydroxyl ion (OH−). At this site, the Fenton reaction produces OH− and Fe3+. In a manner similar to the oxidative damage of DNA, hydroxyl radicals are very reactive chemicals. They are characterized by
