 time that Eisenhower appeared to accept the idea, although he subsequently retracted, in the face of widespread Republican opposition. 

In March 1952, Eisenhower announced his intentions to run for president and became the Republican nominee for the office. The 1952 presidential election saw Eisenhower as the overwhelming favorite in the polls, ultimately beating his Democratic opponent, Adlai Stevenson, by a wide margin in order to take the White House. 

The Eisenhower Presidency (1953-1961) was an era of conservative domestic and international policies, government fiscal restraint, and increased economic prosperity. During his time in the Oval Office, Eisenhower cold-warred the Soviet Union and other communist nations which threatened to increase their military presence and spread their mode of government. In the domestic political arena, he launched ambitious projects to construct the interstate highway system, cleaved unnecessary bureaucracy, and kept in check the growth of labor unions. His most significant international accomplishment was securing the peace between Israel, Egypt and Syria.
