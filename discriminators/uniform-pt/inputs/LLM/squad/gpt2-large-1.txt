 Belgrade Declaration, an inter-ethnic, non-sectarian document. This document was aimed at promoting tolerance and reconciliation between the various peoples of the Balkans. To mark the declaration, which was produced as a result of a conference in Novi Belgrade in January 1955, Serbian President, Todor Milosevic, visited in Yugoslavia the Serbian literary institutions of Ljubljana and Sisak. One of the aims of Milosevic's visit was the establishment of a literature school in Vršlovo (formerly called Zlatovinje). This had to provide training in the Serbian literature that was not at the time on the literary mainstream in the country at the time, but which had, nevertheless, come back to prominence due to the Yugoslav and Serbian literature.

Vladimir Matica Srpska was an extremely important participant in this work as he published the Serbian edition of his first book: Tashkent – the city of the gods. The publication of Matica Srpska in 1956 was one of the first indications of the importance of the Serbian literary scene. He was invited to Serbia a second time in 1968, but due to personal reasons declined. A year later, a conference between Serbian intellectuals and other experts was organized and they adopted the following statement:

"It is impossible for us to live in this period in our country any longer without some kind of literary and cultural exchange"

In 1969, Matica Srpska moved to France, and stayed in Paris until his death in 1979.

In 1992, when the Yugoslav republic was still called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the first literary festival of the Republic of Serbia took place in Velika Strana, in the heart of the city of Novi Nikolaevo.


The Serbian literary scene in the mid to late 1970's was highly developed.


The year 1971 was marked by the publication of Pravič (19),
