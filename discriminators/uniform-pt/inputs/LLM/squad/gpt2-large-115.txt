ppella music used vocal harmony and solo instruments, while later works such as that of Gertrude, one of the most prominent a cappella artists, were full of solo instruments.

In the 1750s, the Scottish Edwardian-era work of the 19th-century Canadian composer Andrew Williams was hailed as the first truly a cappella music, and the work won more awards than any other a cappella composer of his time. However, the early a cappella movement was mostly performed with instrumentation alone, and some composers used only voice for their a cappellas.

But by the middle of the 18th century the British writer and composer Thomas Hardy became something of the godfather of the early a cappella movement, using piano, organ, bassoon, violin and other instruments. He wrote over 100 a cappella songs, which were recorded by some of the leading a cappella players of the period such as Adam Ash and Thedford and Thomas Wilson.

As in the early history of classical music, most early a cappella compositions were sung to the accompaniment of a male and female orchestra on three tracks, as in a popular hymn or a piece of verse (or a combination of it).

In the 1810s and 1830s, several other composers and music teachers, including John Haydon Hall and George Meredith, were using music that combined music that combined vocal and instrumental parts (in classical terms) into one.

In the mid-1830s, three new a cappella composers, including Isaac Haydn, Richard Wagner's son, and the 1835-1746 composer Frederick von Hohenheim, all used a mixture of vocal and instrumental parts.

In 1844, the German composer Gustav Mahler, the first modern German composer, wrote an essay in which he discussed the "a cappella" technique. Mahler suggested that if the instrumentation was kept relatively simple - that is, if the music was only used to the accompaniment of a solo cello
