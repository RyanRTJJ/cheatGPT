 energy that each particle generates. It was a mathematical equation whose simplest formula was the ratio of the spin spin-flip ratio to the energy of the system. (See The History of Cosmology.) If the spin was in any way different from the rest of the particle, he could measure the spin-flip ratio and determine the particle's energy. (For more on this topic, see Feynman's "The Physical Limits of Quantum Theory.") At the same time, though, he could also calculate the spin's orientation. The orientation could be in any direction, because the two spins were mirror images.

So Feynman found the angle at which matter and antimatter could be viewed as if from the same viewpoint. In fact, he could see particles going out to sea and particle that had been traveling backwards, in the mirror image. If he also observed antiparticles going to sea, he could calculate that they had gone backwards by an angle of 12 degrees.

Feynman figured that if antiparticles had ever been found, they would not be antiprotons with a mass of 2.7 millimeters but protons with mass 0.4 millimeters. (They also would not be charged, but as antimatter, although they would not have much mass, they would still be in charge.) Thus, he could see a set of particles, like the light shown on the right and the dark lines, as if they were two light beams separated by a distance of 4.23 meters: one with a positive charge and one with a negative charge.

If, on the other hand, matter particles
