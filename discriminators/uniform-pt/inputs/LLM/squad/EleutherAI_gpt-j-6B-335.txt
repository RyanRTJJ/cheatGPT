, Ashkenazi Ashkenazim showed no evidence of increased inbreeding, while Sephardim, Mizrahim, Ethiopians, and North Africans carried evidence of consanguinity within specific tribes [@pone.0044277-Bray1]. This study also found that Ashkenazi Jews show higher genetic heterogeneity compared to any of those populations studied. It also suggested that high intra-tribal sub-structure in Ashkenazi Jews was possibly generated by inbreeding within relatively recent historical periods in Eastern Europe and Middle East.

In the present study, we used the combined haplogroup A subclade of mtDNAs to evaluate relationships of Jewish samples with those of the worldwide population. Our results showed a lower haplotype diversity within the Ashkenazi Jews, as compared to the other world populations, indicating genetic homogeneity.

When we examined the Jewish haplogroup A subclades, we found that the Ashkenazi had a relatively homogenous haplogroup A population, with haplogroups U6b3 and L3h3a having predominant frequencies of 0.81 and 0.04 respectively. However, haplotype U3h had a relatively high frequency of 0.24 in Ashkenazi samples.

As for the Sephardim and North Africans, the most frequent haplogroup was U3c2d1 (47% and 48% vs. 26% in Ashkenazi Jews), indicating that the two populations shared common ancestors in the ancient Middle East. One important finding in the Sephardim/North Africans in the present study was the presence of some haplogroup U3c variants, which were not found in Ashkenazi. A study by Ben-El et al. [@pone.0044277-BenEl1] estimated that haplogroup U3c was of Neolithic origin, and suggested that it might have been derived from a northern Europe-Iranian or central European population, which could also possibly account for the Ashkenazi
