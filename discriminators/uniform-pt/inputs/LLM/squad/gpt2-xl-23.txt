 the standard PS4 would be out of production by the end of 2014. Both systems would be available in 60Hz 1080p, 8GB RAM models.

It has been rumored for a while that the company was planning to introduce a cheaper, thinner PS4, but Sony has remained silent on the subject.

So what exactly do these latest rumors add up to? Well, it looks like Sony is putting the finishing touches on a smaller, yet still relatively powerful PS4. If rumors are true, the new PS4 would reportedly be 4GB in size (the current design is rumored to have 8GB), have less powerful hardware compared to other mid-grade systems, and would not be priced anywhere near the $350 price tag for the current model.

The smaller machine could also feature less powerful CPU performance compared to the last-gen PS4. The GPU for Sony's new PS4 would likely take up around 40 percent of the total CPU workload, according to a recent report on Videocardz (and verified by CNET). That would likely make the PS4's GPU a fairly average GPU and leave some GPU resources devoted to game logic.

If the speculation about Sony's new, slimmer console is correct, don't expect the Sony PS4 to enter production before 2015. As always, Sony declined to comment.
