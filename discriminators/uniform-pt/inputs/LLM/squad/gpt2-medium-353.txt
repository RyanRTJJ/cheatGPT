 its campuses, which has a racial makeup almost entirely black.

The former administration, which is under contract to the University of California, in part thanks to pledges from college president John C. Calhoun Jr., also was under fire for not addressing the problem of police brutality before it became public.

Calhoun College's president said the school faced criticism for its lack of action in the aftermath of the school shooting in Charleston in 2015.
