 rappers to admit that they had no idea what they were talking about when they began making music together. These efforts and many others have also been credited to the fact that his fans are aware of a lot more than just his songwriting skills. In the days leading up to 2016 with Giggles, there has been a lot of talk of his being a fan of Kanye West, but that's not really true. A lot of people who heard the following tweets have mentioned his fans, but if his fans have actually been around for years, I think the most definitive way to understand his fans, is still knowing which rappers in their midst had their own views of Kanye:

"Drew Giggles, I hope he isn't too late. He is so fucking good that I had to ask him to do a bit of a remix. His name is @kanye_west but it was great to get this track in the mix. He is a beautiful character and has so much confidence. If they don't like him, or if he feels we're too loud or don't have the right feel for the song, he's fine with that. His fans love him. They would like to know what Kanye was thinking. He has been in such an incredible funk in the past that it's so cool he just doesn't really do his thing. I think there's a growing amount of people who say "fuck you, I have nothing to say and his fans love a song like that." He is a beautiful person, he can talk. It's very cool that we're all like you.
