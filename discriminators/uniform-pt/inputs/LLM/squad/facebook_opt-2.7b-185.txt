 an artificial boundary on interactions with another person (e.g., a spouse).

Such barriers often generate hostility between individuals, leading to negative consequences for society as a whole. Therefore, it is important to understand which social relationships are exclusive, which are inclusive, and how we might alter social relations to make inclusive relationships more likely.

How do I know if I’m in an exclusive or inclusive relationship?

The following are the characteristics of different types of exclusive and inclusive relationships.

Exclusive relationships:

You can’t get someone else’s opinion when talking to the person.

The boundaries are enforced by a person making a decision.

The decision can be ignored if the decision-maker or a group of other people says “no” to the boundary.

The decision-maker or a group of other people can tell you what to do.

The decision is final.

No one else is allowed to communicate the decision to another person, group, community, or society.

Exclusive relationships are based on strong emotions and emotional attachment, often involving a strong romantic relationship. It may be difficult to form an inclusive relationship based on these same criteria.

Inclusive relationships:

You and the other person can express your opinions when talking to the person.

There is no decision-making involved in establishing or enforcing boundaries.

The decision-maker or a group of other people can ask another person to agree to a boundary.

The decision-maker can’t tell you what to do.

The decision will be revisited if it’s changed.

You can have additional opinions shared with you.

You and the other person can share perspectives with other people
