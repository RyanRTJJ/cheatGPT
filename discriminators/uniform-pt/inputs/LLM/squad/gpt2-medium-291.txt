 texts of the Greeks, the Romans, and the Byzantine period in general. For Virgil's audience, this radical change brought a new level of abstraction to the language and created a new ideal of literature as something to be experienced, discussed, and learned. The most notable and well-written of the classical Gospels, for example, is Matthew, which is divided into six parts. The first part, the first chapter of the Gospel of Matthew (Epistles), is written in Greek only, as all of the other Gospels in this canon are, and is known as the Nicene Fathers. The other two portions, the "First" and "Second Epistle" (chaplets), consist entirely of German, containing not only a new composition and an extended translation of the original Greek, but also the Epistle of Barnabas; a major milestone in the development of the New Testament. Although there are minor differences - for example, in the first century the Gospels were divided into three or four chapters, and at a later time in order not to interfere with their original work, the Second Gospel also had only one chapter - this Epistle to Tethys - but this is also the oldest extant Gospel of the New Testament, and thus offers a valuable insight into how the Church thought about its own tradition and its role in society. The Epistles of St. Paul are the most significant as they establish his role as the second coming of Jesus Christ, and hence a prelude to the coming of his second coming. These stories of his life and ministry, of his conversion, and his ascension into heaven are the core of the New Testament tradition and are written from the perspective of St. Peter, the author of Revelation who comes to preach the Gospel of Jesus, although we should distinguish between "the Revelation of Peter" and "the revelation of Peter."
