Polytechnics, also called institutes of technology, (sometimes also called lyceums), consist of four main elements—the faculty with specific subject area and specialization, with teaching staff and other academic staff and students, the institution which owns the land and buildings in the place of the subject of teaching and the student’s body associated to the faculty of specialty.
