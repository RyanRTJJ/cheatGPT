 albums chart in its first week. It was later certified 6x Platinum by the RIAA. Despite the critical and financial success of the album, the album became Beyoncé’s least commercially successful since her fifth studio album, “I Am… Sasha Fierce,” which only managed to reach number four on the charts before the release of “Irreplaceable.” The album’s physical album sales were slightly below her previous four studio albums’s sales. In its first week, “Beyoncé” sold over four million copies, making it one of the best-selling albums of 2013 and the topselling album of 2013 at the retail level. The album is the fifteenth best-selling album of all time in the United States, and the third best-selling album of 2013, as well as the ninth best-selling album of the 2000s decade, with over 6 million in sales to date. Beyoncé was ranked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100. As a result of its immense commercial success, “Beyoncé” was the eleventh best-selling album of 2013 in the United States. “Beyoncé” sold over 4.6 million copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan, a record for Beyoncé. The album also sold almost four million copies abroad. In Japan, “Beyoncé” sold over 875,000 copies on its first week of release alone, becoming the best-selling album of 2013 there, becoming the eighth best-selling overall of 2013, and becoming the best-selling album by an Arab artist since 2005.
