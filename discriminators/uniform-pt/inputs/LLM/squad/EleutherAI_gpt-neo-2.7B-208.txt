 of play. Each team has 21 minutes in which to complete six sets of 25 passes. This is usually in the following sequence: 4, 3, 2, 1, 11, 5, 6, 3, 13.

The player who has achieved the most points during the final quarter of each half, known as the winning team's "half time score", is declared the winner, the score of the other team is the losing final score and both teams receive the same score, i.e. the score of two losing players. After a match is over, a "full time score" is agreed using the same method. Before a break, a 10-point conversion from the losing team must be made before each full time score is recorded as a win for the team who did not make the conversion. Any team that makes an incorrect conversion is automatically taken score and given a full time score. If there is a draw after both teams have scored, the score of the draw ends up as two equally-scorable halves.

Most referees (officiating bodies that adjudicate in the game), and more specifically officials at the senior level (with a significant number of international and club referees having the privilege to officiate at the senior level), use a scoring system based on a "rolling dead time" of 55 minutes, a minimum time of 30 minutes between quarters and the standard "half time score". However, under FIFA criteria the starting time of a match and the end time of a match are determined by the referee
