 time that Eisenhower admitted during an interview for Time magazine that he was considering a second run for the presidency. Shortly thereafter, on June 27, 1952, shortly before the California primary, Eisenhower told a radio interviewer that if he had the chance to get back in the presidential race in 1952, he would declare himself a Democrat. In December, Eisenhower wrote in his autobiography that while he would be interested in being President, he preferred to be involved "in the business of doing something about the country and the world" first, and that his goal was also to have a "great national discussion about the problems of the day."[20]

In March 1953, Eisenhower declared that he would not seek the presidency again. He said his political interests were in the business world.

Eisenhower continued his life as a private citizen, working for General Motors.[21][22][23] In 1953, the CIA had to deny that Eisenhower gave a major speech in Washington, D.C., at an American automobile industry meeting. However, the speech and transcript were declassified in 2008 and made public,[24] indicating that he did give the speech.

Eisenhower died on April 14, 1962 in Washington, D.C. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
