 now "an academy model school". [7]

According to the Times Educational Supplement (25th September 2017): A pupil is one in five of the 1,800 students which makes Eton one of the lowest-receive-fees school types in the country... The highest receive fee comes from £60,000 to £73,000 at Harrow and another fee comes from £50,000 to £73,000 at Westminster or £45,000 to £52,000 at Millfield. The lowest is Eton where the received fee for fees is around £27,000.[8]

Eton’s Head of Academics has said that the school has "a reputation for a very high standard of academic achievement" and also pointed out that over 60% of pupils receive some kind of scholarship. He also pointed out that all schools have some form of fees. He added: “We are grateful to our sponsors for their trust in and support of Eton. The fees we receive enable the Academy to continue a strong curriculum and high academic standards for all our students… We are very conscious that the fees we receive are not a huge contribution to our overall budget, but for thousands of boys it represents a significant increase in their funding for their time at our Academy.
