 which occurs during adolescence), as an indicator of adulthood, may be considered to be the last menses the female was able to have during her sexual maturation (Dallenbach, [@CR19]). In the Western culture, menarche is commonly defined as the period of time between the ages of 13 and 18 years (Gudin, [@CR44]). The transition into adulthood is a continuous process with stages leading to eventual physical, emotional, social, and psychological maturation (Gudin, [@CR43], [@CR45]). The end of adolescence in the Western culture occurs when a person reaches the age of 18---the age of adulthood as defined by most Western cultures (<http://adults.who.int/topics/overview/en/childhood/who-adults>). The end of adolescence commonly occurs between ages of 14 and 16 years with the majority of adolescents starting their first period of sexual activity around age 12--13 (Dallenbach, [@CR19]). There is no consensus in the scientific literature as to how long adolescents should wait before having periods of unprotected intercourse before a pregnancy occurs. Some sources propose it should not be delayed beyond age 17 (Greenwood, [@CR42]; Kopp, [@CR59]; Papanas, [@CR72]). However, several studies have recommended delaying the initiation of sexual activity, regardless of the age at which the adolescent initiates the sexual contact (Buchholz et al., [@CR14]; Miretto et al., [@CR70]; Pertierra et al., [@CR75]). While it is agreed that delaying initiation of protected vaginal or oral sex for the child is an effective method in delaying the development of sexual disorders (Greenwood, [@CR42]), evidence of the effectiveness of delaying these activities is still lacking. There are several reasons why delaying initiation of these sexual activities may be successful. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), hormonal changes that occur during adolescence and pregnancy are the most common etiologies of negative sexual experience and its
