This makes software vulnerable to security flaws, and is not recommended. While the software behind Windows will generally not be directly vulnerable to the weaknesses of a single rogue kernel, the security of the rest of the operating system will, making it easy for malicious code to be executed. As a result, with Windows 8 becoming the standard operating system for personal devices around the world, the practice of requiring secure boot had to be abandoned. The requirement was a way to discourage manufacturers from putting their devices at risk if they preferred not to enforce the security of their system.

This move has caused some controversy, in part due to a perceived lack of transparency from Redmond. In addition to announcing the switch, Microsoft released Windows 8's source code; an unprecedented move if ever implemented for a software product. These decisions will prove controversial in the software community for another reason: while some supporters of the move are pleased, the development of any new operating system would face additional constraints once source code is released. As a result, a number of questions have arisen regarding the security of Windows 8: is this the final nail in
