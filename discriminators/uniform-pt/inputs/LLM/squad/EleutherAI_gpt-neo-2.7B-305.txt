. This activity, however, is far from free from human intervention. By nature, every human being on this planet is an omnivore, consuming a wide range of animal products. Thus, the domestication of animals has taken place not just by humans, but also by a variety of different animal species. In most cases, domestication was a gradual and step-by-step process. In other words, there was no sudden and simultaneous arrival of a human to a given area. Rather, the process was gradual, with each species of animal gradually becoming human-domesticated before moving on to the next species (with a gradual evolutionary shift in the course of which the original species no longer had a chance to re-domesticate itself). However, the human-domestication of animals in any given environment can be viewed, at times, as an almost-instantaneous process.

One important aspect of animal domestication which may have changed the fundamental nature of our relationship with the entire animal kingdom is that the process has, in most cases, always been a peaceful one. The domestication of many domesticated animals has been carried out with due respect and great human interest in the animals concerned. Domestication by human beings has also been very gradual. As a result of this, the process of animal domestication, in many ways, resembles that of agriculture. One of the main reasons for this similarity is the fact that, by nature, every human being is a natural farmer. That is to say, every human being is an omnivore, except for a few rare exceptions such as a few persons with physical disabilities and a few humans suffering from mental disorders. Thus, domestication by humans involves the animal becoming a ‘domesticated’ animal for the first time. The first stage of this process is ‘natural domestication’, when the animals in question are raised as domestic animals. Such animals are raised and reared in their own natural habitat. Animals raised in this way are known as natural herbivores, in contrast to those whose first instinctive reaction is to become carnivores; such animals are known as true ruminants. (In addition, there are those natural herbivores which can be raised to domestic status with almost no human intervention or
