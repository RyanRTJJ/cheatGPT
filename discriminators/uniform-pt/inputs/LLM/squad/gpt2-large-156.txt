 Understanding that we are what we think we are. Locke is a critical thinker, and while he accepts that the existence of things and their existence independently can be known, he also accepts that one must know whether a person is a rational being (or, indeed, a self-aware being) if they to be aware of their own natures. In the case of people, it was thought at this time that the way their minds operate reflects their rational nature, while in the case of natural "things" they reflect on their rational nature with reference to how they act upon other objects. This means things as distinct from things themselves, things, for that matter, have their own personalities, even when they are considered within the same kind as things. By focusing on these different parts of mind, one could gain insight into why certain people are attracted to certain things, or why certain things are undesirable. (This is a major theme in our first three posts in the series.) Locke's view became known as "natural reason" and became a guiding force in philosophical debates until the 17th century.

More recently, the concept of mind has undergone intense scrutiny by psychologists trying to establish whether this is a genuine feature of human awareness, or whether it is a social construct. According to the most prominent accounts, the human mind is a purely psychological process which functions just like the mind of any other animal or plant.
