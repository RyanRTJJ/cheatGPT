England’s first permanent settlement in the Americas was founded in 1607 in a remote part of the North American continent, led by the ambitious Captain John Smith and managed by the Virginia Company. That island, Bermuda, was founded and claimed by Britain a few years later. This is the story of the English colony on an island just 60 miles south of Newfoundland in Newfoundland, Canada. It is also the story of the first settlement of Bermuda and its first governor, Governor Thomas Doughty, a man with a mission. He sailed from England on the First Fleet and spent 10 years as captain of a Dutch trading ship working in the Caribbean. He then set sail to Bermuda on a ship called the John and arrived in 1610 with just three men and a ship's cat on board. He was the first governor of Bermuda and his story forms the basis of this biography, which also charts the changing landscape between the colonies of the Old World and the New, which is often compared to a changing ocean floor.
