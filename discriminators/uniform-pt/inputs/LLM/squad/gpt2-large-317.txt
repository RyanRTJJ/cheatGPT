 the court is called the Jerusalem Municipality seat. The court is in charge of the legal matters of the people of Israel, their government, and their economy. The court has the powers under the Supreme Law of Land and Property, the Civil Code, and the Criminal Code.

In addition to the Supreme Court, the Jerusalem Municipality provides a number of services for the people of Jerusalem. For example, the municipality has been operating the Jerusalem Water Company for over three decades to serve the people of Jerusalem. The Jerusalem Municipality also administers the municipal and public parks and pools. The municipality provides a series of services to the people of Jerusalem. Such services include garbage pick-up, garbage dumping, water, electric, sanitary sewerage, roads, water distribution, etc. The Jerusalem Municipality is one of the largest municipal authorities in the world. It is also the largest in Israel. The municipality supplies water at less than one centimetre per foot, and sewage services to nearly half the city of Jerusalem. The municipality supplies water and sewage services to the city and its entire municipality.

The people of Jerusalem have made the municipality their source of water and sewage service. They have elected the municipality president and other officials in accordance with the Constitution of Israel. This is an example of participatory democracy.

For our part, we are proud that the municipality supports our cause in various ways. We have the opportunity to use the services provided by the municipality in cooperation with the city, the municipality, our clients, and the people of Israel.

The municipality is an institution based on the ideals of participatory democracy and social inclusion. It provides services to the entire community. This is the best way for the municipality to fulfill its functions. Therefore, the municipality must operate under the principle of equality for all members of society. For this reason, it is important for all residents of the city and of the municipality to be equal before the law. These principles motivate the municipality to cooperate with the law, not restrict this relationship.
