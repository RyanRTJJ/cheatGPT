, the farther along on their identities they will develop.

But why do more privileged people get to decide earlier whether they will pursue particular activities and who they will meet? A new study published in Psychological Science and a soon-to-be-published study lead by researchers at Virginia Tech and the University of Pennsylvania find that the better off a person is, the more they are able to see that the actions of other people have little bearing on their own life, and what they can learn from them.

“There are differences in how adolescents of varying backgrounds experience life and then use them as a springboard to build important and life changing identities, as evidenced by the way they engage in identity building activities as adolescents change the nature of their identities as adults,” said study co-author Jeffrey Rosenfeld. In other study words, the social environments adolescents grow up in can set the rules for who will become who they are, and can be key building blocks in their identity development. These environmental factors can significantly predict identity development during adolescence, which in turn, significantly influences how people act in life and how satisfied people are with their lives.

To find out the social environments most influential to identity development among adolescents and to test this theory of social environmental influence on identities in adulthood, Rosenfeld conducted a longitudinal study
