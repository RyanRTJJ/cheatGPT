’Donoghue is set to announce that the MoD has ordered a series of new submarines during 2017. However, the newspaper also carries a statement from General Sir Richard Dannatt, the chairman of the committee which was issued on 15 March, which makes no mention of submarines and instead focuses on the need to re-examine the defence procurement system. The committee is seeking to ensure that the MoD has considered all strategic and operational options for defence in its current review process. The committee intends to write to the Strategic Defence and Security Review Committee (SDSR) to reiterate its recommendation that "a broad defence capability strategy" be produced as part of the SDSR process. An alternative option for the committee would be to recommend to all Ministers and the Prime Minister that the MoD should cease its development of any new submarines until alternative options have been considered fully. An article from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) published in the Times newspaper on 18 March also talks about submarines, though states that it is not clear what the plan is for building more at this stage. RUSI’s statement also includes a quote from Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary which states that "There is a need for the development of new submarines—as we recognise in the defence strategy."
