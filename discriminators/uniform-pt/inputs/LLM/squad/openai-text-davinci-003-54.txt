 known as the "Seven Expeditionary Forces of Hideyoshi" (秀吉七出兵). The armies were composed of various regional forces from various parts of Japan and were led by some of Hideyoshi's top generals.

The Seven Expeditionary Forces of Hideyoshi was the largest military force yet seen in Japan and the first to use firearms. The expeditionary forces included an estimated 167,000 soldiers and sailors and nearly 4,400 ships. Hideyoshi established a base of operations at Tsushima Island and sailed through Korea in what was called the Imjin War (or Seven Year War).

The expeditionary forces experienced much success in their initial invasion of Korea but Hideyoshi ultimately failed to successfully invade China. Despite his best efforts, the war ended in 1598 with Hideyoshi's forces retreating from Korea and no attempt to invade China ever being made.
