gimon Savers. The new series was broadcasted in Japan on April 02, 2006, making the approximate gap between the two series two years and eight months. The series concluded on March 25, 2007, after fifty episodes.

The plot of the series focuses on the character of Masaru, a teenage high-school student who is partnered with the Digimon, Agumon, when the two are thrown into a world of Digital monsters. They are part of a group known as the Digimon Savers, which is led by Daimon Masaru, who defends the human world from the threat of Digimon attacks. 

The series also introduced the concept of “Cradleon”, an artificial Digimon developed to serve as a “Digimon sanctum”, in order to protect Digimon from the threats of humans. The Digimon Savers also have access to the “DATS” (Digital Accident Tactics System) technology which allows them to capture and collect the Digimon, thereby allowing them to make use of their powers for the sake of good.

The series also features several prominent characters in its narrative, including Yoshino Fujieda, a new recruit of the Digimon Savers, who assists Masaru and Agumon in their mission; Kurata, a villainous character with opposite goals to the Savers; and Mercurimon, a powerful Digimon whose main purpose is to restore balance to the Digital World.

The series ultimately culminates with the grand finale in which the Digimon Savers have to ultimately defeat Kurata, Mercurimon, and Giromon in an epic battle. The battle was won in the end, restoring peace to the Digital World.
