 have, the more likely they are to be influenced by their surroundings.

For African-American adolescents, the environmental context for their social identities plays an almost critical role in their overall development. Many African-American adolescents do not believe their cultures are mainstream, and in fact feel they are persecuted for their cultural identity. At the same time, others feel the need to assimilate themselves into a mainstream environment. Others may feel their cultural background is the cause of any negative experiences they may be facing. The result is that many African American children grow up frustrated with their environments.

This talk will discuss some of the factors contributing to the current problem among African Americans and the reasons why these factors exist. As a result, these factors have also helped to contribute to some of the solutions to this problem. The factors cited will include: social class, culture, family, and school environments. The research cited will be related to how these factors have contributed to the problem, as well as how these factors have helped the researchers contribute to the solution. The research will include surveys, and interviews.

Dr. Stedman's presentation will highlight how some of the issues in African-American studies were brought up to deal with some of the larger issues identified in this research.
