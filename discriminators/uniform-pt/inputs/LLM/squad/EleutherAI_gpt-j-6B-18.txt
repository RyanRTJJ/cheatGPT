 Species in Nature" here at PhilZoSo. (The full PDF of the paper is not available for free yet via Google scholar.) They have lots of interesting stuff to say about the application of FST to human populations. They don't take up the issue of the nonexistence of biological species in nature but I find that issue to be much less interesting. I think it's a bit of a non-issue because I find it to be a bit of a "gimmick" in much contemporary genetics (which also applies to e.g. human population genetics), i.e. to use it as a mathematical tool for exploring the question "is there evolution in humans, which leads to speciation?" with a question in search of a non-answer, just as FST leads to non-answers. The question is just as meaningless in human population as it is in genetics.

While I would not say that the paper is worthless, it is very much a "me too" paper, if you know what I mean. What Long and Kittles do is just provide some examples that they feel support their hypothesis, and they even admit that the examples that they use only support their idea indirectly, by being the way that the data actually look. I was never convinced by that argument, that the theory makes predictions which only indirectly support the theory. The examples that they used had no implications for speciation or even for the question of whether speciation can occur in humans. All that these examples do is show that if we accept, or even ignore, some assumptions about the data, we may come to conclusions about the properties of a population. To illustrate that, let's take an example that Long and Kittles use as one of their examples.

Let's say that the alleles
