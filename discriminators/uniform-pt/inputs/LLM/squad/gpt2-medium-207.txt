 ago in a number of different cultures. This made it easy to study the effectiveness and safety of various treatments for various infectious or parasitic diseases and infections. Many of these treatments were developed after the discovery of antibiotics and other biological components or agents that improved patients' or their pets' mobility, and/or eliminated the signs of disease or of the parasites or pathogens. As with traditional remedies, these new compounds acted as useful agents. One of the earliest known examples of this was the anti-clostridium botulinum (also known as Botocephaly) an antibiotic used in surgical, immunosuppressive, bronchial, and other procedures for infections, such as scabies and pneumonia â€“ but not for diarrhea and encephalitis. An additional important use was in treating gout.

This period saw a rapid improvement in antibiotics' effectiveness against a wide swath of infectious and parasitic diseases. The most common forms of antibiotics discovered for a variety of infectious or parasitic diseases between 1840-1903 were penicillin, penicillin-clavulanate, streptomycin, streptomycin sulfate, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, floxacin, and ciprofloxacin sulfate. With the rise of chemotherapeutics (such as antibiotics, steroids, and antifungals), the antibiotic classes that were first introduced to treat infections remained, and improved resistance was found to more readily present in their natural counterparts. These drugs did indeed offer significant improvement and were effective in improving the conditions associated with infected animals, as early as
