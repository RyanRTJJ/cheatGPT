.e., oxidizable species), e.g., oxygen molecules oxidizes oxygen radicals, or oxygen is made into water by the reduction of carbon dioxide. In the past, researchers believed that these oxidation products are necessary for ATP synthesis, and have been the main determinants of ATP production. [14]

A 2008 review article in Science concluded that "the mitochondrial ATP biosynthetic cycle is regulated by an intricate chain of chemical reactions and metabolic pathways." The article reports that the most significant contributor to ATP synthesis are three processes. All three involve oxidative phosphorylation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. However, the two remaining methods are also significant contributors to ATP and are the main ways that ATP is produced in the cell. The main methods of ATP generation are: (1) oxidative phosphorylation (oxidize ATP), (2) oxygen production (increase ATP), and (3) reduction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (de-oxidize ATP).

There are significant differences in the role of these three processes and the roles of each. [15] For example, oxidation may be necessary in the first two steps of mitochondrium metabolism, but not in the last two steps. Also, oxidative modification of ATP can be detrimental or prevent the proper function of ATP.

A review article, published in Molecular Research, examined the mitochondrial mechanisms of ATP generation. Among other conclusions, it concluded that oxidative processing of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) increases oxidation of ATP levels in the mitochondrion, thus increasing ATP toxicity.
