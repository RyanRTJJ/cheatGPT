ia. This is a long term culture that is similar to the hunter gatherer-gatherer societies of Western Europe, including Finland/Norwegian Vikings. The only differences are differences in diet and a larger population with a more complex distribution of the land.

In the 3rd millennium BC hunter gatherers/survivors started to develop and migrate in northern Europe. It is estimated that there were 2.2 million of these hunter gatherers. Some have proposed that the Vikings' diet could even have resulted in the "virgin birth." By the 7th century BC there were 200,000 nomads living in southern Europe, some of which were probably Scandinavians and the descendants of early Slavic farmers.

Vikings lived in northern Europe through the 7th and 8th centuries BC. They were the main traders on the eastern Mediterranean coast for at least 2 centuries.

From the 8th to the 10th centuries AD, the population of Scandinavia, particularly the south, increased, mainly thanks to agricultural advances made by the first settlers, such as cattle farming. By the 1st millennium AD, it was estimated that 40 percent of that country's population was being raised from farm children. It was not until the 15th century that the population of Scandinavian settlements actually reached a plateau.

The number of people living on each corner of Scandinavia has grown to 100,000 today. Because of this, it is estimated that there are at least 30 percent more people in northern Norway, at most 35 percent in Sweden, at least 14 percent in Denmark, and perhaps as many as 15 percent in Finland.

But, then, what happened to Scandinavia as a result of European immigration from Northern Africa? Vikings only lived in Scandinavia for about 300 years and probably settled there because for some reason they were the only ones to have seen a better world â€“ at least if you consider the land they settled on. After the Vikings settled in central Scandinavia, what happened next? Scandinavian peoples
