This is a story about what happens off campus â€” the stories often go untold.

Off-Campus Racial Harassment

Racist incidents are not isolated to just "racist" Yale students. Just as is a story in the university community, they occur on campus as well. According to a 2014 survey by the Yale Daily News and the Yale Environment 360, an anonymous survey distributed to undergraduates at Yale, between 1,300-1,450 individuals surveyed reported a racialized harassment incident to the Daily News last year.
