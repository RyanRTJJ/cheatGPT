 or transcendental basis. To be clear, Popper, after some initial disagreement, embraced the existence of knowledge, but the notion that knowledge itself is objective can be difficult to accept. The idea that knowledge is objective is grounded in the Aristotelian "truth-is-content" approach, that is, knowledge is knowledge. Popper held that knowledge is content (in that it is not in conflict with or antithetical to objective reality); or the philosophical position that knowledge is not "entirely subject to empirical investigation." The epistemic position of Popper was that truth does not come into conflict with or conflict with knowledge. The epistemic position has not changed in the 20th century, however: Popper's main legacy remains a commitment to the essentialist epistemology, where being subject to the empirical condition is an integral part of being knowledge and being "entirely subject to subjectivities."

Popper's main contributions to physics are: quantum mechanics, which posits an interplay between space and time, and gravitation theory, which identifies the properties of objects in spacetime. He was a strong proponent of Newtonian physics and the application of classical mechanics to thermodynamics. Popper considered all of physics to be "scientific," with an essentialist epistemology where "the question arises, is something like this true or false?" Thus, if a theory is valid for one scientific use case at one moment in time, but in this particular moment a certain theory is false, then
