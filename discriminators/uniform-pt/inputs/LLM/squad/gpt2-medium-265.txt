 and as ancient as approximately 30,000 BCE, according to the Cornell University Press's website. The Romans, Spaniards, and Egyptians used copper to build buildings and pottery, while Chinese and Japanese also were known to use copper during periods of time when trade networks were very weak. But it's not the oldest, or one of the most advanced metals on earth, nor is it at least as abundant, abundant as silver or copper. Copper has been present on Earth for about 10,000 years, and as far back as at least 4000 BCE.

Copper has been in existence for quite some time on this planet, perhaps as long as 4000 BCE. Copper was discovered during the Gold Rush eras and was used for tools and armor, and was also used to construct homes, stoves, and to make bricks on sites such as Atlantis. It is thought that early people brought copper to this planet to make it valuable and useful. The fact that copper has a longer history is testament to how much this element existed on Earth prior to humanity living here. The earliest gold, silver, and silver-bearing deposits found in southern America are found in Mexico, and may be the oldest evidence of copper.

Copper was also discovered on Earth at another time, about 4 million years ago. Copper is an extremely common element, abundant in rocks like limestone, which was used for various technologies to build the civilizations
