 the psychology of identity focus on the relationship among the three major stages of identity formation: the pre-oedipal, oedipal and post-oedipal stages (De Bellis, 1970). From this point of view, development in self-concept involves three major phases: the oedipal, the psychosexual and the post-oedipal stages. At the oedipal stage identity formation occurs mainly within the ego ideal and the oedipal triangle and is the most intense stage of identity formation. At this stage the person feels most whole. After this stage ego ideal identification occurs usually with friends and parents and is the next strongest phase. At the post oedipal stage the person has reached social adulthood with more autonomy and control over his development. While all theories on identity formation are based on the idea of linear development, many theorists have disagreed with this line of approach and instead have developed theories on the importance of stages of identity formation. From these perspectives, individuals may have varying degrees of self-concept development at each stage and a variable degree of integration of these stages. The most influential theories of identity formation include those of Freud, Jung, Mahler, Erik Erikson, Adler, and Kohut.

Freud argued that the first to form was the libido which was the original drive. As the infant begins to use language the ego develops. The ego is what Freud thought of as an internal agency for regulating thought and behavior and contains three parts: a superego, a more mature conscience, and a ego ideal. Freud postulated that the Oedipal phase is the earliest and main agent of identity formation because it affects the ego ideal. Freud argued that during the oedipal phase children idealize the father and attempt to separate from their mother. This leads children to
