 (IPD) analyses â€” the Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews of the Near East." That study concluded, "When compared to other Ashkenazi Jews (Jews of European or Ashkenazi origin), Ashkenazim and Sephardim differ in proportions of Ashkenazi, East Asian, and European ancestry due to small amounts of African ancestry (Ashkenazim and Sephardim) and small amounts of Latin/European ancestry (Ashkenazim and Sephardim)."

According to the Jewish Genetic Association, "It is clear that Ashkenazi Jewry is much less diverse than European Jewry. These data clearly demonstrate that ancestry-based racial groups within Jewishness are much more racially similar to European Jewry than to Africans or Asians."

The study further concluded, "With respect to Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, we found that it is overwhelmingly common in Europe, East Asia, and the Americas. With respect to East Asian, we found that the commonest ancestry of Ashkenazi Jews is not exclusively in East Asia. In most regions of the world, Ashkenazi Jews (African and non-African) can be distinguished with confidence."

In addition to Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews, there are other populations of Jewish descent that have been documented, or identified with the "Ashkenazi" racial category, including:

Macedonians, which are part of the Eastern European nation of Bulgaria but are a distinct tribe that predates Judaism and are the descendants of ancient Greek tribes in Asia Minor.

Persians

Khazars

Manchurians

Yukhnye Trusnys in modern day Uzbekistan and Ingushetia

Caucasians

Turks

Lebanese

Ashkenazi is a racial category that is defined by ethnicity as identifying a set of people who share the same genetic ancestry (as defined by the IBO genes).

The term "Ashkenazi" comes from "Atheists of the Ashkenazi
