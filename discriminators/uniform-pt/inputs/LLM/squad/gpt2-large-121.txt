Series 6: Cyber Troopers Next

With the fifth series ending with its episode 20th anniversary, it took 10, 000 years for the sixth series to begin. This was the third of four series to be shown in a row, following The Seventh Seal by Studio Ponoc, and the third in the first half of the Digimon era. The first two series ended with a battle, both of the series featuring an unknown character, and the third, though it was the latest, had no such battle, instead focusing on the return of Rika and the original characters and the Digimon Adventure characters and setting.

The sixth series is also the last series to be titled after a specific theme in the series (in addition to Digimon Adventure tri.). It was made for a television anime adaptation to be presented as part of Digimon Tamers.
