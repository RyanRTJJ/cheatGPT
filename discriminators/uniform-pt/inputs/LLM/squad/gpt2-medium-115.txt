ppella composers could be highly disciplined, but were by no means isolated by religious or secular pressures on artistic or stylistic development; they were working on music that could appeal to the masses and remain a popular form regardless of their affiliations or interests. In an era whose Christian denominations were more numerous, the a capella was the language of the multitude—the music of those who were either converted or simply had the necessary skills to produce it. A vocal, low-energy choir, with an organ playing the leading notes rather than the supporting strings, could be the backbone of a musical world in which a "dancing boy" (whose name here seems misleading) could not only sing but act. An early example of the polyphony of a capella music is found through the music of Josquin de Paris, who wrote with his father, Joël de Paris, and was widely popular when the French church granted a "gothic" title to his popular works. Josquin d'Orléans was the father of Polytone, a polyphony of 16 traditional anachronisms: the a capella was created by this music, the three-part harmony is heard by a female vocalist, and the first chord is derived from the octave. The song "L'homme et le mourir" (Laughter, and You and me) is composed from the anachronistic cadenza of the anachronism célébration, and the title may therefore have come from the word "dixies."

The same type of a capella was created by French music master Jacques de la Charba in the early mid-16th century. Although he was originally known as Lachaire de la Charba and a known collector of music on lutes and horns in Paris, he soon made the transition to the new music of Paris in the 1620s when he performed his own hymnal on three horns, as depicted in these surviving images.
