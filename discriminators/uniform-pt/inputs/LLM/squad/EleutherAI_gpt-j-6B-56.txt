 be recent migrants to the region. The Y DNA haplogroup of the Amish has been previously published (1). We have obtained and analyzed additional Y chromosome data from four individual Amish men and one additional sample from the Amish population at large. The results indicate a similar Y chromosome structure as previously reported: 1) there have been few Y chromosome founders and there have been multiple Y chromosome lineages that coarrived in the area at more or less precisely the same time. 2) The Y chromosome founders were likely recent immigrants to Pennsylvania and Delaware. 3) There are multiple independent events of male replacement on the Amish Y chromosome. It is anticipated that new studies that focus on Y chromosome variation will elucidate more of these details.

Table 2. Descriptive statistics for the Y DNA data. N refers to the number of male members of the Amish population that could be unambiguously assigned to a defined haplogroup using the Y Chromosome Haplotype Reference Panel database (Harismendy et al. 2004).

The Y chromosome diversity data presented here are summarized in Table 2. The four samples from the Amish are highlighted by bold type. The data indicate that there has been no major change in the Y DNA diversity found among the Amish. There is a decrease in the average number of defined
