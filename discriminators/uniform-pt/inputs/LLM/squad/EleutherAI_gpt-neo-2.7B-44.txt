 cannot take in as much oxygen as mammals and suffer for it in the form of carbon dioxide. This may be the principal reason why birds must frequently carry-out large gas-exchange flights and require long periods of sleep to maintain their body temperatures.

The lungs of land birds are located on the sides or'ventrola' (ventral) side of the body. Birds are also capable of moving the two or three pairs of lungs to a different part of the body, or even carrying out total lung transplantation. Birds have the potential to heal themselves where human organs have become impaired or diseased. They have also been shown to have an ability to repair and regenerate broken bones where human medical technology is unavailable. In the case of an avian accident, it is not always possible for humans to remove a broken limb immediately. However, there is no evidence that birds can not heal their injuries or lose their natural abilities when this happens.

As previously mentioned, birds are also capable of using their lungs to inhale gasses for a period of time each day to enhance their survival rates during bad weather. Their ability to use this method of flying using their upper respiratory apparatus has been verified by scientists and aerobatics experts and can only be described as unbelievable and unbelievable to humans.

The ability to use the lungs in flight is a natural and normal use of the organs. Birds have been used for as long as people are on the planet, with the earliest documented use dating back to
