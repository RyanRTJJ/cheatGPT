 the Cards looked good at the top of the division. This would be the team's best chance to take advantage of having the league's best record the previous 2 seasons...and the Cards would end that first half of the season in last place.

The Cards would get swept by the St. Louis Browns in 4 games...then beat the Cleveland Indians, 5-3. But with that, the Cards would fall to the Cubs for the 2nd year in a row.

By season's end, the Cards would get swept to the Pirates for the 2nd year in a row-and the Cards had been swept by another NL East team.

The Cubs, meanwhile, finished the year with a 15-9 record in October and would lose the NL pennant to the Giants...2 games to 1.

So, what will the Cardinals do to get a division title in 1998? And is it really possible?

The Brewers won 97 games in 1996 (their 1st season in Milwaukee) and would make the playoffs after winning their division. I think they got better with this team...but not a lot. And, Milwaukee doesn't have any major assets to trade-their best prospects are mostly in the minor leagues with an uncertain future.

The NL Central looks very good to me at this point: The Cardinals again are solid, with no real weaknesses after getting their pitching core back together last year; the Pirates and Reds are battling it out for the second wildcard spot; Cleveland would be the wildcard as always-though you may not agree with me on that.

But if the Reds had made the playoffs, would they be as much of the threat? It seems that while the Reds got better last year with players such as Scott Rolen (who signed in Boston), and Mark Grace (who's a free agent this time around), they also got some significant players to retire in 1996. The Reds are still a young team...and a rebuilding team at that. The last team it would take is really St. Louis to catch fire all of a sudden.

In the AL Central, the Twins won 91 games, and I think they'll get better as the season goes on. The Tigers and Indians are definitely the teams to beat...and Chicago could
