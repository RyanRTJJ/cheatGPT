 Maratha army liberated Calcutta, and then proceeded to attack British and Allied troops, forcing them into a vicious fighting situation against a force of 30,000 Indian troops and 4,000 British artillery men. The British held their ground and inflicted serious casualties on their enemy. At least 200 British soldiers were killed. By 1:00 AM on 17 August 1738, the rebels had captured parts of Bengal, and the British, who were on the verge of collapse, were left with few options.

The British finally retreated to their fortification on the outskirts of Calcutta where they had stored the army abandoned by the Peshwas on 19 February 1739, with the intention of returning it to India on the morning of 19 April 1740. However, they found that the fortification had sustained considerable damage and was not ready to hold the army's return to India.

While British General Richard Barrington proposed to retreat to the nearest British city and to rejoin the battle of Marathah, the Peshwas refused. At the same stage, a Peshwa named Mughal Shah Alam of Jhelum rejected the British and urged on British troops. This allowed the Peshwas to launch assaults on British positions from their fortified camp and then, after several weeks, withdrew, and withdrew again, reaching the camp, the British surrendered on 1 August 1740. When the British refused to accept surrender of their army, they took over Malcha. By 1742 they were defeated by the rebels in the Malcha Valley.[36]
