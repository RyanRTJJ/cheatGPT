 includes a much greater proportion of terrestrial species than in Europe (Hutton, 1985, p. 22), and the variation that occurs in the Americas extends from temperate regions to tropical lowlands and is accompanied by differences in the patterns of forest development. Among the most relevant of the findings of continental biogeography are the following: (I) The southern United States and western Mexico have higher densities of forest-dwelling species than those in Eastern and Central America and north-central South America; (II) southern and eastern America have larger proportions of terrestrial species and are characterized by high densities of forest-adapted species of higher plant species compared with the western and central highlands (Hutton, 1985, p. 22-23); and (III) south-eastern America includes species of higher plant order, for example, trees, shrubs, and grasses (Hutton, 1985, p. 23-26).

The discussion of continental biogeography is extended in Chapter XII, which begins with the observation that plant species of the southern and eastern part of the Americas tend to be more closely related to those of central America. For the most part, plants of both the east and west of the Americas appear to have evolved from trees of the Mesopotamia (Hutton, 1985, p. 28-30; M. A. Smith 1971, pp. 592-599) clade. The most striking difference in the plant assemblage in North and South America appears to be a major shift
