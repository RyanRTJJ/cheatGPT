 fetus) can be determined in mid-adolescence in an estimated 66 percent of women in the United States, and some cultures estimate that before the age of twenty-one menarche occurs in approximately 80 percent (1, 2). But other research has shown that many adolescents (especially those of diverse cultures and race and ethnicity) experience a natural or culturally defined shift to adultlike sexuality as late in life; that is, while some have not had genital examinations for several years, adolescents in some cultures experience a transition to a life of sexual activity prior to the age of twenty-one (3).

Studies of nonmedical and medical aspects of early-life sexuality are critical to understanding and evaluating the complex health and well-being of our children. Thus, two recent studies are particularly noteworthy:

In addition to a large study by the Nurses' Health Study of menarche, the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II) has confirmed that adolescent women in the US have very varied forms of sexual experiences in early life, depending on cultural tradition and local conditions (4, 5). The data show that women who are more immersed in traditional religious and cultural practices typically develop a stronger sense of self-worth during the teenage years, at which time they enter sexual relationships with more peers and with more adults (5). Although many biological explanations exist for this shift, such as hormonal changes and postnatal experiences, it remains unclear whether the cultural shift accounts for much of the variance in adolescent sexual behaviors (5, 6).

It is notable that the Nurses' Health Study has not found a correlation between the number of sexual partners and or orgasm achieved during adolescence. Both menarche and orgasm are important biological milestones in female development. In the
