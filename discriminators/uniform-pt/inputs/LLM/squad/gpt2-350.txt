ie went. It appears that, for an early portion of this period Athanasius came from the city of St. Anthony in Gaul, as I recall. Athanasius came to the city, as part of the journey to Rome and from there to the city of Alexandria, and he then travelled, to Rome, further along the river Aga; he came, about twelve miles south of the main body of St. Louis, then he traveled a bit further from the main body of St. Louis in the direction of the town. This was about the time when he became acquainted with the Emperor, or rather, the Council of the Papal States, which, with Pope Pius IX., had a certain great and very significant influence on the life of a ruler. This Pope, with many great and notable persons, who was highly distinguished in the city of the city, and who was the patron and guardian of that city (and afterwards the court of Louis XIV.), had passed in a very considerable hurry. The Pope could in no way have expected Athanasius to arrive before him, and thus there came an unexpected and certain delay, as I have already said. If anything did emerge which enabled the Pope to have a better time, it was the great and very important fact that Athanasius had to go directly from the city of St. Louis to the town of Alexandria, since it was located where the main body of St. Louis was. But this, and the fact that the Pope was not present at any part of Athanasius' journey, prove that he stayed in the city by going over to the palace, that the Pope in Alexandria had an authority over him there, and that Athanasius was indeed his patron (so far as the case is concerned in the above mentioned, on the same date as we have here a letter from the archbishop of Tarentum to the head of the Church) who was able to bring about a good change of pace. Thus, to my opinion, Athanasius remained in Alexandria on the first of those days when he was to become very important, that is to say, in his reign, for his first year in power -- I believe that one of the most significant things about this event is, that when Athanasius arrived a few days before
