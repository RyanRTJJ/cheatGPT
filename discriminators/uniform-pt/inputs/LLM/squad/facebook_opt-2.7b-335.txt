, the incidence of Ashkenazi Jews as descendants of Druze converts was ~50% (Bray et al., PLoS Genet 11(6): e131103) [1]. This approach was highly contested: both David Irving and Ilan Pappe [2] argued that this assumption was implausible, given that both Druze and Druze converts were Jews, and the former would have been far more numerous than the latter, particularly among male converts. To be fair, Dr. Irvin has since apologized to Irving for misrepresenting him [3]. We also agree that this study, for its historical background discussion, is quite relevant for the present discussion as well. The study of Bray et al. had two major problems.

First, although the study used marker data, it was primarily based on linkage analysis, using a mixture of SNP markers, which makes it impossible to rule out a non-druze genetic source for the mutations used to estimate the conversion rate.

Second, the paper was based on only a small portion of Ashkenazi Jews, and only using a small subset of Ashkenazi Jews from Israel, which only covered those individuals with an overall Ashkenazi parentage (as opposed to Ashkenazi ancestry from mixed marriages with other populations, who are not represented). This meant that, even if the Druze and Ashkenazi conversion rates were equal, the conversion rate of Ashkenazi Jews might have been overestimated. In a similar vein, there is the possibility that the Ashkenazi proportion of converts might have overestimated the overall proportion of Jews in the world.

Now come the latest data. According to the Pew Research Center, there are almost
