 the best way possible, but ends with a character whose real sense of fatherhood often fades into an inability to function without them. In fact, we may never see a father who actually knows how to care for his child, whether by being a father, mother or sister.

I feel like this sort of thinking is so unnecessary and absurd that I just want to know about it and maybe try my best to show it to someone. Unfortunately, there's not enough research on this topic and in fact the study just isn't going anywhere. There's just no way to know of any fathers who didn't spend time with their child.

If they are in a position where they can raise a child, they are free to raise their children. They may be able to have it themselves or provide for them if necessary. Or, if parenting is a thing of the past, they might just be the people that need it the most. But they can't
