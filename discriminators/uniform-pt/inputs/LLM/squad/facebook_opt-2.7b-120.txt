 that go all the way from early formation to long-term preservation. It remains largely uncharacterized. In this paper, we studied the long-term stability of spatial memory by analyzing the molecular mechanisms underlying memory formation, maintenance, and removal. To this end, we used a new strategy that combines classical molecular techniques (single molecule imaging and fluorescence localization spectroscopy) with a computational algorithm (molecular dynamics) to model the molecular interactions that are important for memory formation. For example, we investigated the stability of visual spatial memories in a model system of single cell. We found that the short-term (1-2 h) stability depends on the spatial localization of proteins whose formation is required for memory formation, while long-term (months) stability was maintained by a protein localizing on synaptic vesicles (sacs). The overall model allowed us to predict for each of the molecular switches in the model that the probability of memory formation, maintenance, and removal are related to the expression levels of the associated proteins. We also investigated memory stability in mice whose primary memory is of either spatial information or food reward. We found that visual memory is more stable than food-reward memory in general; the long-term stability of visual memory is highly dependent on protein localization and depends on many, but not all, proteins. In particular, we identified one small group of proteins that is more strongly dependent on food-reward memory. These findings are of great interest to the field of neurobiology, the study
