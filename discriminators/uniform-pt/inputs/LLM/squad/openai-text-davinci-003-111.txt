 Dongyue, who were subsumed under the broader cultural term yue. From the 8th century BC onwards, the Tombs of Yue Kings, located to the north of the Zhou capital of Hangzhou, started to be constructed. By the middle of the first millennium BC any political unity in this area had eroded, and Zhejiang was crowded from the 8th century BC until the Warring States period with those of the Yue, such as Minyue and Ouyue.

During the Warring States period, the area we now call Zhejiang was under the control of the powerful Wu state. Soon after the Wu state fell to the State of Yue in 473 BC, its I-tek-kang became the first ruler of the Yue (or, more traditionally, the first king of the State of Yue). The area became independent in the Spring and Autumn period as the foothill of this mountain, known as the Wuyue Mountains, provided isolation and protection.

The modern name of Zhejiang is derived from a combination of the earliest known Chinese pre-Qin Dynasty name of this area, Yue, and the first character of the name the area was given when it was formed into a province in the Tang Dynasty, Zhe.
