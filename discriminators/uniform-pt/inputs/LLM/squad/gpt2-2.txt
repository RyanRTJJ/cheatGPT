 was no longer viable and that the oil revenue could not remain solvent indefinitely. In its book, Bush wrote that no matter how "insecure and bankrupt" Iraq was, no major U.S. government agency would try to intervene. He also wrote that one important exception in the Bush administration's "policy" was against Iraq for fear that US forces would try to seize its water sources. At the meeting of the American Geopolitical Community at the White House in 2001, George S. Bush told George W. Bush that he didn't think the Bush administration was serious about fighting Iraq. But Bush later said that "if Iraq is a threat, we will use military force, but we don't want to do that for reasons beyond, I believe, national security." (Saddam went on at times to justify this assertion as "a concession to our own national interest." But if a country did try to build an artificial military base there, it might also consider doing so, so it could "have a larger interest than the need to defend our home and ourselves politically" in the Middle East, Bush said. Bush wrote that he had a "great deal of respect" for Bill Clinton in his remarks, and told them he was hoping that Bush's words might put an end to his campaign for president. (Saddam is one of the Democratic vice presidential contenders and Bush had worked for Obama in the past, but Bush's speech was not part of his official duties.) Meanwhile, the State Department quietly ended the war in Iraq, and some of the United States' biggest allies turned to the Gulf Cooperation Council, not Washington, for assistance.

This was done because the Kuwaiti oil giant was worried about the oil embargo imposed by George W. Bush, which had helped it to develop some areas of oil. A U.S. aid embargo on Iraq is still in force, and
