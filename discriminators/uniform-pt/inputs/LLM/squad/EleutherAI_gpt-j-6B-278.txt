 dogs to bring down prey and trail it. Although firearms hunting is allowed in a few limited areas on land owned by the Wildlife and Fisheries Department, most hunting is carried out by shooting small game along the borders of forests or on game reserves.

Before the introduction of the new hunting regulations in 2012, approximately two million land animals were considered annually harvested by hunters (approximately 50 per cent of which were deer). Currently, hunters target deer, but are allowed to hunt other prey, such as the larger land-dwelling carnivores, with a rifle as well.

The hunting season has traditionally been October from 10am to 4pm, Monday to Saturday, but has recently changed to an 8am to 4pm season. There was no hunting on Sundays (the holiday of Bodden), with the exception of December 20, which was a non-hunting day for the Christmas season. Non-hunters must purchase a day hunting permit. From June to September, it is illegal to hunt in the rain forest, as this is the wet season. In addition, it is illegal to kill an individual species of wildlife, except during the hunting season, with the exception of the hunting of large carnivores.

Although there had been extensive efforts to conserve game during the 1960s-70s, game numbers remained low (the only large predator remaining in T&T was the man-of-the-sea (T. manatus), only occurring from the mouth of the north-eastern rivers in Tobago and Chaguaramas). After 1992, game numbers started to increase, with the establishment of more forested reserves and the reintroduction of the Manatee (T. manatus) to Tobago.

Hunting and other agricultural practices in Trinidad and Tobago result in habitat degradation and fragmentation. Overgrazing of some farmland by livestock has occurred, with the proliferation of feral goats. These goats, which are not native to Trinidad, have been an unwanted ecological nuisance. However, the establishment in 2010 of a control system, where goats and wild donkeys compete for food has helped reverse this trend. Nevertheless, there are concerns that such a successful program could be undermined if the annual land-clearing activities of farmers (which involve clearance of forest by land-burning
