ayn a thousand men, and an urgent message from Husayn's relatives in Medina.

Ibn al-Zubayr was now at home in Mecca and a very close relation of Husayn to the latter. Ibn al-Zubayr decided to return to Mecca and, fearing the effects of war on him, he decided to hide in the mosque and in the surrounding area. Ibn al-Zubayr knew that the Muslims would have their own battles to fight when Husayn tried to attack Yazid, and that he should therefore wait for a just chance to come by for him to escape.

Husayn and his family took a boat from the coast to go to Medina. He was accompanied by his brother Yazid, by his half-brother Ali, and finally by his half-sister Khadijah (later Khatar). Husayn began to plan how to attack Yazid in Medina, but there were a number of reasons why he might not be able to do that.

Yazid's army was probably two or three times bigger than Husayn's. Moreover, it was probably not at home in battle against the Muslims. Yazid had ordered his generals not to fight against Husayn. He was likely to have sent his family, soldiers and followers as bodyguards, and he knew that a large part of his army would be loyal to him (even though he allowed them to do their own work when fighting).

The fact that Yazid was a tyrant, and that the Muslims were in general disliked him, should be a good reason why he would be reluctant to attack the Muslims in Medina with his armies.

At the same time Husayn still had to overcome some of the difficulties.
