-hitter in his third start of the season for the Cubs' first regular season victory over the Mets in 12 tries at Shea Stadium in seven tries. The team would finish the season at.500, 13.5 games behind the defending champion Yankees.

The next year, Durocher and former Yankees manager Connie Mack were fired after the team won just 40 games. Chicago managed to finish the year at.500 and in third place in the division behind the Yankees and New York Mets. Durocher began to get some bad publicity when rumors and stories were leaked that he had been abusing the players in the clubhouse, using them for sex.

The son, being a major league catcher, asked the driver, Jerry, to drive them to an empty field behind a field house in suburban Reading, Pennsylvania. There,
