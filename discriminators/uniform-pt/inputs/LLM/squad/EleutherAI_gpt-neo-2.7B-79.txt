 Celtics' front office began the search for a coach to replace Caray, but ended up searching for two different coaches, with Kevin O'Connor and George Karl both landing on the front office.

A week after the Celtics' loss in Chicago to the Bulls, the front office announced that they had hired Joe Lapchick, the director of the Developmental League's Green Bay Storm, as an assistant coach.

Lapchick previously served as the head coach of the NBA Development League's Fort Wayne Mad Ants, where he won 50 games and led the team to the league's best record as the head coach. Lapchick's tenure with the Mad Ants concluded in late October when the Mad Ants were defeated by Bakersfield Jam in an NBA Development League first-round playoff series, and he was fired, ending what was his career with the Mad Ants.

Lapchick took over the Celtics' search for a new coach during the season, and was the coach of the Celtics for just a few games during the regular season before he was fired in early January.

After the hiring of Lapchick and before the February 29th game in New York, the NBA released two new coaches, Paul Fultz and Luke Jackson. After signing Fultz, the Celtics were one of six teams without an NBA coaching vacancy in 2014-15.

After several weeks of speculation, the Boston Celtics signed former Houston Rockets coach Jackson. A former NBA player himself, Jackson would be the sixth Celtics coach since Dunston's passing, and would be the first since Lapchick, when the Celtics filled their head coaching opening for the first time since Dunston's death in 1996 with Lapchick in 1999.

During his time as a head coach, Fultz compiled an impressive record of 67-65 (.560, three games worse than his previous high in the NBA with the Oklahoma City Thunder).

Jackson, however, was not as successful as Fultz in his first season in Boston, finishing with a 25-43 (.462), three-game improvement from the 25-47 (.464) record he posted with the Rockets last season. With his struggles in his first season as a head coach, Jackson was dismissed from his position with the Celtics on
