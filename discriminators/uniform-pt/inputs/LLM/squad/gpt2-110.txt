In 1613, the King of Scotland gave the Protestants of Ireland as a majority. The two kingdoms then split into different sects, each with certain traditions.

This effectively allowed the Queen of Scotland to take the Scottish throne from her predecessor, and hold the English country for her own gain. As in Ireland, where English rule expanded more quickly than any kingdom, there were divisions in the church and Protestants sided with each other.
