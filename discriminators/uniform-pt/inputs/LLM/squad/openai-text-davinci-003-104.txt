 attacks and allowed American and British intelligence agents to operate from Libya to combat Al-Qaeda operatives.

In 2004, Gaddafi's government accepted responsibility, and agreed to pay compensation, over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing of a Pan Am airliner in Scotland, which had killed 270 people. Libya was subsequently readmitted to the United Nations. Relations between Libya and the United States were also slowly restored, culminating in the removal of Libya from the US list of "state sponsors of terrorism" in 2006 and a visit by Gaddafi to the US in September 2009.

The potential for Libyan oil and gas inspired foreign investment. Economic reforms were implemented, and Libya had access to abundant foreign reserves, replenished largely by a significant and steady stream of increased oil revenue and revenues from abroad through privatization. During the later part of Gaddafi's rule, he gradually shifted from socialism to an economic system based on regulation and privatization. Despite these reforms, the process of liberalization was slow, and the country's economic managers were heavily reliant on oil revenue. 

Domestically, the government's social policies remained similarly cautious. The government maintained tight control of the media, engaged in censorship, and denied or delayed reform. Human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, increased significantly, and torture during detention was, reported by human rights organisations, widespread.
