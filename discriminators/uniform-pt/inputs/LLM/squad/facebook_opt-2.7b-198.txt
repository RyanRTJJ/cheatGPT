 written, and genuinely moving", while Robert Christgau of the Village Voice remarked, "There's not a weak note to be found, from the dazzling production to the fine performances."

Plot
Chilean singer Eva Perón rose to power in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, and her charisma helped to raise her country's profile on an international scale. To help her win back popularity after her departure from the world stage, she launches a singing competition with a focus on singing that will be judged by a committee of celebrities. She then becomes romantically involved with her protégé and first love, and singer General Juan Perón.

Eva struggles to maintain herself within the confines of a society that would rather that she withdraw from public life. Her marriage to Juan is filled with sexual tension, and the general public is horrified by her personal failings. When she attempts to end the marriage to restore her reputation, she is physically threatened by the press secretary; he then becomes a lover, and she gives an ultimatum that forces the couple to divorce. Despite Juan's denial, Eva leaves him and spends the rest of her life rebuilding her international reputation. After her death, her daughter, Julietsí, inherits the mantle of the national fame, and seeks to rebuild a separate identity for herself rather than carry Eva's burden of being her mother.
