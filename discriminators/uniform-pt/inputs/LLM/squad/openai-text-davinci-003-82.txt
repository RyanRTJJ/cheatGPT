as often indirect and based on local leaders, both Manchu and Mongol, Tibetan, and Muslim. This policy of indirect rule allowed the Qing to maintain control while allowing some autonomy to diverse indigenous peoples.

The Qing established various administrative institutions and various laws to govern the outer regions. These laws and regulations included a prohibition on fighting and warfare, regulations controlling entrance and exit, a ban on alcohol and opium, and the establishment of imperial courts and judges. To keep order and ensure loyalty, the court created a number of banners (military units) to maintain control.

The Qing also invested greatly in public works, transportation, and communication infrastructure in these outer regions. This included roads, bridges, telegraph lines, and even the construction of the Grand Canal. To ensure loyalty, the court also sent frequent imperial missions to visit the areas “barbarian” regions, as well as providing generous patronage and subsidies to local leaders.

Overall, the Qing created a large, relatively peaceful and prosperous outer empire by taking a largely indirect approach to rule. This allowed them to capitalize on local dynamics while at the same time minimizing the risk of revolt and unrest. These policies were supported by their investment in infrastructure and their commitment to respecting local customs and culture.
