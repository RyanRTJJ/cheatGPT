 in Bermuda, or between Bermudians and the wider British community in Bermuda. This paper argues that the deep ancestry of the majority of Bermudians, and the island’s lack of ethnic identity, are two key characteristics of Bermuda’s cultural geography. It argues that it is possible for Bermudian identity to begin to form through a process of cultural exchange with a more diverse and cosmopolitan population, as has happened in Bermuda's history in the Caribbean (for example in the past decades with Bermudians immigrating to Antigua). It then examines how the identity of Bermudian cultural identity can be built through such a process. The paper concludes with the suggestion of a proposal to build the cultural identity of Bermudians by linking it to their deep ancestry and their shared history of immigration into Bermuda, and suggests that Bermudian cultural identity can be rebuilt by a cultural education on that history.

The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries. There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white in Bermuda, or between Bermudians and the wider British community in Bermuda.
