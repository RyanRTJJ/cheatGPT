 the American strategy was flawed from the outset.

1- the US lost the ground war on the battlefront and were unable to maintain the offensive, which ultimately allowed the Russian offensive to develop momentum

2- Russia gained the initiative in the battle by launching a feint attack in the north, which kept the US distracted

3- this allowed the Russian military to regroup and organize without interference from US forces

The first mistake that was made (and the one that is still causing problems for US military planning today) was that the strategic goal was to maintain the momentum and force the Russians to make a second front in the north. This, of course, was never the intent as the plan was to defeat Russia, not push them off their strategic position. But because of the American lack of preparation in the ground war, no plan was ever put in place to counter the feint and allow the Russian push to develop its momentum.

And this is what allowed Russia to use their superior command and control to prepare and plan for a counter offensive from the south where they knew the Americans had a weak command structure in the north, and because the American strategic plan did not envision the need to counter, the plan to push further south and drive up the river valley to Kaliningrad was easily executed and allowed the offensive to develop momentum. Itâ€™s interesting that it was the same strategy that Hitler used to defeat the French and Russian Armies at the
