ppella music that continued it's development in Germany in the late 14th century consisted of simple, repetitive, one- or two-voice chants. During the 15th century, the German Bach style came to the attention of other parts of Europe.

This practice eventually became called the Beaufort-Gourmont system, and it was used for every composer, as it was popularized by him.
