 addition to native species being threatened, it is a serious threat to other species that are negatively impacted by the invasions, which are called as alien species(ES).

ES are alien species that have been introduced into a different habitat from a different origin. The invasions (i. e. moving species to another area) are usually the result of human activities such as transportation, farming, ranching, or human activities in the area.

Alien Species in the USA

In 2017, there were 944 species of alien species reported which are the most of all, in the USA. We are talking about a total of more than 10,000 alien species that are established in North America.

Alien species in America include insect eggs, fish eggs and larvae, rodents, molluscs and crustaceans, plants, fungi, algae, protists, fungi and seeds, insects, earthworms, aquatic invertebrates, and birds.

In the last few years, the alien species’ number has been gradually increasing and it is believed that this increase will continue, which is a problem that needs to be addressed. Many are endangered, but many are not listed as endangered, but protected by the federal law, the Endangered Species Act (ESA). For this reason, many are currently in danger. For a complete list of all species that are here, go to my website’s alien species list.

The reason alien species are increasing is because the human activity is increasing. Human activity increases the alien species’ number (Table 1) as human activity involves
