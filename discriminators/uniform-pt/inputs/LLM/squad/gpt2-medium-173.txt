). Because of the frost-prone climate, cotton leaves must be harvested each year, but only after a few heavy rains. One of the most important factors determining the harvest time depends on the type of plant. Some plants will grow until the leaves and stems are gone, while others may grow until there are still a few ripe leaves, and then can be harvested.

The seedling tree is smaller and takes longer to develop than the mature tree, so if your cultivator has not had the time to harvest the seeds before harvesting, they may have overshot a harvest time.

How to make Your Own Cotton Seedling Trees Your project will be completed in about two months. As the seedling grows, the trees need fertilizer: In the garden, cuttings from the plant produce a great amount of fertilizer. Cuttings are small and round rather than large, and are held in plastic bags, like straw, so they do not get too warm. Just use as much as you can. The plant needs to be given a good water supply, but it will do great if the soil is deep enough. Keep it in a shallow, well-drained zone to preserve it and make it difficult for weeds to invade.
