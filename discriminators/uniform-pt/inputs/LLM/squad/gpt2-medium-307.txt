In recent years BYU has attracted notable big-name recruits.

In 2013, former Utah football coach Kyle Whittingham committed to the Cougars and BYU's offensive line led the program to bowl wins in 2014 and 2015.

The Cougars' 2014 recruiting class was led by former Iowa tight end Jake Butt, with the incoming freshman tight end Ben Garland leading the way.

In 2015 the recruiting class also featured quarterback Zach Smith, receiver Tyrell Williams, offensive guards Tyler Whiggan and Andrew Tiller, defensive tackle Johnathon Blalock, offensive lineman Mark Luecke and linebacker Jon Blumberg.

In 2016 the Cougars' class included defensive tackle Ben Malena and offensive lineman Marcus Burley.

In 2017 BYU had a starting class that featured defensive lineman Matt Elam and defensive end Joe Kruger. The 2016 and 2017 recruiting classes also had defensive tackle Eric Crouch, offensive guard Jeff Davis, wide receiver Isaiah Williams III and running back Chris Brown.

Butler, Fuller, Tiller, Butt and other recruits will be part of BYU's 2017 recruiting class but will not be able to get into the 2016 class the way they were in 2016.

It is unclear where those players will be joining the Cougars in 2017.

"I think once recruiting breaks through and all the kids come forward, there's gonna be a big impact for the 2015 class," Smith said.
