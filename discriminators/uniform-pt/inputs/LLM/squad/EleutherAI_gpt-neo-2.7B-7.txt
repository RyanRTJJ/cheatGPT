 dull," and Richard Lawson of the Chicago Tribune was more succinct, calling the show "unstintingly good" and, in the end, "surprisingly good (and not bad just because Fox wants it to be bad)."

The Los Angeles Times agreed with Lawson.

The show began with good intentions, as well, and a number of critics considered that the show and its judges were all on the same page.

"We are a pretty diverse lot, and if this makes our job easier, we can only hope," David Daly of The Washington Post noted.

However, many critics were also left thinking that the producers of the show, which cost about four hundred and eighteen million dollars, had chosen the wrong type of talent to choose for this summer's version of America's Next Top Model.

"So when you hear about how some of these new judges are 'artists,' it's kind of a misnomer," wrote The New York Times. "In fact, they are, as we have previously noted, people who have done exactly what is expected of them - like hiring them to judge how we have handled our personal lives."

"All talent would be good, and I guess that's what many of the top female models think too, but just because you're good at it doesn't mean you're good. It's far better to do what people expect and not say, 'I'm so good I wouldn't need the extra challenge,' " countered the same article.
