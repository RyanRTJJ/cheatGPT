 continents of Gondwana and Laurasia, respectively, during the Late Cretaceous and Late Triassic. The Earth went through a huge mass extinction after the Cretaceous: an event sometimes described as the "Great Dying." This cataclysm caused by overfishing and global warming is often referred to as the "Age of Dinosaurs." The dinosaurs disappeared as a species about 67 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous because of climate and sea level change that occurred in the supercontinent Pangaea. There was a great explosion of marine life including the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs in turn disappeared from the Earth after the Jurassic Period. All these processes were known, but the dinosaurs did not become extinct by themselves. They had been extirpated, and in the last two million years, the extinction of some species of dinosaurs began.

The dinosaur extinction marked the start of the Jurassic period. Scientists used radiocarbon to estimate the age. They first determined a "starting point" for the dinosaur extinction: 65 ± 10 Ma. According to that, an extinction event called "the Great Dying" roughly corresponds to 65 million years ago. That is the beginning of one of the most significant extinction events on Earth, known as the Miocene Epoch. It is also called the "Big Freeze."

The Cretaceous Period lasted another 65 ± 17 million years. During this time the Earth went through a number of major mass extinctions involving enormous,
