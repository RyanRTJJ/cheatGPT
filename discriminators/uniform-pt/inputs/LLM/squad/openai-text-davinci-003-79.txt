 Cubs looked to a younger core of players. Alex Gonzalez was named the starting shortstop and the cornerstone of the team, Kerry Wood and Mark Prior, became the primary starters of the pitching staff. Wood threw a 20-strikeout complete game on May 6, 1998, setting a rookie record. Gonzalez, Wood and Prior would be joined by Sammy Sosa and bull pen stalwarts Kyle Farnsworth and Rod Beck to form the core of the team. 

The Cubs finished their 1998 season in second place, with a record of 88-74. They made their first postseason appearance in eight years, finishing with a 2-3 record and making a great yet fruitless effort to reach the World Series. They went through a great number of highs and lows during the year, but the inspiring season gave Cubs fans hope of a championship. 

Following this, the Cubs made the playoffs many more times in the 2000s.  They didn't win the World Series until 2016, with a roster full of new talent that included Anthony Rizzo, Kris Bryant, Javier Baez and Kyle Schwarber. However, the 1998 team set the foundation for the future success of the franchise.
