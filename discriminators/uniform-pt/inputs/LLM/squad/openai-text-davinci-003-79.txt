In the Catholic tradition, the Immaculate Conception was declared a dogma by Pope Pius IX in 1854. However, this teaching was already held by many of the early Church fathers, such as St. Augustine as early as the 4th century.

The belief in Mary’s total and complete sinlessness has been a part of the Christian faith since its inception, with references found within both the Old and New Testaments.
