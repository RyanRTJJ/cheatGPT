In November, Islamic State gunmen captured a 16-year-old Israeli citizen in a house in the Old City and later released him. The video he shot before the kidnapping shows him holding a pistol next to the door, presumably holding onto them as they were about to be thrown out. Israeli authorities have not said how he managed to escape.


In August, a Jewish mother from Tel Aviv was abducted by the Islamic State, although her body was not found until six months later.


Earlier this month, dozens of families in the West Bank were forced to evacuate their homes. A month earlier, several buildings were razed by fire in the Palestinian village of al-Dura near Hebron.


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the Israeli operation in Hebron, saying: "We have to stand firm against the terror that has been unleashed. I would like to express to the family of the missing teen â€“ the entire nation offers our deepest condolences."

An investigation into the disappearance of Yatsuf was launched by the Israeli army four days after his abduction. He was reportedly last seen entering his home from the entrance to his neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber.
