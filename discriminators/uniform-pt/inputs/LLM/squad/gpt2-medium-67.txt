After taking his first big step as a professional wrestler, Schwarzenegger decided to follow in his mother's footsteps as a model. He became a model from childhood in San Diego through adulthood as he looked at his body and what it could do, focusing on the positive aspects in his own body.

"In a way I hope it will help them look at themselves," he said.

He added, "I hope they are able to look at their bodies as healthy, not as some sort of shameful look."

Schwarzenegger said he now looks up to his former rival for his career achievements.

"This is one thing I'm really proud of my father," he said. "He did everything he could have done."

Born on Jan. 25, 1960 in Mexico City, Schwarzenegger grew up idolizing Bob Marley as the music star of Motown and the late Michael Jackson.

"In high school I was in Boyz II Men, and my agent said, 'Hey, we have a movie thing coming up,'" Schwarzenegger said. "So we go in for scouting."
