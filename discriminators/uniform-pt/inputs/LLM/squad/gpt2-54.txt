 of forty thousand soldiers to attack the Chinese. From 1815 until 1625, the army of fourteen thousand strong was the only force for China's defense.

This invasion, a massive offensive by an army able to destroy virtually every unit in the country's defense, was the culmination of the Russo-Japanese War of 1811 and 1815, which saw the Japanese conquer vast areas. Yet Toyotomi Hideyoshi's own policy of trying to occupy the Japanese mainland and not to use the force to neutralize the Chinese left its mark and made the invasion "the biggest and most comprehensive invasion that the world has ever seen."

It was after the defeat of Admiral Akimichi Tsuru's forces in the Second World War that Toyotomi's most active leader, Aoba Yagawa (藤草田), was defeated in Japan. The Japanese had been ordered by General Goto to invade China in 1789, not after a similar defeat had been achieved by their Japanese counterparts. Aoba was not able to successfully conduct an actual invasion, even one with the potential of turning China into a militarized country by itself. Toyotomi Hideyoshi was able to successfully secure the victory against the Chinese.

As a result of the Battle of Yamashita, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and his fellow commanders were able to successfully defeat and then defeat the Chinese forces during the First World War. The Second World War was an epochal event in both Japan and the United States of America. In addition, Japan's national interest at the time was to continue to be important in the development of the U.S. military.

The Second World War

In 1818, Tsuru had reached the Battle of Yamashita and, on December 10, he came under massive attack. He was surrounded, by his allies, by two thousand infantrymen. There was no retreat at Yamashita, and not a single single unit of Japanese troops came to attack him.

To protect themselves from the fire, Tsuru used a large fire-engine capable of reaching a depth of 300 m. He and his men formed a small formation and moved for the top of the hill on what looked to be an open field with three columns. The
