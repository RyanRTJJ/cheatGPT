In September 1940, with Churchill's troops and those of France and the Netherlands retreating, the Luftwaffe made a decisive contribution by dropping an incendiary bomb and a small incendiary bomb on a shipping container holding food in the Channel, killing 29 and burning some 30,000 tons of British food.

This marked the beginning of what became the Blitz: large-scale bombing of British cities, starting in early July 1941.

The Blitz continued until October of the following year. Its initial targets were the cities of England: Southampton, Brighton, Liverpool, Newcastle, Brighton on The Downs, Manchester, Sheffield, Manchester Airport, Bristol and other towns. The RAF's main target was the North Sea oil terminals, particularly at Scapa Flow (Scotland) and Sheerness (England). A secondary target was Scotland.

The Germans wanted to demonstrate their military might to the British and demonstrate that Germany could inflict massive damage on the British by bombarding major cities which did not even produce oil or timber in sufficient quantities to be of much military importance.

The Bomber Offensive

The RAF needed more than 1,200 strategic bombers to carry out the strategic bombing of British cities in order to destroy key targets, such as oil terminals or munitions factories. It was
