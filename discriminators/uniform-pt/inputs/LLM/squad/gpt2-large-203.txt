 River at Kiho. On the morning of September 3, the Japanese left Yang-yang Station with a 3rd Division, advancing to Yueyang in the direction of Tientsin, which was captured while the enemy was awaiting word to move back. On the afternoon of September 4, they launched a second attack, the advance being halted in the afternoon. However, they pressed on, making an advance into Tientsin in the direction of Nanchang when enemy reinforcements overtook them. In their retreat they pushed for Hainan at the same time.

The Third and 4th Japanese Divisions advanced and took part in the decisive Battle of Nanchang on September 5. Their losses in this battle on a frontal assault were negligible and only four Japanese soldiers were lost. The division fought hard without difficulty throughout the remainder of the war.

For the battle of the Hunan Campaign the Japanese were at the top of the enemy's list of military targets, although this only intensified the conflict when the American invasion was postponed. They were assigned a priority that the other Japanese divisions either couldn't or didn't hope for.

The Japanese would have had an advantage after this battle if they had been able to keep their main force moving in line with their attack lines. However, with their lines breaking and reinforcements being sent to their right flank, they couldn't get anywhere near the enemy's main line. Therefore, they decided to retreat in the east in a three group advance into the Hunan region.

This plan was abandoned when Japanese reinforcements were in the way and the whole front moved back to the Yenan front.
