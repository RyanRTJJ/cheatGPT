 have remained in contact with each other. If such ancient DNA is found in recent Jewish populations with a high frequency, it could indicate a continuous movement of Jewish females to different locations on the globe and into a particular time period.

"It is possible that these ancient Jewish women lived in small, isolated communities that came together as they spread out of the Middle East. They may have been living in the Middle East for a few generations or even longer," says Yohanan Sud, the first author of the paper.

In addition to the Y-DNA study, the researchers analyzed DNA from a Jewish couple from Denmark who gave birth to two children in the early 1950s. The woman had undergone ritual circumcision. Using a special protocol that could detect ancient DNA from a large, modern population, the researchers extracted DNA from her womb. The resulting DNA contained a mixture of Y-chromosome and mtDNA sequences.

These ancient DNA segments are characteristic of East Asia and are more common than any other ancient genome sequences that have been identified using the technique. The results indicate that the woman lived in a region that is now under pressure from human migration.

"A lot of research is being done that looks at gene flow between various regions, particularly from the Middle East to Europe," Sud says.
