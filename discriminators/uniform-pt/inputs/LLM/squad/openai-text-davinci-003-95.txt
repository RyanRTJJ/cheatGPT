 and has sold more than five million copies worldwide as of August 2017.

The release of the album was a preplanned strategic move by Beyoncé and her team, who called it a "visual album." It featured 14 new songs and 17 music videos. The mixed-media elements of the project allowed it to stand out from other artist's releases and make a splash in the digital music market. Additionally, Beyoncé took back full creative control of the project and became one of the first mainstream artists to do an online-only album release.

The album marked a turning point in Beyoncé's career and established her as a powerhouse in the mainstream music industry. Its themes often centered around black female empowerment and its release coincided with a period of social activism within the African-American community in the wake of the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012. Beyoncé used the album to bring attention to the issues and to advocate for system reform that would benefit marginalized communities.

The release of the album was a huge success for Beyoncé, with critics praising her artistic versatility and the commitment to her vision throughout the project. It won two Grammys, including Best Urban Contemporary Album, and went on to influence the music release strategies of other popular artists such as Kanye West and Drake. It is widely considered to be a landmark album in both music and marketing history.
