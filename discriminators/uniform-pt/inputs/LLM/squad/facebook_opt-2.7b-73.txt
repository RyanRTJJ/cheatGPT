 that there is at least tacit agreement on the existence of a moral world in which people act with respect for others' rights. Such accounts have been developed within a broad tradition known as ethical evolutionism.[2]

Ethical evolutionism maintains that moral attitudes and beliefs come about through interactions between humans and other creatures, including those of our evolutionary ancestors. It therefore does not require natural selection in order to account for the emergence of moral beliefs and attitudes. Instead, it describes them as reflecting a process of gradual evolution,[3] by which humans gradually acquired moral beliefs in society via interaction.
The theory does not, however, account for the emergence of moral feelings that can overcome the influence of the influence of society. This is done by calling such feelings evolved feelings,[4] and arguing that such feelings develop via interaction with nature, and through a process of moral development.[5]

Most mainstream evolutionary psychologists have concluded that while moral evolution is supported by some evolutionary psychological evidence, that evidence has not yet been able to justify a position that moral evolutionism should be taken seriously. They feel that "a reasonable and plausible alternative" has been presented by cognitive evolutionist John O'Donohue.[6]

In the United States and Canada, the philosophical journal Ethics, Ethics, and Evolution has published two articles that advocate evolutionary ethics. These were written by sociologist Timothy Williams and psychology Professor John O'Donohue. The Society of Psychologists of the Pacific has published other articles promoting the idea.[7][8] In the United Kingdom, moral evolutionism has been discussed by the Scottish Philosophical Society.
