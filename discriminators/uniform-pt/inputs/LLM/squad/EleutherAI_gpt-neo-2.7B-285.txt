 J. "The Colonel," whose job was to "drive a few dollars in the hands of the Westerners."

The first robbery took place on September 17, 1877, when William J. "The Colonel" robbed a Western Central and North Western passenger train, armed with a.38-caliber revolver. He and two accomplices, Sam Pritchett and Sam Wood, were convicted and sentenced to death for shooting and kidnapping the conductor. Their appeal was denied, and they were hanged on September 28, 1877.

After the hangings, a group of citizens wrote to President Rutherford B. Hayes to protest the hanging of "men who aided to create the worst of human misfortunes."

In June 1878, the New York Times reported that on March 28, a man was driving down West Street in New York City when he was shot by a masked man who demanded, "Have you no money?" The suspect was then forced from the car and shot again, as the car continued down West Street toward Fourth Avenue.

A few months later, another holdup occurred on July 16, 1878, in which another masked gunman and two passengers were apprehended. The gunman, who had a knife in one of his pocket, demanded, "Where is your gold to come from?" He then stabbed the two passengers, a lawyer named John W. Coughlin and his son-in-law Frank S. O'Malley. The three men escaped from the car alive. Coughlin and O'Malley filed a $2,000 lawsuit against William J. "The Colonel," Sam Pritchett, and Sam Wood. Coughlin sued for two additional $500 damages. O'Malley sued for $1,500 in damages. The defendants were convicted in the resulting trials,
