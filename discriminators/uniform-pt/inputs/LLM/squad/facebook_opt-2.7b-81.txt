, but the characterâ€™s most distinguishing feature is his large spiked shield. This shield is the result of genetic modification, a technology used to modify humans for fighting purposes, and is created to be used by any of the X-men, the Sentinels of Marvel Comics, the Morlocks of Marvel Comics, or Wolverine of Marvel Comics. The shield can be broken in the style of any Japanese weapon, and with a powerful stab it can be manipulated into various weapons to use against the opponents to which it is attached. The armor worn by the character is usually fashioned from armor or steel, but some versions use lighter designs.

History

The Silver samurai is a member of the X-men who has adopted the persona, and who is genetically modified to be the perfect fighting tool, more dangerous than any mutant. He is the leader of the Silver Samurai and is generally the leader throughout the Silver Samurai team, although other members have been considered to be more powerful or more valuable to the team by other members. The original Silver Samurai is depicted as having an inhuman physique from the waist down, and a set of bionic arms which also feature an ability to manipulate the shield he carries.

The Silver Samurai is first introduced at Wolverine's house in the mutant homeworld of America during World War II, when his father Wolverine is taken as a prisoner of the Nazi's.
