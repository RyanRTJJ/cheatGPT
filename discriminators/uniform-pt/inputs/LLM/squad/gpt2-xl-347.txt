 good hydration is a function of adequate water intake alone has been discredited in the face of empirical evidence suggesting that drinking water alone is not an effective method for reducing high blood pressure or for maintaining hydration. The effect of different water soluble vitamins on blood pressure and body fluid and electrolyte balance is a topic of debate among clinicians. Some researchers have argued that the potential for harmful effects of the various water soluble vitamins has been grossly underestimated because they have a low solubility in the stomach. In some cases, the solubility of water soluble vitamins in the blood and other body fluids has been found substantially lower than earlier research had suggested. While it is always preferable to drink water first thing in the morning and for all meals, it is also important to drink water in a well-formed stream (rather than a cup), because water from a poorly formed stream was found to reduce blood pressure and increase fluid retention (16).

Clinical significance

The use of dietary supplements to maintain hydration has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality (17). There is evidence to suggest that high doses of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids may be harmful to our cardiovascular health and blood lipids. It is also possible that water soluble nutrients may interact with some of the important constituents of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated diets to increase the risk of adverse metabolic effects.

The association between hydration and cardiovascular risk in elderly individuals has been a source of controversy since early research failed to show an association between low arterial pressure (a sign of low hydration) and cardiovascular disease (18, 19). However, as the prevalence of arterial
