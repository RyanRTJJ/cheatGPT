 which result in disqualification are acts of cheating, fighting while blinded, and excessive time usage (over 32 minutes). In other circumstances, judges will only award points in the event of extreme negligence on the part of the competitor.

For the more aggressive fighters, the referees will use the traditional "fight to the finish" scoring system which gives an advantage to challengers who put their full effort into a fight. In addition, you will receive extra points whenever you have the least amount of points left when the ref announces a match is a draw. The winner of the match will receive 3 points for a win, 2 for a draw, and none for a loss. This system is known as the "Draw System."

If a fighter has the least amount of total points on their record then they are deemed unfit to continue and will be asked to compete again in the next fight. This would be similar to what happens in other mixed martial arts promotions where a fighter with the least amount of points is forced to lose a round to earn their way in.

Referees are also required to be familiar with the rules of UFC and in possession of a copy of the Unified Rules, which will be used at weigh ins for all UFC Fight Night matches.
