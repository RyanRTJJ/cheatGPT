He went on: "In addition, such hybridisation can occur in some situations and is not currently banned in our country.

"Our own records indicate a number of successful hybridisation attempts across recent years and, once breeding is completed, these can then cross and multiply in existing populations. It's not uncommon within our own breeding programme for several mixed offspring to compete for food and mates."

To date, just over a quarter of all wild horses across the UK have had their breeding population tested. If successful, more than 30,000 new and/or hybridised horses will be bred for sport in the British Isles.

There are currently 1,150 registered domestic and export animals living in Great Britain, but only 100 new horses are being produced each year, and just nine of those are breeding stock.

There are currently about 500 species of horses in Great Britain, but only 10 of them are bred for sport.

The National Horse Show in May will again see the country's horses featured at the highest award ceremony there will be in animal welfare history, in recognition of their remarkable and enduring heritage.

In order to encourage further development, a further 100 breeds of horse will begin to be evaluated as a way of improving animal welfare in the future.

However, the country also recently signed on to a draft agreement with the World Health Organisation banning commercial horse slaughter.

In an emailed statement, the Royal Horse and Burro Board said: "The Board understands that this announcement is important to the vast majority of UK owners and we recognise it as important to the conservation of many of these breeds."

"Our aim always has been to protect these breeds, and as long as we have, we will continue our drive to do so."

In an email to MailOnline, a representative of the National Horse Centre said the decision to ban all horses produced for sale from their range to breed the domestic breeding stock was "completely unacceptable" and a threat to their welfare.

"We would like to advise the public that while some breeders are looking to introduce this new policy
