udans today. Black and white are terms coined by historians, political movements, and the media in the West to describe the people of Bermuda. Many Bermudians do not share this view, and consider their black or white to be irrelevant to their being Bermudians. People from the African diaspora now make up the greatest proportion of Bermuda's population. According to a 2007 census (which has since been superseded), blacks represented 38.7% of the population (the figure dropped to 38.1% in 2012), while whites represented 35.8% (rising from 34.6% in 2007). There has been slight decline in the proportion of whites.

Etymology

The origin of the terms "black" and "white" in reference to the social makeup of Bermuda's population is unclear. "White" and "black" may have been used since Bermuda was first settled by Africans, who were called by other members of the community such as themselves. A popular account in the nineteenth Century, as seen by Frederick Thomas Gagarin, describes some individuals of African descent in Bermuda as of a "mixed or light-brown" complexion. However, a review of historical newspapers in Bermuda in 2004 suggests that "black" and "white" were not usually used outside the context of racial classifications. Racial categories in Bermuda may have been used by various political movements; some are now defunct.

Blacks

Historically, African Bermudians had little status within the community and their presence was primarily considered to be harmful to the society. At the turn of the twentieth century, some black Bermudians received citizenship, and one of the last to become naturalised (before 1898) was a man named George William Grant. According to the 1911 Census, in the population of Bermuda, 3.6% were Black, 7.6% were Indian, and 8% were Coloured. There were two black Bermudians named in the Bermuda Vital Statistics which reported them as mulatto.
