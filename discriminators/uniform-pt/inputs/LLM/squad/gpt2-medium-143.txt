 early days of the toy industry, the most popular type of record was probably produced in black plastic or cotton. Plastic record players of that day were typically large pieces of reinforced plastic with flat faces, with their handles at right angles and wide apart on the front. They were sometimes filled with magnets or other magnetic substances, but were typically unbroken except in the case of a record player with an external magnetic cable inside. In the late '40's, a special type of record-like device began to be produced. This device could be inserted into a compact or plastic storage area. It was normally inserted into a plastic bucket-shaped holder, then slid down into the record player and away from the record player, usually from the left-hand side. The records were then left where they were until they were removed from the storage unit. This type of record was called "flexible record" until about 1973, when the word "unbreakable" occurred with regard to these devices--and because the term flexible record began to be used, record players with flexible records appeared. By the mid-1960's, record players were becoming more closely modeled after their predecessors, and by the late '70's, record players had become essentially unbreakable. In this respect, the world record played was the world record in the late 1970's, and in 1977 is the world record in 1968. On July 11, 1980, the world record of 60,555 seconds was played. The record will be kept by the record company until its permanent status is determined (the company uses the mark number of 60,555 and then
