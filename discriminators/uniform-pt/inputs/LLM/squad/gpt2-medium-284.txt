, maintaining genetic integrity and allowing cell growth and division. The amount of energy required in a biological cell is called its mass, and the energy that is emitted as heat is called kinetic energy. The energy required per unit volume depends on the type of object a cell is made of, its type of growth and metabolic operation. The type of food, nutrition, and shelter it has is called the energy density of a particular organism. For most organisms, energy density is very low. For some, energetic density is about 1,000 kcal/kg/m^2 or 10% less than the standard energy density for an insect (5), which is about 1,260 kcal/kg/m^2, which is about 17% less than the standard energy density for a rat (36). The energy density of an organism depends on its structure and the species of organisms it lives in. The energy density of a certain kind of organism depends on its host species, which includes humans, the smallest vertebrate and the smallest invertebrate in the animal kingdom. The energy density of an organism, therefore, can be calculated from its mass and energy density. Energy density is expressed in Joules. Joules are units of mass per kilogram (kJ/kg). There is no unit that exists that can be applied to energy density, but there are also no units of energy.
