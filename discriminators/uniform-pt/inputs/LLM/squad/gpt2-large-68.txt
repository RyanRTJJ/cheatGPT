 between the cities of Berlin on the north and Leipzig on the south, and in 1933 the new M1 motorway on the west coast. The motorway network was built in stages – initially two motorways, then three, but by 1935, all roads were connected in one way or another through tunnels under the river. Each new section of road involved the construction of a new tunnel into the River Rhine. Although the tunnels are small – by the 1950s they will have covered some 40 km (25 mi) – they can be large enough to accommodate all the vehicles needed to carry people, supplies, freight and vehicles. Tunnel construction has been on a high tempo ever since, with some 100,000 people toiling underground in the 20-odd years that the Rhine motorway has been in service.

Although the German motorway network is impressive – more than 5,000 km (3,500 miles) long – it has some shortcomings – and most of these have been well known before the introduction of highways. The biggest drawback is the lack of parking (and, in recent years, traffic light systems and speed restriction signs) on both the road and tunnels. In cities like Leipzig and Dortmund, for example, parking is not only a problem, but can be a nightmare for those attempting to move around – especially on weekends. Furthermore, while there are some excellent parking facilities outside the major cities, the facilities are generally too limited to meet demand, as the city centre is rarely fully open. In a number of places in the city center, people park, walk
