 will be the Speaker of the House.

Mr Rudd acknowledged that "some people might see this as excessive in the light of history", but said it had become a matter of public interest that Ms Gillard had been stripped of the honour of the British throne as the former Prime Minister was not available to give an address.

"I've been told that many people are going to want to hear this speech and will be making a number of efforts to secure a copy of it, including those people and organisations that have been involved in the ongoing discussions over the past year," he said.

The Prime Minister welcomed the offer, saying: "I think it's very important that we honour the Queen and her responsibilities as head of the Commonwealth and the head of the Commonwealth Parliament."

The Prime Minister is currently in Malaysia for annual Chinese New Year celebrations and the Prime Minister's spokeswoman said she was unaware of the plans for Ms Gillard to address the annual event.

Ms Gillard will be attending Australia's state and territory elections at the start of July.
