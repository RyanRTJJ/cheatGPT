 Holy Roman Church's approval not only for a new doctrine but for the 'heresy' which was its means to achieve it. This is as likely in some quarters to make the Arians out to be merely innovators. It is however a very important question- who at the Council of Aachen saw 'heresy' as the instrument of his aim? How far did you consider the Arians as innovators?

'E. K. Newman, (Professor of Divinity, Oxford, 1876), while disagreeing vigorously with J. A. Sharples's contention that the Council at Aachen did not grant the 'heresy' title of supremacy to Nestorius, agrees that he was one who endeavoured to win a church council which had granted a different kind of supremacy, but one which was, he says, not granted under the authority of the Roman Pontiff. In this he is entirely correct, but does not follow the argument at all. In all he does and says we here see that a great deal of difference exists between J. A. Sharples and E. K. Newman, to which it must be added that Sharples does not say that he believes in the 'heresy' of Nestorius. He says simply that he does not consider the council as having been so granted. As far as we know there is no such matter in the Church history as that the Council of Aachen granted that the Arians had a heresies. We now believe that they had not.
