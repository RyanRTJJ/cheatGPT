 positions. The position on the right of the front-line, between St Quentin and the River Loire, had been fortified by the Germans and occupied by the German Army of the Loire led by the old Marshal Ney. When nightfall came, the cavalry were ordered to attack. The battle was a disaster. There was little support, no reserves, and confusion between the different attacking forces. Moreover, the new army corps were slow to arrive, and were then given orders for a frontal assault on the French position in an attempt to push the army forward.

For three hours the attack succeeded in driving the French out of positions between the villages of Serrant and Mâtaigné, but the French positions on the Loire were stubborn and the attacking force had to withdraw. This meant that the infantry, cavalry and artillery on the left wing could only attack up the River Seine. The army lost the opportunity to drive deep into the enemy's defences in an attempt to turn the French left flank. The infantry advanced in disorder to the river, but after crossing they became lost again in the darkness and the mud. There, once more, they ran into heavy shelling from the opposing artillery, and in particular, the 75mm guns. By 09:00 on 2 September they began to withdraw, leaving the infantry to fight their way upstream while the infantrymen fought in the fords around St Quentin. It
