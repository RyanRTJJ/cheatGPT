 gym, his dad suggested they get together, and the first "squat-pull-bench" barbell "got put down in front of me."

After being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, he realized early on that having his muscles stretched — either with exercises like leg extensions or dumbbell flyes or with the help of crutches — would not help him. He began to make himself sick. With the help of two different neurologists, he began using a type of medicine called "chronic activation therapy."

As "Chiropractor" on The Simpsons, Scott Aukerman learned what he calls, "I don't think it should be this extreme, but if the muscles are dead, what can ya do?

"If you think you need to pull out a muscle — especially while sleeping — do it in the mirror. Look at the muscle in the mirror, pull on it, let it go. That way you remember that it's dead."

After years of using the "chunking" method, with a group of 15 to 30 people, he turned it into a program of 30 to 45 minutes a day. Aukerman also incorporated other exercises to improve his balance and mobility, and he has a group of about 15 to 20 "dummy sets" to mimic what he did on The Simpsons, while he trains his wife, Kristina, to be able to work out.

"You have to get as close to Arnold as you can," Aukerman says. "You have to mimic his movements. You have to have a feel for it.

"By the time he passes away, we're gonna be able to show people pictures of how we trained his body."


Aukerman now has close to 15,000 supporters on Facebook, in part motivated by his love of weightlifting. Among the many testimonials he makes are about how he got to be a bodybuilder and what it must have been like to be a student at USC. His wife — Kristina — is a strength and conditioning coach herself.
