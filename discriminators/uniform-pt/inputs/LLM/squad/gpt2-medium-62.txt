 500 AD that took the form of a lengthy epic dealing with the beginnings of the world and the actions of the Roman emperor Nero. But when the poem was first written, the number of words, about 800, was considered low and even so, the text was not written down at the time until the second century AD. The first person to use the hexameter for written text was Virgil in AD 39, and the number of years between the first and 10th letters of the alphabet of Greek was 10, so its composition in 489 AD was completed around 6 AD. To be eligible as a member of the First Triad, the poet had to have been a poet or prose writer to the age and must have been born around 40: the most ancient of candidates would have been Homer, Hesiod and Philostratus.

However, despite the popular misconception about the early usage of the hexameter as a writing device, there exist other indications that the poet used the word in a way that was in perfect harmony with that of the time.

The first known mention of the word appears in the following two lines of Horace's Metamorphoses.

[Horace and a slave named Echidna]

were the slaves of Echido, and his wife Leda.

One morning, Echidna wrote a word that the other slaves did not read,

but this word became, as it were, a record:

they learned of their father that he had been sent.

And they said:

[Whosos?] who is that word, who had thought of giving it down

after we had forgotten all, who had taught us to write?

I am Echidna, I heard her say.

Echidna was like a daughter, as pure as a child:

like one whose youth has been a-prosperous.

And she was so fair, by nature so bright:

no body, no mind, no ear ever touched her nose,

and she read not a word except with her foot;

and at the word which they read to her,

they said the name of all the slaves

which they had brought
