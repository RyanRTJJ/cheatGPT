Conference history

Post-2000 changes
In 2001 and 2003, the NCC lost its three conference members for the 2001–2002 season as the North Coast Athletic Conference split into four conferences. For the 2004–2005 season, the conference was renamed as the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC).

In 2008, the two remaining conference members, the NCC and the Central New England Conference (CNE), merged to form the New England Collegiate Conference.

Conference rivalries

In recent years, the NCC has faced the NECCHS basketball, football, and wrestling teams as well as the NCAA Division II New England Small College Athletic Conference. 
The NCC is not considered a major college (that is, one with athletic scholarships) because the conference uses "community college" terminology, due to the level of the athletic programs the NCC sponsors.  The NCC is a member of the North Coast Athletic Association, a conference of mostly community colleges and public universities in Northern New England.  In the Northeast-10 conference, NCC teams play each other mostly in non-football sports. The NCC did play football in the NCAA once, when they joined the Colonial Athletic Association in 2005. The CAA did not sponsor football in 2005, but the NCC did play in non-football sports that year, the first time in school history they have played football games.
