 seat of the Imperial House of Qin Dynasty from 621 to 623 and during the period of Tang Dynasty, the great Zhou Dynasty. Since the late 7th to early 3rd Century, Nanjing has enjoyed a relatively peaceful and quiet existence, though its status has been contested in recent years through Chinese involvement in overseas wars. When Chinese troops invaded Manchuria in 1949, Nanjing was the immediate target for their assault by a number of Imperial Japanese forces. However, after heavy resistance from Nanjing-based units like the 13th Tank Army (7th Army), many Nanjing-based troops fell back into Manchuria. After the surrender in a decisive victory, Nanjing was allowed to return to China, although some Nanjing-based personnel were sent back to Japan. As of 1980, there were some 750 to 750 families and 800 families in Nanjing, though it had decreased by almost 50% since the 1960s. The majority of Nanjing households were based in the old city, but still remain in the city and are quite rich. There are almost as many families as old buildings in Nanjing but not all of the homes have been renovated yet. There are very few car dealerships in Nanjing. Most residents move to other areas to seek employment in their spare time or seek to protect their family. There are not many women in Nanjing, and many only have one. Due
