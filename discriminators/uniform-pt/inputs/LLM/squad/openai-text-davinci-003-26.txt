MCA made other alterations to the discs that affected their usability and lifespan. For instance, MCA replaced the original lacquer coating with a plastic coating that was more resilient to scratches and prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light. This coating also enabled a smoother playing surface and improved sound quality. The plastic coating also made molds easier to manufacture, which saved MCA and other companies money. Today’s vinyl records are still cut from MCA-made molds.

In the 1950s, MCA branched out from record production to moviemaking. The label had already enjoyed a great success with its Universal Studios Theme Park, but wanted to expand its reach into full-length feature films. MCA’s efforts paid off with hits like Animal House (1978) and E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982).

MCA also diversified into book and magazine publications, television, and music production. Today, MCA is part of the Universal Music Group, which is one of the world’s largest music companies. MCA continues to be a major player in the music industry, producing soundtracks and albums for major artists both domestically and internationally.
