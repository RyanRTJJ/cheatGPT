ith appointments usually going to Manchu noble families. After 1636, Han Chinese officials had to be recommended by Manchu princes, who were given exclusive appointments to virtually all government offices. 

Behind the fa√ßade of an empire in which Han Chinese held high positions, the important positions were reserved for Manchus. Chinese were not allowed to learn the Manchu language and were treated as illiterates if they did not know the language. All laws and court proceedings were conducted in Manchu, further disadvantaging the Han Chinese, who were not allowed to participate in government proceedings. 

The Han Chinese were, however, allowed extensive access to lower and middle positions in the government bureaucracy, and those who rose to the highest positions such as military commanders and governors of provinces were typically former Ming military generals who had been won over to the Qing cause. After 1644, all high-ranking Manchu military posts were filled by Manchu eight banners.

Maintaining their equity thus required the Qing to protect their identity and Manchu rights. As a result, various measures were taken to ensure that Manchus remain a distinct ethnic identity. The Qing enacted laws that prohibited Han Chinese from marrying Manchu women and banned Han Chinese from purchasing Manchu land. The government also created schools that taught Manchu and provided exclusive military posts to Manchus in order to maintain their dominance over Han Chinese.
