Strict separation of powers to operate in the UK would mean that the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government operate independently of one another without any interaction whatsoever. This is not the case in the UK, where all three branches of government–the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary–are closely intertwined with one another.

In the UK, the Prime Minister (who is part of the executive) has considerable influence over the legislature, while members of the legislature, such as the Speaker of the House of Commons, are often appointed to the executive. In terms of the judiciary, it is the Prime Minister who is responsible for selecting the members of the judiciary, though this is done in consultation with the judiciary itself.

The lack of strict separation of powers in the country means that it is possible for the executive to override the decisions of the legislature and the judiciary if a matter is considered to be of national interest or importance. This has been illustrated in particular with the passing of the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, which granted sweeping surveillance powers to the executive.

In the United States, however, the Founding Fathers used the concept of separation of powers to create a much stricter separation between the three branches of government. This system of separation of powers has been enshrined in the Constitution, and it is something that is closely adhered to today.
