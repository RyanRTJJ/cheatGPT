udians, a result of four centuries of immigration, intermarriage, and slavery, during the colonial period.

The earliest inhabitants of Bermuda were likely the Taino Indians, who populated the islands in the 16th century. These native people, who had come to Bermuda from the nearby Bahama islands, would have been wiped out by early settler activity. The first large population influx to the British colony of Bermuda was made up primarily of indentured servants from England and Wales, followed by an influx of African slaves that arrived in the 17th century. By the end of the 18th century, the population of Bermuda had grown to about 8,000 and consisted of Europeans, West Indians, and Africans.

In the early 19th century, waves of settlers from Europe, North America and the Caribbean arrived. The largest group was the Irish, who arrived in the 1840s. Over time, the various ethnicities intermarried and the distinctions between them became increasingly blurry.

Today, due to the effects of centuries of immigration and intermarriage, the predominant ethnicity in Bermuda is a mix of European, African, and Caribbean descent, with the majority of the population being of British and West Indian ancestry. There is no other distinct ethnic group in Bermuda today.
