 Chopin began to meet the people of Marseilles. According to Hiller, a "very polite" man by the name of Paul Sartiau, who met Chopin during his stay in Aix, was able to convince the two to take a trip to France to visit Montmartre, one of Paris's most prominent and historical buildings. The trip began on March 29, 1834, and the two musicians walked four days through the city, ending the day of their arrival with a concert in the courtyard of the Hotel de Baudouin where they were greeted by a crowd of people.

After a two-day stop at La Fleche, Chopin and Hiller made their way to the Place de la Concorde, where they made a stop at Châtelet to see the great works of Raffaello Sanzio. It was during this stop at Châtelet that Chopin made his last visit to Paris. Chopin visited the Palais-Royal museum on April 2 to see "Swan Lake," a painting by Le Jeune Saint-Louis. After his visit to Baudouin, Chopin went to Versailles to study "the works of Jean-Paul Marat," which he studied by copying his portrait.

Chopin and Hiller visited the Salon des 18 Jours on May 2, and later that month, Chopin stayed in the Hotel de Rennes, where they played and hung out in the restaurant between the 18th and 19th Jours, spending ten weeks during this time. On June 21, Chopin took a tour of Paris with Hiller, but they stayed at Fontainebleau that night so that Chopin could study Michelangelo at a famous school. By the end of the summer, Chopin was already deep in preparation for what he knew was his greatest painting, "The Maids of St. Germain."
