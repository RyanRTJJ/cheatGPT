In July 2011, the United States Congress voted to rename the US Highway 101 to the "Thomas Jefferson Memorial Highway". The vote passed unanimously in the House of Representatives after passing in the U.S. Senate on May 20, 2011.

The final torch run is planned for July 4 in Charlottesville, Virginia near the "Mother Mary of Mehoopany" shrine, one of the sites of a violent white nationalist protest that led to the deaths of three civil rights volunteers. The Charlottesville route follows the same path as that which was used for the 1996 torch relay and will pass by Lee Park where four students from Virginia Tech were gunned down in April 2007, at the University of Virginia's Thomas Jefferson Library where the University Archivist hung an upside-down American Flag and burned it in the library grounds, and at the Rotunda of the University of Virginia, where a large portion of the students protesting the events that occurred at the Virginia Tech shooting were arrested. The first torch run was held in 1980.

Torch relays are held for a day in each state that participates, and the torch is typically raised in front of the capitol building of the state in which it is held. Sometimes, a state hosts the relay for two states, and the two states form a "double torch relay".
