 where the Amazon River flows its course, has more bacteria at its surface than Brazil and other tropical countries with large inland rivers.

These diverging biological systems are connected, however, by a very complex ecological feedback system of life, where natural processes such as evolution, disturbance and climate influence the extent to which certain microorganisms exist on the microscopic level and in the organisms. In addition, species such as Archaea, Proteobacteria, Archaea (formerly Cyprinaceae and Coccinellales, now mostly Pachycephalosporales) that are highly susceptible to selection may survive, while those with different resistance may decimate.

The microbiontical system is then further connected to those factors affecting crop yield - the use of pesticides, genetic modification, changes in climate. This includes the relationship between biodiversity and plant growth and physiology.

The research has implications for agriculture, farming practices and the global ecological system, as researchers are attempting to identify the environmental factors that explain the different outcomes on different crops.

Dr Michael Green, lead author from Oxford's Department of Earth Sciences said: "If the ecological factors that explain the genetic variations between species have not been accounted for then we all are at considerable risk of losing the natural and cultural context of our own native ecosystems."
