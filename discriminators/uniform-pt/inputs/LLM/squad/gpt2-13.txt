 might be the signature of hair and skin color within a race, and light-brown hair does not normally lead to body hair.

However, there appear to be differences in how hair and skin look.

"Our results show that hair color does not matter in the 'predecessor' allele," says Dr. William H. Smith, a geneticist and co-author of the study. "This suggests we should not just change our behavior to match their behavioral patterns; we need to match their genomic DNA."

In other words, if a hair color is an adaptive trait, and we have learned to adapt to that trait, then the behavioral traits of our ancestors have changed too.

"I think the way we think about skin color, you see how different skin colors and some of the common hair colors are at all times," Dr. Smith says.

In other words, the behavioral adaptations to different skin colors are more adaptive, and less unique, depending on how many more mutations we've accumulated over time.

"But, if you consider this from a scientific perspective, what might be more interesting to us is that more genes could contribute to changing skin color, and if so, how do we develop that gene pool now?" he adds. "What could we possibly do to stop that, because that might explain it in much the same way that we do it now or at a far lower cost."

That would allow us to create adaptive traits on our own that can be shared across many ancestries. For example, hair is associated with more social status than is skin color.

However, we are still able to recognize and recognize hair from other populations. The only issue is that as human human beings we do not have the
