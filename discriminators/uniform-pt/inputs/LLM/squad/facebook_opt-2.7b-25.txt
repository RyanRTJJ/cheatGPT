 global economic development trend and has achieved remarkable development in these industrial clusters.

Most products manufactured on a large scale in Zhejiang are exported to neighboring countries and are very profitable. However, the industry has not been able to move forward in the past 20 years. The quality of products has been maintained in Zhejiang but it is difficult to move at an international competitive level due to backwardness, low technologies and low development capacity.

The industry has focused on products in electrical appliances and industrial equipment, and is therefore concentrated in Zhejiang. As a result, the industry has missed the market trend in global economies and become stagnant.

Consequently, China has to rely on the rest of the world for imports. More and more products are manufactured and assembled in China and then exported to the rest of the world. But the current trend will lead to a decrease in quality and a serious deterioration in the international market position of the country.

The objective of this Project:

To enhance the competitiveness of Chinese manufacturers by improving their technical capacity and technological capability.

To give them a better market position in the world market.

To create new markets for the products in China, particularly in the West, which will lead to the development of new products and services.

To reduce the cost and shorten the time of development of the products and services.

To raise the quality and reduce time-to-market of the products
