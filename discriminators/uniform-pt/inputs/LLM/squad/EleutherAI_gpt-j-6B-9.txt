000 ft2) of internal floorspace within a building envelope of about 1,500,000 m2 (1,800,000 ft2)[6]. It is believed that it has been inhabited since approximately 4000 BC, possibly since the time of the Sumerians, due to its close proximity to the ancient site of Eridu.[7] It is located 15 km (9.3 mph) northeast of Babylon, 100 km (62.1 mph) south of Baghdad, Iraq, on the edge of an irrigated plain.[8]

The complex consists of various architectural buildings and structures that are arranged in two clusters. The outer cluster, which originally housed a city in its entirety, is located around a larger rectangular platform and is subdivided internally into several precincts. According to archaeologists, this outer cluster likely served as a large civic quarter with a central market, a residential area and the palace.[citation needed]
The inner cluster may have been the site of residences and religious rituals. The site is located in a small isolated oasis set in the arid steppe of Lower Mesopotamia.[6] It is surrounded by large sandstone cliffs whose top are over 150 metres above sea level. The palace is built on the crest of a hill, and thus is entirely hidden from sight except from a distance, particularly by an adjoining ridge of lower height.

The inner cluster in turn was surrounded by a second smaller palatial area, located within the cliffs, and was itself surrounded by an outer city. The two clusters can be compared with certain pre-modern urban plans, where the
