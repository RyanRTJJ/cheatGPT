 two and each of the two subcontinents — Laurasia and Gondwana — split apart approximately 100 million years later. (A diagram of the splitting of supercontinent Pangaea by the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary is shown left; broken line from right corresponds to age.)

In terms of geologic time, much of the earliest Jurassic was lost as the collision of the supercontinent Pangaea with and breakup of Gondwana. During this period, Earth’s crust became less dense and Earth’s gravity weakened. Earth’s interior heated and the climate changed, and in the early Jurassic, the entire southern hemisphere received a massive dose of heat from the Sun.

Earth’s largest continent – Laurasia – and its supercontinent, Gondwana, were split apart at the end of the Late Jurassic and the beginning of the Early Cretaceous. Geological evidence suggests these changes occurred during the late Triassic or early Jurassic. The Late Jurassic begins about 201 million years ago and the Early Cretaceous begins about 145 million years ago. Although the Jurassic Period stretches from 201 to 145 million years ago, many dinosaurs appear early in the Late Jurassic, when the continents are still fused and there is no substantial evidence of separation.

In the Late Jurassic, Laurasia, Gondwana, and Africa – all located at different locations in the southern hemisphere – are joined together forming Pangaea. This continental formation lasted for approximately 200 million years. Although the continents and continents are
