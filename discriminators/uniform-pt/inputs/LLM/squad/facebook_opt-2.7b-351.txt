 Power(trademark) 200 system developed by Solar Systems of Santa Clara County, Calif. The Solar Total Power(trademark) 200 is a parabolic dish concentrating system. It is designed to provide approximately 10% of a power system""s heat to a boiler. The Solar Power(trademark) 200 system offers an open-loop control system that uses a feedwater temperature control system to control the temperature of the feedwater flowing through the solar concentrating system.
In a commercial solar concentrator, the concentration of the feedwater temperature and the power generated by the concentrator may be compared with the power generated from the base system. Based on performance characteristics and efficiency of the concentrator, a system can be designed for a maximum efficiency at a certain temperature with respect to the base system. It is desirable to be able to design the solar concentrator so that each concentration point has a high output power ratio with respect to the total power generated by the solar concentrator. Such a system allows for a reduction in size and an increase in power density with respect to the amount of power consumed.
To maintain a high ratio of power output to quantity of feedwater used, it is necessary to deliver more power to the solar concentrator than is consumed in the power plant""s base system. In order to provide the required power without increasing the amount of feedwater, it is necessary to feed additional heat back to the power plant""s base system. This increases the temperature of the feedwater and therefore requires more power
