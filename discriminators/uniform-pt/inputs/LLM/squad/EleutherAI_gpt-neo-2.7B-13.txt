 is present in the majority of animals. To understand how light anddark color variation, and whether an organism maintains or loses pigmentation, requires an examination of the mechanism of hair pigmentation, eumelanogenesis, in general and the biochemical changes occurring in hair cells which influence coloration. Eumelanin is a melanin pigment found in the hair cells and keratinocytes of many diverse species. In both vertebrate and invertebrate systems, melanin pigmentation plays an important role in controlling a number of characteristics from animal movement, to insect and bird colors. In mammals, two types of melanosomes arise from hair cell melanocytes and the dendrites containing the secretory granules of the Langerhans cells. The melanin granules are located in the inner and outer hair cells and provide the signal for normal hair cell development and function. Eumelanogenesis is a multistep process beginning with melanin synthesis by melanocytes, followed by its transport to and accumulation in hair cells. The last step of eumelanin synthesis in the hair cells takes place in the Golgi apparatus and results in the formation of melanosomes. This pigment accumulates in the lumen of hair cells and in the keratin fibers of other cells in the skin and in the skin appendages.

2. The Organism: Mammals {#sec2-2}
========================

The pigmentations on mammals are due to a specific pigmentation in hair, hair follicles, teeth and nails, skin, hair, eyelashes, sweat glands, feathers, sebaceous glands, and hair and body covering other tissues like muscles, tendons, organs, blood vessels, and heart valves. The pigment of mammalian hair has been extensively studied and its role in color variation and hair-growth patterns, has been analyzed in great detail. The pigments in hair fall under the umbrella of melanins which include pheomelanins and
