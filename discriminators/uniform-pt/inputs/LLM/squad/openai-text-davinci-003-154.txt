 Project (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia in the late 1980s.

The greatest advantage of these systems is their ability to concentrate a large area of sunlight onto a small area, producing high temperatures of up to 1000°C and making them ideal for heating applications such as steam for power generation. By concentrating the sun’s energy, these systems can provide energy at a much lower cost than conventional systems, especially when fuel costs are high.

Solar concentrating technologies are being used around the world in a range of applications such as water heating, space heating, solar process heat, and solar cooling. In addition, they are a popular choice for remote and off-grid locations where access to electrical grid or fuels is limited. This type of technology is becoming increasingly popular as the cost of solar panels and components continues to decrease. 

Solar concentrating technologies are relatively simple and efficient in their design, and offer a low cost, easily scalable option for renewable energy applications. However, they do come with some downsides. As they rely on direct sunlight, they can only generate power during the day, and they require a large area for installation. Additionally, due to their highly reflective surfaces, they can cause glare and interfere with aircraft navigation.
