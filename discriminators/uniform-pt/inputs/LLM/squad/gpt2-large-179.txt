 competitive. In 2001, Intel was outmatched by Intel's more powerful FPGAs, including AMD's x86. But the threat was there, and the battle continues today. (Apple has since introduced its own x86-based Mac line of computers.) The challenge with ARM chips is that they require manufacturers to make them more or less equally compatible with their Intel counterparts. In 2003, for instance, Intel introduced the Atom processor, which provides much smaller and faster processing power than other ARM chips. ARM's primary rival, Qualcomm, has also made the transition to using ARM chips for Android phones. So while Intel was outmatched by ARM competition, the situation was actually pretty darn favorable for the consumer electronics industry--at least if one takes ARM's competitors at face value. To illustrate this point, consider the number of smartphone makers in the United States: Samsung sold about 45 million iPhones and Android phones last year, far more than any other handset maker. Apple sold only 5 million iPhone handsets last year, and its iPad tablet accounted for just over half that number--not to mention its Mac-only iMac. And even though this is only the second consecutive year that Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPads, the company has sold just under 6 billion iPads around the world, which works out to an astounding 1 billion Apple users in more than 200 markets. Since the iPhone 4/4s was designed to run the newest version of iOS, the iPhone 5 has been an all-day-over-all computing powerhouse. Although Apple's competitors now make "ultra-high end" tablets, the overall cost of running Android is a fraction of Apple's. Apple only had to make a smaller or less powerful version of Android than
