In his recently published book, The New Critical Aesthetics: Theoretical Criticism in the British Nineteenth Century (Princeton UP, $35), historian Samuel Johnson argues that the New Critical movement began in response to the liberal reformist movements that dominated the British literary establishment since about 1830. The book is a valuable study of early nineteenth-century literature, especially Dickens, Thackeray, Thayer, and Scott. In addition, it reveals the tensions between these movements and the liberal reformist traditions, which still shape many intellectual institutions in Britain, in particular the university system, and its students.[1]
