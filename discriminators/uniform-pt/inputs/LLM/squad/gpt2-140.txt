 average score of 18.6 points lower than their peers.

The National Bureau of Economic Research said it was "very likely that higher class sizes" led to a significant increase in the share of student's students performing better in the class grades.

It said that even though grade inflation was less intense when class size was larger, this may not have been the case in the past.

It said that students on average had a grade of 18.6 points higher at top classes, or more than 50 per cent below their counterparts on average.

The average difference in class size at every level of education, from primary to secondary, took a huge hit in this case and a number of experts questioned its validity.

In the past, the maths school student who first performed higher-status mathematics at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, who also happens to be at the Institute of Mathematics in Lillenwald of Switzerland, had an average score of 15.3 in a class of 22.1.

And even before its arrival in 1992, a group of researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Engineering and Technology in Cambridge, the Institute of Physics, Cambridge, the Institute of Applied Physics and Chemical Physics in Cambridge, the University of Cambridge, the Max Planck Institute for Mathematical Statistics and the University of Bonn, Germany, were analysing data showing that
