The new way of handling apps was demonstrated by Microsoft at its Build conference earlier today. The company's Joe Belfiore said that developers have until October 25 to get their apps up and running on the preview build of Windows 8 before the OS launches to all users this fall. He confirmed that Windows 8 will be getting a "lightning" beta test before launch on Windows Phone and the PC in November.

The tech site cited anonymous sources that claim the new OS could get delayed until January 2013 at the earliest.
