 of revolution.... It has fallen to me with great pleasure to quote and give a very large proportion of his remarks to you."

Burgess is correct that Burke was the first conservative to write a polemic against the new religion of Progressivism: In Burke's view, "the church of progress ought to be the only one that is left of the Church of Christ.... The church that rests with itself was founded by a Christian who desired to know it, and to know him he must be guided by the revelations given him by the Father of Lights."1

Yet Burke's most influential arguments against Progressivism are the kinds that he was most likely also making. He was not an enemy of the establishment, but he also believed in the capacity of political elites. In the 1780s as part of his intellectual evolution he also believed that social justice — whether for Jews or for anyone else — would come from the public sphere.

The first such argument Burke used was that "every one who takes the place formerly taken by the public and in some distant place in society" is just as important as the one who "places himself at the head of society for a short period of time."2 He saw that for public good, "the best way of being free and secure is by the public's taking every advantage that they have, under the pretext of the welfare of the public; that is, the best of all means is the public taking what is rightfully theirs as well."3 Burke also believed that "every one can rise to the position necessary to bestow public honour, when the people choose their own governors."4 On this Burke often believed that power should not be handed to the rulers but be given back to the people who elected them. And when he called for reforms by means of "the people's legislative bodies,"5 Burke, a close friend of the radical French philosophes who influenced Burke, believed that those who would succeed the reformers were "the people themselves."

The second case Burke made for Progressivism was for the establishment as a tool by which to restore order. The ideal he proposed was that order should be maintained
