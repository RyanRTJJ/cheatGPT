 Race and Race Theory." It's well worth reading in its entirety. However, at one point they point, among other things, to the apparent success of the "southern strategy" to fight back against the idea of "race-as-differences" (hereafter "race-as-differences"). In particular, they point to the failure of African Americans to "prove" their "white privilege" and the apparent success of the "white pride" movement to counter the notion that white people are "white" by virtue of "whiteness" — at least when they're talking about how far away they are supposed to be, or they're talking about who they are supposedly being compared to.

I can understand their use of evidence; it's their job after all — but they tend to ignore another data point in the same data set. It's that fact that all of the "fertile" African American children who were given FST were also given genetic tests for "intelligence" and "emotionality," in addition to taking standard American ethnic surveys. I wonder what would happen if the "fertile" African American children who were given FST also took a genetic test for their "intelligence" and "emotionality" and compared it against their results from the standard American survey?

A lot more black kids would have IQ scores of 200 and above, and less emotional problems. That's not exactly what they wanted, and so instead they made up some other story that the "diversity"-fomenting Southern Strategy really turned around black kids' IQ and emotional problems (as if they weren't already low before all this). It makes less and less sense the further you dig, but that's par for the course with people like Jeffries Long and Rick Kittles.

But it does take another element of the "debate" that is being perpetuated by the "southern strategists" seriously out of balance. I'm sure that they
