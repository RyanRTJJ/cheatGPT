, arranged the recording by a British label, and a UK version ("Fairytale In London") soon followed. On 7 November 1958 the single was issued in America by Columbia. In Germany, where Columbia had a partnership with Deutsche Grammophon for vinyl record importation, it was released by the label of the Deutsche Grammophon group that Mercury had founded in 1946. The release received critical acclaim. The single became, for the most part, the single of the 1960s, and became Mercury's best-selling single, to date. In the UK, it was also covered on The Part Time Players and many other records. Some early early American releases included a German single in the same month (on 3 December 1958) and a US version (on 8 January 1959), both of which had the British singles released with them. Also in the early months of 1959 a British Columbia label released Columbia's own version of "Bohemian Rhapsody', and an alternate German release (with an unusual title: "Ausgabe von Franz-Hermann-Hildebrist", abbreviated to "Hildeburg"). Other issues are not known, but they did contain another single: a British Columbia release also without "Fairytale" on the title page. "Fairytale" is thought to be the best-selling single of the decade, not just of Mercury's career.

Only a few of the lines by Mercury in "Fairytale" can be related to what Mercury says during the "Bohemian Rhapsody" recording (that he "just wanted to get married in a fairy tale" and "I'm no better than you"), but this makes what is essentially a German-language album recording for the British Columbia label very unusual. It is not unusual that there are British Columbia labels that are not quite consistent as to what is being covered. The most notable are the ones that had a record with an unknown "Fairytale In London" track instead of "Bohemian Rhapsody", but on
