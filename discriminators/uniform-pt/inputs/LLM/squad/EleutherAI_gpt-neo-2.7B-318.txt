 to leadership in the last days of the Armenian Genocide. The history of the Armenian diaspora will be the subject of a separate chapter in this book, but in the meantime let us examine the effects of the Genocide in a slightly more localised setting. It is here that the story begins of a group of Armenians who lived in Konya, a city north of Istanbul in the Ottoman Empire.

“In order to understand the Armenian situation and why it happened, it is necessary to look at how and why the Armenian population suffered at the hands of Hitler’s Germany, and the Armenians in particular.”

The genocide has been described as the “institution and instrumentality of an ethnic cleansing policy”. As such, it forms a unique and indelible part of the history of modern genocide. The most infamous case of the Armenian Genocide is that of the Armenian genocide that took place in 1915 during World War I. The events that came to be commonly known as the Armenian Genocide are a tragic, ongoing tragedy in the United States of America and Armenian diaspora that still continues today. The Armenian genocide occurred between the years of 1915 and 1917 in the Ottoman Empire, which, at the time, was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which later became the Republic of Turkey. This was also a period when the Ottoman Empire was still a global power with its own foreign policy and imperialistic ambitions. The first thing to acknowledge is that the events of 1915 took place, what is known as the Armenian Holocaust, in a part of the world that was under military occupation since the late 1800s. This fact can be seen in the fact that the Armenian deportation took place from the city of Yedikule, one of the largest Christian towns in the city of Konya.
