The American Space Exploration Act, signed into law by President Kennedy on June 28, 1960, authorized the President to place astronauts in space. In 1961, NASA launched a pair of lunar landers and a craft, called the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, into lunar orbit around the Moon. These missions provided valuable data to inform NASA's continuing exploration of the Moon's surface. NASA provided funding for manned space flights for the next few years, culminating in the Apollo moon landings in November, 1972, and the Apollo 13 mission in December, 1972, which took three astronauts on the first manned landing on the Moon. During this time, two other missions were launched to test the technologies used on manned missions, the Apollo-Soyuz testing program and lunar lander missions. The Apollo 13 Moon lander and the Apollo-Soyuz test mission set up the lunar landing site at the Sea of Tranquility, on the far side of the Moon's permanently shadowed south pole. Following these tests, two more landers were placed
