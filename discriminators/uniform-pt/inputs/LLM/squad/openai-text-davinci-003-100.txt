 the southern powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 by the Deccan sultanates. During its rule, the empire was characterised by an efficient and highly centralised administration connecting a diverse collection of territorial entities.

The Empire was built by a proactive regional military and administrative structure, characterised by innovative military tactics, a well-developed revenue administration and vast improvement in socio-economic, religious and cultural aspects during its rule. The Vijayanagara armies expelled Islamic sultanates from the Deccan Plateau and penetrated deep into South India, conquering territory from the present-day Telangana, North Karnataka and Mysore Plains, extending their rule up the Godavari and Krishna valleys and across the entire Deccan region.

During its rule, the Empire had accomplished a great deal. It was responsible for the revitalization of Hinduism, which had been in a decline since the 8th century, and it initiated the first era of native public administration in South India. The Empire also promoted trade and commerce and developed a number of ports along the coast of South India, including ones in Mailapur (Hampi), Panaikayal (Vellore), and Nagapattinam (Kodikarai). In cultural aspects, the Empire was highly influential and celebrated for its architecture, sculpture, literature, and painting. The Vijayanagara Empire-sponsored Dravidian architectural and artistic styles that became popular across Southern India.
