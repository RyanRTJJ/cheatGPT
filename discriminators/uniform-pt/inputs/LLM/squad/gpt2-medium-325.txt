The majority of American soldiers receive the language of their country; one exception is French.

The default is 'the' language they're exposed to.

There are some exceptions such as the Vietnamese language, and even English for some people.

The primary language of the European-style English language, with no English equivalent, is 'C' for 'Count'.

I'll get you, I'll do whatever you wanted you to do (even do it with a little pain, if it works well), so you'll still be working through the pain and frustration of language. (I know we're all not so bad right?).

A word to add to the mix, in case you want to add further variation: the default is not always a good one.

We use the default language only at formal events like wedding anniversaries and family reunifications, and sometimes only at other times when we get the chance to say the local word to people we happen to want to speak to. We don't go to our dinner party without this option, or we don't go to parties that don't have this option. If you give us the choice to use either or both languages, it's often for the best.

While we do use the default for almost every occasion, here is what we do consider the most likely:
