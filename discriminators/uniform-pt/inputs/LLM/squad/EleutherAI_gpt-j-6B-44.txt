 and dinosaurs may have had a higher tolerance for anoxia (lack of oxygen) than have humans. In this way, humans would be able to breath better in an anoxic environment.

The following video shows a number of bird species (along with their extinct dinosaur kin) that have been recorded to have been able to withstand anoxic conditions and for periods that may have actually been longer. It shows their ability to get to air. This is based on several publications.

The following video is a compilation of the many videos on birds in anoxic conditions; however, this video does not tell everything about how birds and dinosaurs lived and died.

While many dinosaurs didn't go extinct immediately after the asteroid (or comets as some would suspect) struck the earth millions of years ago, some dinosaurs did go extinct. One that lived and died right around that time was the species known as the Stegosaurus. The Stegosaurus was a dinosaur that was quite common on the Western Hemisphere. They lived on land; there is much debate as to whether the Stegosaurus was completely bipedal as some maintain (which would make it completely terrestrial) or was a biped that was able to run as fast as it walked.

The Stegosaurus is often mistaken for a theropod dinosaur; however, they were actually reptiles belonging to the order of the Sauropsida. Many of the dinosaurs belong to the order the Theropoda as well as the Ornithischia, but the former group have been found to have a more primitive relationship with other Sauropoda than those of the
