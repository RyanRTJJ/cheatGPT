, and in December 1864, the U.S. began a state-recognized Native American Movement, calling themselves the Montana Mountain Movement. A large number of students joined the Mountain Movement and attended activities and meetings on the land between 1884 and 1891, according to various sources. Several organizations became active in Montana during this period, including the National Association of American Farmers (NAFE), the Montanea Paiute and Mountain Association.

The United Mine Workers fought aggressively against mining in the mines, starting a war with the Southern Mining Company in 1884. The U.S. Congress held an action in July 1885, and soon after established the Montana Mines in which the companies moved to Idaho, Kansas and Nebraska by May 1897. The Powder River mine was the largest on the land. In the spring of 1861, the miners were driven out of the mine by strong winds and lightning strikes.

However, the miners and their supporters were killed in the strike.

In January 1887, the Montana Mining Board attempted to withdraw the mining force. Despite efforts, the board could not withdraw the force.
