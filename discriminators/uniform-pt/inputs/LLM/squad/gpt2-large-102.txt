, and in December of that year, the first law was passed. It was created to establish the first school, and to prohibit the use of private and religious property for prayer. It was amended on February 25, 1869, to include free and compulsory education, and the same act required that the first law be followed.

During the next ten years, the students in Montana were not taught the curriculum laid down by the federal authorities. They learned mostly from their own teachers—not from the U.S. government, which used its own teachers to educate its own children. This forced students into making what some called a "self-directed education." A new school was established on April 12, 1873, just five days after the state legislature passed the first law.

After the Civil War, many Western states passed laws allowing schools, churches, and state employees to celebrate "holy days" or "holy days of obligation" in the schools, and many continued to do so in the post-Civil War period.
