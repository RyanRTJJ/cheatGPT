Gameplay

The game contains many of the mechanics that make up the base-on-the-ground "traditional" Zelda dungeons, including regular doors, ladders, and platforms, and an unusual emphasis on collecting Rupees as an optional collectible. The dungeons are designed to make playing through them quicker than the original game â€” as with The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, the rooms are interconnected by small, easily discovered secrets.

As the name implies, Twilight Princess is not based on any specific Zelda in the series. Nevertheless, a number of items, enemies and structures take their cues from the Legend Of Zelda series, and Twilight Princess contains numerous references in its script and the layout of the map, such as the location of the original entrance to Gerudo Desert. However, much of the game's story and characters are completely original, while the setting itself has been altered from the original game, but not significantly.

The most noticeable visual change between the two versions of Twilight Princess is that, while the dungeons of Twilight Princess are now designed to be smaller and smaller, the dungeons themselves are larger and, usually, wider.
