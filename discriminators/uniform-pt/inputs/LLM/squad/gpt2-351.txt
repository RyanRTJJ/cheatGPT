 Conversion Device made for use on the power grid of California. The device produces an energy source equal to those of a single photovoltaic-based power generator. A parabolic dish in which a large portion of the energy is converted to thermal energy has shown great promise for its use in a variety of applications.

In 2006, when the American Petroleum Institute (API) was launching the second phase of the New Energy Economy with Solar, the DOE announced that they were planning to begin charging existing customers with 100% solar power and would add the ability for the DOE to charge customers with 100% renewable energy by 2015. The new DOE Program will support solar energy investment in large residential and commercial projects and will establish new renewable energy sources and a growing portfolio of sources for all levels of generation. This DOE-sponsored initiative includes the development of a portfolio of highly cost-effective technologies through the new Solar total energy conversion device, which combines parabolic dish energy storage technologies (tetrahedron-as-energy (VAE) with parabolic dish), trough-chatter and trough-heated power production. Solar PV is the most commercially available energy source at the current scale and has a global market valuation of as much as US$2 billion. With this program, the DOE will be able to charge customers (and all their customers) 100% renewable energy and have the ability to purchase more renewable energy via an EMER. This technology includes both a large solar PV array system and a parabolic dish system (which is about
