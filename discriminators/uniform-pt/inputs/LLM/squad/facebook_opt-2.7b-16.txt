stress system (in humans and primates, in a more general sense).

The stress system consists of multiple components:

1. The neuroendocrine mechanisms,

2. The nervous system mechanisms,

3. The physical/biological mechanisms,

4. The social mechanisms.

1. Neuroendocrine

The stress system also includes neuroendocrine and immune systems (for humans, it is the endocrine system). The stress system can be divided into four sub-systems, which differ in the processes they influence:

1. sympathetic

2. parasympathetic

3. autonomic

4. endocrine

1. Sympathetic Stress Mechanisms

The sympathetic nervous system is active in response to various events that provoke and are expected to cause stress (like a threatening animal, a hostile situation, an alarm (like a fire alarm) or a threat of attack from another person). The sympathetic nervous system has its origin in the pituitary gland. It is activated by stress hormones and leads to increased heart rate/beat and blood pressure, sweating, increased metabolism and so on. Also, the sympathetic nervous system is involved in the fight or flight response. The stress hormones play a role in inducing sympathetic response as well as in triggering sympathetic and parasympathetic counter-reactions. These two systems are closely related due to the same basic effects.

The sympathetic system is a dynamic system and there are some situations that can disrupt the neuroendocrine mechanisms of the sympathetic nervous system. The response in the sympathetic nervous system is mainly the increase of blood pressure, heart rate, sweating of the skin, an increased release of adrenaline in the adrenal glands. The result is that the sympathetic nervous system is at a high output. These mechanisms include a response that involves both sympathetic nerves and adrenal glands, which causes increased secretion of cortisol, an alkaloid that is a stress hormone
