But in an unprecedented move, a new study from the University of Chicago published a December 13 study, by researchers from Harvard University and UCLA, shows an unprecedented rise in China's youth suicides in recent years.

The research found a nearly 40 per cent jump in suicides among Chinese men with two or more children within the last decade. Among other things, young men and women with two or more children were twice as likely to
