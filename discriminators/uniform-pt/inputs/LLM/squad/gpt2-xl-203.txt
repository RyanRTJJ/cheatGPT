 range at K'angchun as a second infantry division. The Japanese were now in the open with a clear view of Chinese divisions to the north. General Wainright, who was with the 7th Division, was ordered to halt and await further relief.

The 2nd Chinese Infantry Division advanced about 300 yards into the hills around the city. However, they were surrounded, so they withdrew into the hills again. The Chinese 6th Division, with its 3rd Tank Division, advanced northeast through the K'angchun area, then east to the Shao-chow line. On 6 June the Chinese 39th Division advanced into a gap between the 7th and 9th Divisions. The Japanese were now out of the fight, while the main Chinese offensive continued. The 3rd Division had moved northward over the hills and in K'angchun City to a position within 20 miles before running into a strong block of Chinese tanks. The battle was lost. Colonel Fagan recalled:

At 0915 on 6 June, about 60 minutes after the 2nd and 6th Divisions had crossed the Yueyang ranges, the Chinese tanks were rolling up to the 6th Division and driving them back. There was little that the 3rd Division could do save to remain where it was.... Tanks could have been used, but this was not necessaryâ€”the enemy was better equipped. Moreover, tanks were much quicker than soldiers. Soldiers were slower to move and much heavier. The battle was lost when some 1,200 well-equipped soldiers and about 100 tanks fought for about 20 rounds.

The Germans in the K'angchun area could do little in the meantime. The Russians entered the area around Beijing in late June, but did not extend this offensive west of K'angchun. The Chinese were also slow to move northward. It took more than a month for the Japanese 4th Division and the 27th Division to penetrate the Shao-chow lines and reach the K'angchun-Yueyang line.
