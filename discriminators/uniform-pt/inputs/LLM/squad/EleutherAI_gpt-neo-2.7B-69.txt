 he could impose his will on everyone with a whim. The more powerful or influential, the more influence he could wield on the individual.

These ecclesiastical "priests", also called by the Italians the "ordini di segnore", "ordini de segnore", "cavalletti di segnore" or "fabbricatori di segnore", were the true feudal lords of the Middle Ages, like the dukes of Normandy, lords of the French church, or lords of fiefs from the lands controlled by bishops in Italy. Most of the clerical elites belonged to the so-called Orders of Friars Minor or the Minor Canons. There were several other orders, the Dominicans, Franciscans and Carmelites, each of which had their own peculiarities.

In France, a large portion of the ecclesiastical leadership were the so-called "éminence grise", "éminence grise dans le palais", "éminences grises" ("councillors in the palace", "grand seigneur") and "grand éminences". The term "éminence grise" is derived from the Latin expression "in signo di grise" ("in the sign of the glove"), which is a euphemism meaning "grace-faced" or "the sign of the glove". The term "grand seigneur" is a synonym for "grand inquisitor" in Medieval Latin, which literally meant "head shaper", but the modern version is "grand inquisitor supreme". In German, these leaders are called "Griffine" and the Latin word "Grifine" is the diminutive form of the term. They were the ultimate feudal lords in that they had the ultimate power over the entire land and everything within it. A griffine might even pass his powers down to his subordinates. The Italian grifines, which originally translated into Latin as inquisitori, were originally just regular inquisitors. Like the feudal lords, the griffines held "tithes" on the church, the people, and their lands.
