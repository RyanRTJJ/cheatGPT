 by the Japanese anime producers on the opening theme, which includes the lyrics, "Anime is a way we can enjoy anime." Digimon Adventure tri. will air every Monday evening beginning on December 13th (on Tokyo MX, TBS, BS11, TV Aichi, MBS2) and will be available on Netflix. It will start streaming on December 27th.

Watch the promo clip for the sixth episode below:

The series will be based on the Digimon Adventure tri. manga which began in Digimon Adventure 02 and published by Archie Comics (which still owns the rights). The series follows the events seen in the manga and also introduces a new anime series starring Naota Tsurumi (the voice of Ushiro Takeda in Digimon Adventure 01). The series takes place in a new, post-9/11 world where cyber attacks destroyed the world, with mankind and humans separated into a world where they live in different nations, the world where all three Digimon are humans, the world in which people in Digimon World have a new, separate personality for good and evil, and the world where the power of the Eine Ziehen has taken over the world's resources after the time-traveling Erika is abducted by mysterious alien forces.

A new anime series titled Digimon World: Next Order premiered in Japan last April, with it being dubbed in English by Studio Deen and subtitled in Japanese by TV Tokyo. As its synopsis also reveals, the title refers to a new universe where there are more than 120 species, and the new television series will tie into that universe and take the Digimon characters into new realms for the first time ever.
