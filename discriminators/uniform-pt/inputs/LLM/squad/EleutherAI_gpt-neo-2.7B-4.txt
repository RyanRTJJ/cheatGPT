. After four games in which they win one game and lose one, a team will take a week off and only play two teams from their own division before returning for their Super Bowl campaign. It’s a pretty even playing field.

With all that being said, Super Bowl XLV should be a rather different Super Bowl. Even though the defending champion Philadelphia Eagles finished with the fifth seed in their conference, their Super Bowl competition will likely be played on a team who has never won the Super Bowl in 14 tries. The NFC East champion Dallas Cowboys may not match the Super Bowl record of four wins, but the Cowboys boast two Super Bowl MVPs in the last 30 years in Emmitt Smith and Emmitt Smith II. So a team with a Super Bowl-record 12–4 record won’t have a chance against a team with a Super Bowl-record 12-loss record, even though the Cowboys defeated their divisional division rival, the second place Washington Redskins.

In years, we may begin to notice a few Super Bowl teams in the first round of the draft. This year, however, may be the best Super Bowl of the future. Here are ten players under twenty years of age that could be in position to win Super Bowl XLV at the end of it. We look at how to evaluate their chances, and if they are actually good enough to win the Super Bowl now.
