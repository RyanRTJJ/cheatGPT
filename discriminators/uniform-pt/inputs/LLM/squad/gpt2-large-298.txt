acks into another human hand for 10 or 15 seconds. In a sense the water drops do not cause the person dropping the water to feel pain until it is touched.

The concept of natural choice can be used to understand the phenomena of asymmetry of causation and natural randomness. In natural selection, symmetric outcomes are expected since life is an opportunity for survival and no amount of luck or chance can make a truly random outcome.

The asymmetry of causation for human hands can be explained in terms of asymmetry of incentives:

Natural selection could see no reason for any person in the game to not choose to perform a strategy to maximize their chances of survival in the case of an opponent who chooses not to play at all. This is why the only reason for natural selection to make a person kill anyone under certain circumstances was that a person's success was a good example of the type of reward associated with this strategy. Since the survival advantage provided by a strategy is symmetric, it follows that every strategy to maximize survival should minimize the natural selection pressure associated with it. â€¦ Natural selection would therefore make no difference between two equally advantaged individuals carrying out the same strategy at their opponent's expense and a player deliberately giving the advantage to one of his players to make it more difficult for the other to compete.
