 the United States, the majority of respondents preferred to label nature-related words in terms of physical, mental or emotional appeal. For example, among Swedes, green was chosen to represent nature, while most Germans choose blue and green to represent happiness.

These results indicate that people perceive objects and environments as "green" depending on the culture they were born in. This is important not only because it illustrates that attitudes toward green are strongly connected to cultural heritage, but also because it reinforces the importance of incorporating the positive aspects of green into new cultural meanings and identities for a broader range of people. We thus expect that green will have a similar status in future generations as blue and green do today.

We suggest the following questions for future studies. What are a green society's green-oriented objectives and their environmental significance? How much green do we need in our everyday lives? What green-related concepts (e.g. green economy) might lead to a transformation in our culture and society? Can these concepts help reduce social barriers and environmental harm in future generations? And to make such concrete recommendations to governments of the future, how are green concepts associated with policy decisions and institutions of governments.
