Another early mechanical vacuum cleaner, the one that had been perfected at the beginning of the century, was the one called the "Swan T" vacuum pump.


It would be the Swan T which had more than a cult following.

They were cheap and effective and, if properly maintained, they lasted for many years.

They are still produced today but can often be spotted in a high market for antique or vintage toys.


But, in 1878 it was the Swan T that seemed to rule the vacuum-packed air vacuum.

In March 1879 Charles Stearn published his breakthrough vacuum-filling treatment for vacuum pumps called the "Filling" theory.

According to his hypothesis, the solution to the blackening problem lay in filling the tubes of a vacuum pump with alcohol, which made them expand and release, through their air channels, the gas that could clean the air.

While the theory looked plausible, little was done based on it until the late 1890's, when Edward Wood, a professor at Oxford bought a Swan vacuum pump which he used for 30 years.

Wood was a self-taught engineer and so, unlike the experts in the academic world of the day, he applied his knowledge to vacuum pumps directly.


In 1900, the world began to take a serious interest in vacuum pumps and Swan vacuum was a name that was quickly attached to some of the world's best vacuum pumps such as the Stearn and Hartley vacuum motors.

At one time, these devices were the best in the world, powered by coal to generate much more power than the gas from wood, that was being used by Stearn and Hartley.

Swan vacuum were also the first to successfully create an air tube, which was vital when the electrical vacuum cleaners of today were
