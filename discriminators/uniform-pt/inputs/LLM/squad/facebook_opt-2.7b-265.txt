, with records dated from the Neolithic period (up to about 3,500 BC) through to the time of the Romans. The Romans used copper in coins as early as the 1st century BC. In the medieval period, copper was primarily used in the silver and bronze ages of European history, as both precious metals and tools. The first known coinage using copper was from Rome. The Romans began using iron and steel after copper became inedible, meaning it was no longer a desirable product for the masses. Because of its durability and malleable nature for forging objects, copper was used in a variety of instruments that were highly desired for the craftsmen. The early development of the modern metallurgist was due to the use of copper and its ability to be an alloyed element. By the 18th century, copper was primarily used as a valuable metal in tools and the foundry industry. It was also used to manufacture glass.

During the early 20th century, copper came into the forefront of industrial technology. As copper evolved to the point whereby its value as an alloy was realized, copper was used for a wide variety of technical activities. There were concerns about copper’s toxicity. During the 1930’s, the copper content was decreased to lower levels to assure the toxicity levels. But in 1946, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the use of a higher copper content to ensure protection from the toxin.

In addition to the metal, copper also includes a wide variety of chemicals that are derived from it. The copper compounds used in metalworking contain a copper metal matrix along with additional elements. These chemicals are
