 Since 2009, Morgan Stanley has been buying land directly south of its existing Atlantic City hotel to build casinos and other luxury hotels. The company has also used land as collateral for some of its mortgage lending.

In 2012, Morgan Stanley acquired 20 acres of land directly out of the area surrounding the Casino Resort Hotel from the Atlantic City-based developer of Ritz-Carlton (formerly Ritz-Carlton's gambling resort).

Morgan Stanley has been buying land from Atlantic City government officials, including Governor David Paterson, because of their opposition to the proposed Atlantic City casino as well as other "re-development," like its redevelopment of the abandoned South Street Bridge, which will create multiple hotel projects around it.

Morgan Stanley also has purchased land directly north of the Atlantic City Convention Center for $2.6 billion, and has also bought land directly toward the site of the proposed Atlantic City airport, the proposed expansion of the Port Newark Navy Yard, and a proposed state-approved project to convert two of its Atlantic City properties west of the Delaware River into luxury hotel projects.
