But there was a third element: what if the theory had changed and the Earth was in the process of changing? Wallace wrote: "Here is my answer to this question, and to every one of them, at this moment, I do indeed make no such claims, and that I am not sure at what moment I should make all these claims about human nature.

A month later, Darwin wrote: "One thing which is remarkable is that
