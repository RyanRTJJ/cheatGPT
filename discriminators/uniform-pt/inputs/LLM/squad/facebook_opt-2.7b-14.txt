 anonymous paper titled ‘Papers on the Rights of Man’ first used the term ‘liberties and equality’ alongside an image of ‘a king who is surrounded by the rights of his subjects, not as a tyrant, for in power, he must keep the fear of his subjects, but as a ruler, who holds the liberty of his subjects and does not desire his subjects should be afraid of him’.

If we apply the term ‘liberty’ not simply to the right of the people, but to the protection of that right – whether it is physical, social or political, – then in the context of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, the British revolution, as well as the American and French revolutions – had a clear, unambiguous, historical basis.

Therefore, despite the term ‘liberation’ being used to describe the French and American revolutions, today’s American and British versions of the word do not have a strong historical or ideological association with them.

For instance, in the case of the French Revolution, one could argue that instead we need to
