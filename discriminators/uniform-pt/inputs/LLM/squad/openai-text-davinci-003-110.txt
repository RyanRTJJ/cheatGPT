s happened when a childless Queen Elizabeth of England died without leaving a royal heir, leaving the Scottish King, James, to claim the throne. 

James then became James I of England and Ireland, unifying the two countries under the same monarch. He was succeeded by his son Charles I in 1625, and his successors, Charles II and James II, also assumed the crowns of both countries. James II was overthrown in 1689 in what became known as the "Glorious Revolution," with his daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange becoming joint sovereigns of England and Scotland. 

The two realms were formally united by the Act of Union of 1707, which combined the two parliaments into one, the Parliament of Great Britain. This new entity included both the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, and would eventually grow to include Wales, with the passage of the Acts of Union 1800. This union is today referred to as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
