 statements about mental states or individual experiences. Despite its prominence in the ensuing decades, phenomenalism had become increasingly untenable due to the fact that it could not adequately explain the world in scientific terms. In particular, the idea that only individual experiences are real seemed untenable in light of the overwhelming prevalence of intersubjective phenomena and general laws of nature. Contrary to the view held by phenomenalists, the scientific understanding of nature was determined by forces and structures operating on a level far beyond the bounds of an individual's experiences. Additionally, the frequent observation of physical structures which could only be viewed as the product of synthesis contradicted the atomism that had been held by many phenomenalist philosophers.

As a result, postwar empirical philosophy underwent a dramatic shift from a predominantly phenomenalist orientation to a more holistic outlook which emphasized the organization of experience and the importance of natural science. Researchers sought to explain the world using sets of general laws and principles formulated by scientists, while paying particular attention to the way in which individual experiences interacted with the larger environment. As philosopher Thomas Kuhn put it, “The essential tension between the phenomenalist theories of the past and the contemporary holistic approach is that whereas the former looked for the explanations of things primarily in the elements of experience, the latter looks to the structure of the whole to explain individual phenomena,” (Kuhn, 1962, p. 95). This shift has enabled a greater
