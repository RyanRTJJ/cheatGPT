de variety of dietsâ€”from strictly herbivorous, to omnivorous, to carnivorous, to scavenging. Some species even use their teeth to manipulate food items in order to more fully extract nutrients from plants. Insectivorous mammals consume more insects than any other mammals. Seed predators such as beavers use their incisors to crack open the tough outer shells of nuts and seeds, while others, like voles, use their incisors to nibble off the soft portions of grasses. Carnivorous mammals consume other warm-blooded animals, usually making quick kills with sharp canine teeth; or, like skunks and the crab-eating raccoon, they may scavenge animal carcasses. Omnivorous mammals such as humans consume both plant and animal material. 

In order to meet their energy needs, most mammals consume plant material in order to obtain carbohydrates and fats. Additionally, animals also consume proteins in order to build new proteins and repair damaged proteins found in their cells. These proteins come from animals eaten, primarily from the muscles and organs. Since plants do not possess the same muscle and organ proteins found in animals, many mammals have evolved different ways to extract the proteins from plants. For example, some mammals have evolved the ability to convert indigestible plant cell wall components, such as cellulose and hemicellulose, into forms that can be digested more easily, like monosaccharides, which can then be used for energy. Additionally, some mammals, such as horses and cows, have evolved the ability to ferment and digest plant material in their rumen (or stomach) in order to obtain energy and proteins.
