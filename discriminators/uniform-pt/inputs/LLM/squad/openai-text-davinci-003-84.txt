nzaga Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, ended the Mexican-American War of 1846â€“1848.

The treaty granted the United States nearly 525,000 square miles of Mexican territory, including all of present-day California, Nevada, Utah, and parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming. The treaty also required Mexico to cede all claims to Texas, which had declared its independence from Mexico in 1836. The treaty gave American settlers the right to purchase land in Mexican terms and guaranteed Mexican citizens, who found themselves within the borders of the new American territories, their property rights and citizenship. The United States agreed to pay Mexico $15 million dollars in exchange for the ceded land. The treaty also created the International Boundary Commission to survey and mark the newly established border.
