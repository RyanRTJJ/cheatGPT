The Treaty of Versailles was a peace treaty signed at the end of World War I in 1919. It established the post-war world and the specific conditions of peace between the Allied Powers, Germany, and other countries involved in the conflict. Specifically, Article 119 of the Treaty stated that the city of Metz, along with the surrounding region of Lorraine, would be returned to France in accordance with the terms of US President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points. The Fourteen Points outlined Wilson’s vision for a peaceful post-war world, including the right of all nations to self-determination and the recognition of national boundaries. This echoed the people of Metz who had been demanding the return of the city to France for some time prior to the signing of the Treaty.
