ism seeks social recognition and approval, usually to the detriment of other people's concerns. Adolescents focus on themselves and the attention behind it, often forgetting the needs of their peers.

Some egocentric behaviors can be exhibited in different ways such as ignoring the opinion of others, selfishness, manipulating or coercing others into doing what they want, and being overly competitive. Present in all minds, these behaviors are particularly exaggerated in adolescents, as they experience changes in behavioral and emotional patterns. Because of this, they naturally become more absorbed in themselves and their interests. Furthermore, adolescents may become more influenced by peers and seek validation within the social hierarchy, which can cause them to act in selfish and egocentric ways.

To prevent egocentrism from developing in adolescents, it is important to help them understand empathy and maintain a connection to how other people may feel in certain situations. Social emotional learning, teaching adolescents healthy coping strategies, and promoting open communication are all important ways to decrease the tendencies of egocentrism in adolescents. Educators, families, and peers can play an important role in promoting healthy social values and behavior in adolescents, to ensure that all peers can collaborate and engage with one another in a healthy and productive environment.
