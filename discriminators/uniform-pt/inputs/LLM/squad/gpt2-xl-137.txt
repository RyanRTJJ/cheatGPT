 Top debuted with You Better Run (1973), which reached their peak in 1978 recording My Way to Heaven (1978). In 1980 the seminal thrash metal band Metallica released Kill 'Em All (1980). In 1985, the first "alternative metal" band, At the Drive-In, released the album, Lace curtains (1985). Although metal remained a major part of the American rock and roll landscape for years, the genre was defined by an almost opposite trend. At the same time that heavy metal was becoming popular, classic rock and soft rock were in decline. The genre of hard rock was beginning to show that it could successfully compete with the new rock style. In the late 1980s, many metal bands began to experiment with more electronic sounds. One of these was Opeth, who in 2002 released the album Dream Theater, which featured a number of synthesizers. In 2003, in an attempt to gain success through a new style of music, Slayer released their album Reign in Blood (2003), also featuring a synthesizer. The "hard" style of metal, in which the music used large synthesizers was not only gaining in popularity; it also received a mainstream acceptance. With more and more rock bands beginning to use synthesizers, hard rock became more mainstream and, in the early 2000s, an alternative rock band known as Ozzy Osbourne and his band Black Sabbath became a huge worldwide success. However, in the last few years, hard rock and heavy metal has been more and more accepted. Today, metal has become more mainstream and the genre is even becoming considered "real" rock-n-roll.


In the summer of 2010, on the occasion of the 15th Anniversary of Metallica's Appetite (2005), Slayer began recording the next full length studio album. For the next few years Slayer has been hard at work recording the album, and now it has been revealed that the band will be releasing the album the summer of 2013.


On May 7, 2008, metal and hard rock legends Black Sabbath released their 10th studio
