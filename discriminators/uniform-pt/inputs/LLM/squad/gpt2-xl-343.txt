 the role of a good father to his son, but his actions and beliefs begin to become the cause instead of the solution. In The Life and Times of Errol Flynn, the main character's father is absent from his life until the end. This time, it is an evil doctor (and later a father figure) who manipulates that father.

The father in The Last Dragon is not the main character in that film, but the main character in The Last Dragon was the same person shown, but with another name and a new demeanor. Similarly, the father in All My Children is absent (though shown) in The Road to El Dorado. In each of these cases, the father is the problem. At least the presence of the father is implied.

In the last four films of The Road to El Dorado (included here by their original release date), the father is absent from the story. That is, in each film, the main character is out traveling away from home or exploring the wilderness. In this new film, we must assume he is absent. However, even if the father is present in the final film, he might not be as good a father as in the beginning. This is the case with La Cava. In this case, the father is still present in a minor role, but one with a new attitude. La Cava himself does not seem to care about his son's carelessness and foolishness, and La Cava's mother seems somewhat distant from them (and perhaps more concerned about other things).

Also note that the last three films of El Dorado have the main character coming in from the wilderness, with no clear sign of a father figure.

With El Dorado and The Last Dragon (1991 and 1999, respectively), the film is set in New Mexico. The protagonist of those films falls in love with a young girl named Isabelle (Christine Love), as opposed to the father of all women in The Last Dragon (Tom Selleck's role).

In The Last Dragon, the father is mentioned with an "illegitimate son" in the opening scene, but does not appear
