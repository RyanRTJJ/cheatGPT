On Wednesday, the team announced that the five women's basketball players were suspended indefinitely because of their involvement with the scandal. The program is currently suspended after ESPN first reported that the girls were involved in a photo that included former players.

In a statement sent to the school, athletic director Debbie Yow said that the NCAA has launched an investigation "in light of allegations that led to the arrests of four women."

She added: "A review of the facts and circumstances surrounding these arrests and suspensions will determine the appropriate course of action to be taken in conjunction with a comprehensive investigation."

The school said it could not speculate on when the players would be ready to rejoin the team, which is scheduled to play next weekend against Iowa State.

Yow did not respond Thursday to questions about the players' future.

In a Friday statement, the school said, in part:

"The University of North Carolina has suspended all six women's basketball players for the entire upcoming season. This action was taken based on the results of the NCAA's investigation. At no particular time do the University of North Carolina, basketball programs, or individuals cooperate with government investigative proceedings. We do, however, provide assistance to anyone who comes to us for help.
