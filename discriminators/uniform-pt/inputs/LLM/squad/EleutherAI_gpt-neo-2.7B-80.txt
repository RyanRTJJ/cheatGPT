 more facilities than needed. The first class of residence halls was designed to house men but were changed to accommodate women students in 1930. By 1944, the university had 12 residence hall buildings. The number of residence halls has slowly increased each year, as new buildings have been completed, with more being added in the years since.

The university's other facilities have not grown as much at this rate as its residence halls as a result of limited resources, including money and student loans. In addition, housing the university's research and clinical departments requires additional space. Thus, the university currently uses 12 buildings for both classroom and residential purposes. The largest residence hall of the university is the Hall of Humanities, which houses over 1,300 students. Other major buildings are the Alumni Center, which contains a 1,600-seat auditorium; and the Bauhart Complex, located approximately one mile from campus in Eastman Community College. For housing purposes, the campus is divided into three "regions": Old, Middle and New.

The Old Region consists of the original buildings that became residence halls. The most notable building in this area is the Old House. The building was originally a house for use as a student union, the residence of many faculty members of the university. In the 1920s and 1930s, this building was remodeled and expanded to serve as its current purpose of housing undergraduate students. The building features a clock tower, a roof terrace on the second floor, an open interior courtyard, several classrooms,
