e late sixth century to the Restoration of Constantinople’s Communication with Rome in 1368. Furthermore, it is clearly attested in several Byzantine liturgical texts of the eighth and ninth centuries, including a version of the Akathistos Hymn which, in its fourth and fifth verses, appears to make Mary’s Immaculate Conception the object of popular veneration.

The Byzantine Church held that Mary was free from all original and actual sin through her divine Maternity, since her humanity was assumed by the Divine Logos, who sanctified her and blessed her before her birth. This view, which implies preexistence, is related with the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, which holds that Mary was created in a state of grace and remained sinless throughout her life. The Eastern fathers also believed that, in a sense, Mary was “redeemed” in advance by her Son, who assumed her humanity before it was corrupted by sin. This same concept is found in the Protevangelium of James and in other early apocryphal works. In addition, Eastern theologians, such as St. Hilary of Poitiers, discussed a unique role for Mary in the Incarnation, implying that the pure, sinless humanity of Our Lady was necessary for her to be capable of providing a fitting receptacle for Jesus.
