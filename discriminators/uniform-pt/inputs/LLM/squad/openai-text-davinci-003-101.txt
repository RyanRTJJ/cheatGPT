Constantius had several motivations for ordering Liberius into banishment. He was enraged by the pope's refusal to accept the Arian doctrine and sign a new creed which supported it. He was also trying to enforce religious uniformity throughout the empire. He had a personal dislike of Liberius since he had openly spoken out against Constantiusâ€™ policy of appointing Arian bishops which included replacing Liberius with the Anti-Pope Felix in the archdiocese of Rome. 

This exile had immense consequences for the Roman Catholic Church. While in exile, Liberius wrote several letters to other bishop in an attempt to resist the Arian heresy - some of these letters have been preserved and have become important documents in the history of the Church.

Additionally, Liberius' banishment led to a schism in the Church, with the superior numbers of Arian believers in the region of Rome supporting Anti-Pope Felix and recognizing him as the official pope rather than Liberius. This split was not completely healed until the arrival of Pope Damasus I in 366, who resolved the dispute and reestablished Liberius' authority.
