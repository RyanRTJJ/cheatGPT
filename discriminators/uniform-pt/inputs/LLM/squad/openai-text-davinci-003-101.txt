has a much different species diversity than North America despite similarities in the climate and environment. The chapter discusses several theories that seek to explain the differences in species distributions in different geographic regions, including the idea of land bridges, dispersal by wind, and the concept of vicariance, or a change in a species' environment or range that divides a population and leads to the formation of distinct species. The chapter also covers island biogeography, which looks at how the size, age, and distance of islands affect the species found there. Finally, the chapter looks at the importance of biological collections and how the study of the Earth's history through fossils and other data provides insight into changes in the Earth's climate, geography, and species distributions over time. 

In conclusion, Chapter XI of Introduction to Evolutionary Biology deals with biogeography and the clues it provides to the history of evolution. It looks at the causes of differences in species distributions across regions, islands and continents, as well as the importance of fossil records in tracking the process of evolution. It provides an overview of the theories and evidence currently being used in evolutionary biology, and serves to emphasize the importance of understanding biogeographic data to get a complete picture of the evolutionary process.
