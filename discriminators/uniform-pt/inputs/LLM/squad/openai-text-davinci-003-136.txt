Hidalgo is seen as the Father of the Nation because he is credited with leading the revolt that began in 1810 against Spanish colonial rule. Although Iturbide was the one who formally declared Mexico's independence from Spanish rule, Hidalgo is seen as the precursor and most likely played a significant role in motivating Iturbide to act. Moreover, Hidalgo and his cry for a unified Mexican nation resonates among Mexicans to this day.
