irao I assumed the title of Peshwa, establishing a dynastic rule over the empire that lasted until the abolition of the Peshwa system in 1818.

The period of the Peshwas saw rapid expansion of the Maratha Empire. They brought much of the Deccan regions under their control, as well as large sections of present-day India, and made important conquests in the North, including Delhi, Oudh, and Rajputana. The Marathas also made major advances into the Carnatic and Mysore regions. During this period, the Maratha Empire built great monuments, such as the Shaniwar Wada in Pune and the Sea Forts at Suvarnadurg and Sindhudurg.

Following the death of Baji Rao I in 1740, his successor Balaji Baji Rao also became known as Nana Saheb. He further increased the Maratha power and influence and allied with the French in order to thwart the British advances. The Marathas also saw success against the Mughal Empire and the Durrani Empire (Afghans).

After suffering a devastating defeat at the hands of the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha War in 1818, the Peshwa system was abolished and the Maratha Empire was dissolved. The Marathas were then reduced to the status of a princely state in the British Raj, under the rule of the Gaikwad of Baroda.
