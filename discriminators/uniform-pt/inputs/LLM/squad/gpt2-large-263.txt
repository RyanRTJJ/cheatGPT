 cases out of a thousand were life-threatening injuries associated with the cable system, a rate of roughly 0.13 injuries per 10,000 trips. Cable cars are also much safer than public transportation: In the United States, only about nine per 10,000 people are killed or seriously injured on a bus or train on any given day. In contrast, just one person dies and one person injures another in a car every eight days on the Interstate system, despite the fact that the average speed is 70 mph.

But cable cars have their critics. They argue, in some cases, that the cable cars are a distraction from the street's busy, noisy streets, and that they detract from the pedestrian experience.

Why?

A few key factors:

• Cable cars require no registration and do not have to be inspected. No one has to stop when they see a cable car. They are not subject to traffic laws.

• Cable cars are less expensive to run compared to high-capacity street transportation. In fact, the cost of a year's maintenance on a cable car is less than 2.5% of a car's overall cost.

• According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of June 2013, there were only five deaths for every 500,000 people who ride the cable car system.

• Cable cars are not as noisy as in streets. But if you take into account that the "pops" occur at all locations, the noise will be greater. According to research by the American Public Transportation Association, when people are driving, they are about 3.5 times more likely to make a "hard" sound — like a car engine — than when they are on a bicycle taking a break. People are also 20% more likely to make a "soft" sound, like a whistle or a hand-whistle, when riding on the road.

• Car and cable car riders are more likely to sit close together than people taking other forms of public transportation. That is because people who live where there are few pedestrian crossings have more room to comfortably sit together.

• Cable cars create a sense of public space. Their presence creates more space for the pedestrian, especially in crowded downtown areas.

• Cable cars prevent people from
