 soon turned towards the American market as its growing economy and colonies needed support in the form of foreign investment. In the mid-1700s, the Royal African Company sought to set up operations in the American colonies. The new company was to trade with the native populace and sell tea or coffee from its colony ships on the coastal towns.

The Company was granted royal support, but its first major undertaking came in February 1704 when it sent a fleet under the command of Admiral George Anson of Anson's Rangers under Admiral Sir Thomas Graves.

The Royal African Company was formally established by royal charter on 16 October 1696, when the Act of Association granted it Â£50,000. When the Royal African Company was first formed in 1696, the Royal African Company's primary purpose was to buy slaves to supply Britain's navy. The ship, _Nympheus_, was purchased in 1710. After the Royal African Company failed in 1711 to obtain loans from French bankers, the company had to establish its own financial empire, the East India Company, with government support.

The Company's activities expanded well beyond the acquisition of slaves, with it purchasing the slave ships _Amazone, Calcutta_ and _Nympheus_ and several fishing vessels from the Royal Navy. With the exception of the Calcutta, all new fleet ships were constructed in the East India Company's dockyards in Bombay by 1707, which were also used by the British navy for their own warship operations.
