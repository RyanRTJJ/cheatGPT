As per the monsoon report issued by India Meteorological Department, the onset of the southwest monsoon in the country will be marked by the beginning of cloudy weather conditions along the coast, north and south Kerala and Bay of Bengal areas. During the next one week, strong winds from the south will bring widespread rainfall over Assam, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and parts of Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Punjab, West Bengal, Sikkim, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat from June 18, 2018. This rain will gradually progress towards central, east, and northeast India with the arrival of the southwest monsoon into eastern Odisha on June 21, 2018, and into western Kerala on June 24, 2018. The monsoon arrives over the country as the monsoon trough runs across south-eastern Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh and north-western Bihar and in contact with the cyclonic circulations over central India.
