 pathogenesis of such diseases. For other cases, identification is helpful but for the purpose of research or other medical purposes, usually there is no objective criterion requiring a determination. Further, a single organism in several different cultures does not represent the normal flora or fauna of a population, but instead shows a variation as a consequence of disease or other environmental factors. Therefore, identification of the source of a disease is important only where such a disease is caused by a certain species of a single genus. Accordingly, classification is the most useful method for determining the source of any disease.
Classification of infectious agents into genera is made based on morphological or biochemical features, chemical or biological characteristics, or specific genetic differences. Molecular typing of infectious agents can also be used, but in order that it be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of disease, it is necessary that it allow the production of markers of the particular pathogen that is being identified. This is a labor-intensive and expensive process, and therefore is not preferred for diagnostics or treatment.
For pathogenesis of diseases, isolation and classification are accomplished either by clinical or genetic analysis. In clinical epidemiology, genetic analysis is preferred, whereas in genetic epidemiology, isolation is preferred. Genomic sequencing can be utilized to characterize the entire genome of organisms, whereas molecular sequencing can only be used to identify the genes responsible for specific effects. The cost of genomic sequencing is prohibitively expensive at the present time,
