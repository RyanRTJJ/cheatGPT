reck." Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club viewed that "While the combination of vocal talent and daffy hijinks make each episode of American Idol legitimately fascinating, the real test of the series' artistic worth is if its recordings will endure beyond its TV run."

The show's most acclaimed album was "Kelly Clarkson." Following its release, Christine E. Gilyard of PopMatters wrote: "Sheâ€™s an authoritative pop/rock/R&B diva in the making and a natural Grammy contender. Her album is well-crafted, witty and seductive, honing a sassy and tender personality strongly equipped to survive the hurdles of the music industry. She's not just a precocious young talent with a wide-open voice but also an energetic singer ready to slug it out with the best of them."
