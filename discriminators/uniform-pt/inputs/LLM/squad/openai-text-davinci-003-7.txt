g, length and various other properties of mammalian hair can also vary quite drastically. Coloration of mammalian hair can range from white, black, brown and even red, yellow and a variety of other colors. The thickness of hair can also vary greatly as well, with some taxa possessing thicker or thinner fur.

Variation of coloration and texture of mammalian hair can be attributed to a variety of factors. These factors can range from environment, adaptation to predation pressure, development, and genetic mutation. The environment in which the organism resides can influence hair color and texture due to the amount and type of sunlight received, humidity levels, and other environmental conditions. These conditions are usually not constant and can shift over time, resulting in shifts in the coloration and texture of the mammalian hair.

Adaptation to predation pressure is another factor that can influence the hair color and texture of mammals. This can involve animals such as predators and prey, which have evolved to better suit their environments and increase their chances of survival by altering their hair color, texture and thickness. For example, prey animals may develop thinner, lighter colored fur to better blend in with the environment, while predators may have thick, dark fur that makes them harder to spot.

Genetic mutations can also cause radical shifts in the color and texture of mammalian hair. Mutations in certain genes related to the production and deposition of pigmentation, such as melanin and carotenoids, can result in unique and unique hair colors. For example, albinism, which results from a mutation in the MCRS gene, can lead to a lack of pigment in the hair and a much lighter color compared to the normal coloration.

Overall, mammalian hair varies between
