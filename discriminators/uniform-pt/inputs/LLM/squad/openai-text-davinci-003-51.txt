stions related to their current emotional states. Schachter's experiments further illuminated the connection between emotions, hormones, and cognitions. He suggested that physiological arousal (from hormones such as epinephrine) could lead to either emotional activation or emotional labeling, depending on the individual's experience and interpretation. Schachter believed that emotion and cognition are intertwined, and that emotion can be label-based or arousal-based, depending on how individuals interpret the physiological changes they experience. He also proposed that emotions can be a result of cognitive processes, such as interpreting the context of a situation, that influence the individual's perception of the emotions they are feeling.
