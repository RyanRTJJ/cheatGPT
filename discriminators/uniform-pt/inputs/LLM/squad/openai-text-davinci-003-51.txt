ppella vocal ensembles were liturgical and were composed of two main parts, often separated into a cantus firmus that held the melody and counterpointed by a motet. This allowed for the development of complex polyphony and eventually four-part harmonies, which would go on to form the basis of the a cappella sound in later years. During this time, a cappella music was confined to the private chambers of the Church and was rarely performed in public. 

The development of Renaissance-era polyphonic sacred music flourished during the Baroque period in the 17th century, when a cappella ensembles began to perform outside of the Church. Famous composers such as Claudio Monteverdi, Antonio Vivaldi and Giovanni Battista Pergolesi wrote multiple a cappella compositions for festivals, concerts, and operas. As a result, a cappella music began to gain broader popularity, and the concept of several unified voices singing different melodies was embraced.

In more recent years, the popularity of a cappella has grown significantly, especially with the introduction of films such as Pitch Perfect (2012) and The Sing Off (2009-2014).
