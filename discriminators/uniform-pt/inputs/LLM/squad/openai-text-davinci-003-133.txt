and throughout the Napoleonic era, Napoleon sought to increase French control of the island. He used a combination of strategy, diplomacy, and force to achieve his goals. He established treaties with local leaders in the Caribbean, which allowed for increased trade between the French and their colonies. Napoleon also sought to bolster the French presence in Saint-Domingue, dispatching troops and governors to the island. He even offered economic incentives, such as subsidies and grants, in exchange for loyalty to the French government. In 1802, Napoleon succeeded in restoring French authority in the area and suppressing a rebellion in Saint-Domingue. This returned the island to France, although it was renamed Haiti in 1804 after a successful revolution led by the Haitians against French rule. 

Napoleon's efforts to reinstate French rule in Saint-Domingue had a long-lasting impact in both regions. In the Caribbean, France's tightened control created a new precedent of French dominance that would shape the region's politics for centuries to come. Napoleon's colonization efforts in Haiti, however, further legitimized the country's independence, which eventually led to its successful revolution. While France eventually ceded authority in Haiti, Napoleon's ambitions for French control in the Caribbean had a pervasive effect and played a major role in shaping the region's history.
