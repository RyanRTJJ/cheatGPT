 Hispanic. Although the Club's music is described as "house," it was popular among various other groups as well.

Hip-hop was first introduced into Chicago by rappers from the North Side of Chicagoâ€”and also in New York by groups such as the Beastie Boys, the Sugarhill Gang and the group Run-DMC. The Chicago natives in hip hop would release their albums at the Warehouse. Hip-hop's first huge hit came from a song entitled "Let's Do It," released on September 27, 1977, and recorded by the popular group Drexciya.

Chicago has also had a strong legacy of funk and jazz music, particularly among its African-American community. Many notable musicians from such groups have left their mark on the city's music scene.

This map does not show all the venues found within the Chicago borders. The Warehouse was not the first Chicago venue, and it did not host every event.
