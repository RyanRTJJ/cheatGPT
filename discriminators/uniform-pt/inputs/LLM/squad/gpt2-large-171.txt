and the Greek colony of Dacia) and brought Macedonian society to a grinding halt. Demetrius was defeated at the Battle of Teotia in which his men forced Lysimachus to hand over the throne to the Macedonian army and left Cilicia with the Greeks on the run.

However, the Greek colonists of the Dacians (now the Dacia region of Greece) did something remarkable. By having the Dacians become Greeks as well, they put the Macedonans on the defensive. The Dacians were the first to become Greek under Macedonian rule until much later. Before Demetrius led his Macedonians to victory at the Battle of the Hydra, the Dacians already had a permanent population of some 70,000. Before Demetrius marched to war against them, they were already part of the Greek community in the Dacian Diodotia. From this time forward, they were considered Greeks by every Macedonian in the Dacian Diodotia.

Another example is the conquest of Cyprus by Macedonian and Cilician invaders in the 4th Century CE. Many of the first Greeks were colonists of the northern Aegean islands, including the island of Cyprus.

Greek colonies of Africa

Another example is the settlement of Athens in the Greek colony of Syros in the 7th century BCE. Other colonies include Rhodes, Rhodesia in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Nyasaland, and Egypt.

Modern Greek colonization of Italy

To complete the picture we have a very interesting case of Greek colonization around the 5th century BCE. In 451 BC, the Greeks under the leader Philip II founded a Greek colony in Asia Minor.
