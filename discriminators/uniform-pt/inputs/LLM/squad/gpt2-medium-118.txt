 President, James Polk, decided to take steps to avoid war. He called for three hundred soldiers to accompany him. The first and last ones were sent from Newbern, Mass. It was during his presidency that Union Army General George Washington led the charge in the War of 1812, eventually taking over much of the North where he found himself. Washington eventually surrendered during the summer of 1813, but the U.S. Army had been defeated two years earlier and, once again, was forced to retreat. As a peace reprieve, New York was divided into five districts of five states. The Army remained within the New York City area, holding out until the day before a major mobilization that would culminate in a victory at Yorktown. Many of Washington's men had been veterans of World War I, the British Empire's invasion of Europe. The army had been fighting for nearly five months. When Washington finally surrendered, he left behind a legacy of generals that still makes the United States the only country to be defeated completely in a war not fought in World War I.
