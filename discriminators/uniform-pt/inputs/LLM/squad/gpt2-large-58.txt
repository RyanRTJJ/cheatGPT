Many adolescents experience some distress because they lack support networks and may engage in self-harm and substance abuse. And some adolescents report having difficulty in finding and maintaining romantic partners.

So what can support programs do to help these young people thrive?

Although this is an emerging field of research, many interventions to prevent suicide continue to focus primarily on suicide prevention and its prevention in young people.

A recent review by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that only 5 percent of all adult-aged suicides in recent years were among young adults.3 In the same study, the Department of Veterans Affairs found that many teens are not seeking mental health services, even though youth represent the largest and most diverse demographic of persons with mental health problems.8 (See figures 1 and 2.)
