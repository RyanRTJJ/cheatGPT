encian Autonomous Government in southern Spain. A study estimated that half the population could not identify Spanish words, even when spoken in a foreign tongue.

The City of Zagreb has its own unique culture, and the locals are a friendly bunch, with many of the young and well-educated working as foreign workers in local companies and government organizations. The city boasts the first tram in Central Europe; the city center was the setting of a major Bosnian wartime protest action in 1992. Also interesting about the city is that Croatia was only a state while Zagreb was a city.

Zagreb is also home of Stade de Luka, and although some games played there don't take place at the stadium, they are played in Zagreb in an effort to further local culture.

Riviera Calabria, Italy

Riviera Calabria is one of the least known states in Italy, but it is probably one of the hottest. The state lies in the Calabrian foothills just over the border from Austria and Italy. It is more Mediterranean in its geography than either Burgundy, the French Riviera, or the TuscANY, but it has a much smaller population than the other two. It is known for being extremely wealthy, as well as as being somewhat neglected compared to those regions in those parts of Italy. One of the main areas of investment of the state is tourism, which is a major driver of economic activity in the region. Many of its historic palaces are well-known throughout the world, and it is the main center for art and museums in the entirety of Italy (the other cities have their own art, but Riviera Calabria has become a cultural center of its own).
