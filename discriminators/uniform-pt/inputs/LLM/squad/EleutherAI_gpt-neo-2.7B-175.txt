 and outcome of the disease. In general, the most sensitive and specific methods for identification rely on the isolation of the organism from blood, the development of a serum or enzyme-linked immune system (ELISA) antibody in a specific host animal (e.g., horse) or the development of characteristic structural proteins in the organism. These methods are limited to a particular group of agents that were initially considered to be distinct by one or more of the methods described above (i.e., bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites), but where, after further study, the agents have been shown to be indistinguishable.
Many infectious agents produce proteins to function as antigens which can then be detected by ELISA, radioimmunoassay or any other means. As a result, the antigenic specificity of these pathogenic organisms is often called in question. When these organisms are shown to be non-identical by these specific antibody tests or lack characteristic structural proteins, the prior designation of such as antigen may be given up and replaced by classification as “definitely no antigen” or “a potentially antigenic protein”. Many such agents or their components are not even named; these would be classified as “not antigenic” if their ability to produce an immunogenic antigen was already known.
The inability to detect the presence of an organism at the time of disease, may occur when the organism, although pathogenic under normal conditions, never enters the body when the immune response is directed against it. During the course of an infection, the immune response
