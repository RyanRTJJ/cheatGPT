-hitter to lead off the second inning, allowing the Cubs' first homer of the year, and then had the Reds score in the fifth to advance to the NLCS, a move made by the club's president, Jim Callies, with the hope of putting a dent in the Reds' lead with some time on the calendar and a victory.

That's how Chicago managed to hold the lead in early October and get back on the win rolls in six less games of AL East play, with the New York Mets ending six straight shutout and Colorado leading for much of the rest of the season in 11th place, winning 13 of 18 games.

Not much of a shock, as the Cubs got off to a bad start in part due to pitcher Joe Blanton's double, but that didn't mean the organization could muster up so much as 15 wins in five weeks, with Blanton playing just three inning games in the third and fourth, and giving up six runs and 3 home runs in just six innings of work.

The Cubs were only able to maintain a 2-0 lead (6-8-1) when Blanton got by Chase Field in the sixth for the first time in his career, scoring his fifth double and scoring his sixth run of the game that sent the crowd into a frenzy.

With no outs in the middle of the ninth, Chicago hit three more bases, but as the second inning approached in the seventh, home plate umpire Bob Kinsley ruled the ball was too low for a runner to get to Field, leading to Blanton hitting two more bases in the same stretch, giving up two runs and seven hits throughout. Blanton walked just five and was placed on the 7-day disabled list with an oblique issue, but was back on the DL for three to four hours before being released on Saturday.
