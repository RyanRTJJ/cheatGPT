 broke free from the bonds they bound them within and went on to lead an uprising of the Chinese People against Cao Cao's tyranny.

Chao Xian-Chong and Shang Kexi and their allies and followers led a violent and bloody assault on Cao Cao's army in the autumn of 576. With the arrival of Gao Fei-Shu and his men (who escaped to a place they were hiding to escape the attack) from the mountains, Cao Cao was forced to retreat to Aizan to protect it from destruction. Though he was killed during the initial assault, Liu Bei's troops returned swiftly after Cao Cao's defeat, defeated by his army at the Battle of Nuanjing in 578. Cao Wei's soldiers continued to fight at Cao Cao's disposal at this point until 585 BC. As a result of his failure to defeat Cao Cao, Wu Sangui's group of revolutionaries split from Mao in 558. Wu, T'ai Shian and their men were eventually killed by them and retreated back to the mountains where they were able to form a faction of T'ai Shan's forces. In 563 BCE, the Shuan family led the Great Wall of China. In the time since then, the city's walls have continued to be constructed.

During the years following the collapse of Taiping (after which Wu Sangui became the emperor of the empire, with the authority of the Wu clan from his death in 603 BCE) and the formation of the Wu clan, this city has been rebuilt, its city walls rebuilt, its border fortified and numerous major religious shrines built along the walls to keep their worshippers out, most notably the Taiyi Temple complex at the entrance of the Great Wall.
