 its two campuses.

The college received national attention in July when campus president Richard Levin decided to rename Calhoun College in a sign of diversity. The announcement sparked uproar and backlash from some students — as well as supporters of the school — calling the move offensive, especially at a prominent public university.

In August — a month after Levin's initial announcement — the College Board revoked the designation.

When it was announced in July, the College Board's interim director of diversity and inclusion, Jennifer L. Kuch, defended the move by citing the "high visibility" of the campus — which has grown since 2000 — and the "vast majority" of alumni and students supporting the change. Levin, who began his College Board tenure that year, said he thought Calhoun College was an "affirmative action" plan for "white privilege."

Yet even after the name change, students, alumni and faculty at Calhoun College questioned whether the college should be renamed. "The College Board's action appears to be completely unsupported by the student population at Calhoun College," said an official letter sent to the board in August by a group of Calhoun students.

"In addition, the college now is under an intense focus of media attention and students say that they feel disrespected by the new name," the letter said in part.

The letter, signed by students and faculty, said the name, as it stands now, implies that "these faculty and students would not stand with the students of our campus and other black and brown students who continue to feel marginalized."

The University of Connecticut, for instance, has a number of racially segregated buildings that have no official designation. A statue of Samuel Brat in an African American history classroom is next door to the White House, where Obama received his undergraduate degree; other white memorials in the campus's buildings have black names.

Still, the University has never acknowledged that the College is racially segregated. In fact, in 2016, a University representative told The College Fix it had only been "inadvertently"
