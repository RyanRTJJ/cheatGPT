, and smell of food and is a very powerful stimulus. The chemical senses — taste and smell — are the first sensory modalities to receive signals from the gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system. The stomach has a strong innervation, and this stimulates the gastric phase of digestion, which begins in the stomach and is largely dependent on chemical signals. The gastric phase releases hydrochloric acid, pepsin, polypeptide hormones, and water into the duodenum where the pH drops to ˜2.6; this triggers the onset of the intestinal phase. The duodenum is the largest portion of the small intestine, containing 70 – 100 cm3 of fluid.
The stomach is the major organ that digests proteins, and it produces hydrochloric acid to help break down food. Chloride serves as a nutrient and is an essential component of gastric fluid. The rate of protein digestion in the stomach is dependent on the presence of gastric fluid as the enzyme pepsin requires a higher concentration of protein to be active.
Gastric digestion takes place in the stomach and begins when the food enters the duodenum. During gastric digestion, a stomach enzyme, pepsin (pH≈2.0) digests the protein, and hydrochloric acid breaks down the protein into small peptide fragments between 20 and 37 amino acids in length. The protein undergoes successive proteolytic digestion which leads to the development of an antinutrient factor, pepsin-antitrypsin complex. This complex causes liver damage and contributes to the morbidity of pulmonary diseases. After
