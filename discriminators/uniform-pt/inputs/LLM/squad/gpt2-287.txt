The most visible sign of this transition is a dramatic painting by Charles A Smith, commissioned under the direction of St. John the Evangelist. The figure is dressed as a Roman Roman soldier. The figure's silhouette, though the figure's features are identical, is not the same as the one on which the monastic iconographic figure was built, the figure of Christ or St. Dominic, as seen in the painting. Thus, the person's presence, posture and dress represent the same part of the Roman Roman life.

St. Dominic was the first bishop. He was originally crowned by a monk called the Holy Apostles, and he became the first of the Church's four bishops. St. Anthony was the successor of St. Matthew, the Roman bishop, and he died with his church on August 26, 2012.

As to a final interpretation of the "monastic iconography": there are three factors which contribute to the transition of public art in the Holy Church: The importance of the "spiritual and iconographic" element, the need for a monastic state or religious "culture", the need for Christian institutions and practices, and the need to develop new forms of worship and expression in the Church
