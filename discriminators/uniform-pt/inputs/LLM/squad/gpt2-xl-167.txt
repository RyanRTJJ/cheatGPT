. Its purpose was to determine the strength of the U.S. military and national economy and to determine the level of technical sophistication in the space program. (Military and economic programs include space launches and space research, and are in turn classified.)

The first launch in the competition was conducted in 1957 with the Soviet Union's first satellite, Sputnik, and the United States' first lunar satellite, Explorer 1. The second launch in May 1961 succeeded in putting an American satellite in orbit and proved that a satellite could be launched into orbit if its purpose was a purely scientific one (see: First Space Mission and Second Space Mission). Since then, the satellites have continuously been launched into space, reaching orbital altitudes ranging from about 500 to almost 15,000 miles (900-22,200 kilometers).

As the competition in space developed, the race between the two countries also extended into the technological development of missile technology. The U.S. Missile Technology Control Regime was launched after the Soviet Union's 1960 launch of Sputnik 2, which was followed by the American satellite Explorer 3.

For most of the 1960s and 1970s, American and Soviet research in high-energy rockets began to converge. For example, both countries had their own efforts in the development of liquid-fueled, single-stage launch vehicles, the Atlas I and Vanguard-class, respectively. Both also successfully flew the first two piloted Mercury missions to the moon, followed by one
