 capital at Delphi. However, Homer identifies them and Greek historians throughout Middle and Old Europe also named them as "Macedonian" after their capital city.

Greece

The Macedonian empire lasted from about 496 BC to 428 AD and was divided into three parts:

Sparta (modern Thrace)

Pisandria (modern Thessaly)

Zagros (modern Phrygia)

The first one (Sparta) is a region that stretched from central Anatolia across the northern borderland between Thessaly and Myssalate. The capital is at Sparta at the foot of Mount Parnassus. In reality, the Macedonians were divided into regions that also included many parts of Phrygia and parts of Thrace.

At this time the Greek and Macedonian cultures came into conflict because of differences in their religion and culture but the Macedonian Empire never completely fell. The final kingdom of Macedon made an immediate political move and began to build an alliance with the Achaemenids into which they formed a powerful alliance. The alliance also provided the Macedonian military forces with a powerful ally. Greece was divided into regions, the western half being called Macedonia. Greece had an important naval power along the southern coasts but its major source of revenue was the Mediterranean. The Persian Empire extended between the Black Sea and the Red Sea, with major cities in both countries. But Persian influence also extended southward, from Syria and the Levant to the Greek islands - such as Crete and the Adriatic. The Macedonian Greeks were not hostile to the Persian's influence in either area but there was friction and disagreements within the Macedonian army.

In 425 BC Macedon was forced to unite with the Achaemenid Dynasty
