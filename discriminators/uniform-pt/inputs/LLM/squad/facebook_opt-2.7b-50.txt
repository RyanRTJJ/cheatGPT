 egocentrism is relatively stable and appears to function reliably. The present studies examined the relationship between adolescents’ beliefs about their competence and their self-concept, measuring self-esteem, self-concept integrity and the adolescent’s self-esteem and self-concept core belief. The current data showed both internal and external validity as well as good discriminability. Self-esteem was negatively associated and self-concept integrity positively associated with self-esteem. Self-esteem increased with more positive core beliefs, whereas self-concept integrity was positively associated with lower self-esteem. The relationship between self-esteem and self-concept integrity was explained by core beliefs as a result of high self-confidence and negative self-concept integrity. While core beliefs and self-esteem interact, core beliefs do not appear sufficient to explain self-concept integrity. In addition to explaining core beliefs, self-concept integrity is an independent predictor of self-esteem. Finally, adolescents with core beliefs that were low in self-esteem but high in core beliefs were also more likely to have self-concept integrity. These findings contribute to current research into self-concept integrity and its use in psychometrics.

As social interaction is a fundamental component of our daily lives and adolescents’ social interactions play a central role in their interpersonal-cognitive development, it is important to understand their social interaction processes. Previous studies mainly focused on exploring the processes of social interaction in healthy adolescents, however, there are still some questions about the roles of social context in their social development. This is particularly important for adolescents who have a high conflict personality or who experience conflicts with their peers, since social development is generally characterized by such conflict and social conflict is widely recognized to be one of the most important factors affecting adolescents’ health and well-being. In this study, we explored the role of social background on adolescents’ social development by examining their relational competence (RP) and their perceived social competence (PSC) in four different situations. Relationships between RP and PSC were analysed using two-factor models and the relationships between self-esteem (SE) and PSC using a mixed-effects multilevel logit model. The results showed that RP and PSC were influenced by adolescents’ relationships
