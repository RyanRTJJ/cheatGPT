 a major obstacle to the restoration of relations between the two nations. The first Soviet government that recognized Germany's defeat in 1945 appointed Litvinov general secretary of the Supreme War Council, and on the eve of the second world war had no qualms about giving his brother a "final order of dismissal." German authorities promptly revoked Litvinov's citizenship in 1949, and German Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop, an ally of Hitler, ordered his arrest in 1947 for treason. Litvinov fled to Israel in 1947, and his two sons fled in the late 1950s.

Litvinov and his family, however, ultimately managed to flee to Germany in 1949 and 1949-50. The first son sought refuge with his father in France. His father died in 1956, however, and the second son returned to Germany to live with his father's granddaughter. In 1961, the brothers received the right to return to Israel, although the Jews left Germany prior to the reunification negotiations (to avoid political persecution).

After the reunification, Litvinov returned to Israel in 1984 after his son was allowed to return, and in 1988 a second son returned to Israel. His sister-in-law married a German citizen and in 1987-88 they fled to the Philippines, where they remained until their deaths in 2002.

Litvinov's death in 2002 was not expected to impede any further rapprochement between Germany and Israel, because Israel had a free hand with him. After he was given back his citizenship, Litvinov continued to live in Israel. In 2007, he was honored for his actions
