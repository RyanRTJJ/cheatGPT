Savers has received an anime adaptation in the form of television anime. Due to the lack of an official title and the fact that only seven episodes aired in the first season, the show received two pilot seasons which aired each Monday starting April 8 and November 15, 2005. The series aired on Fuji TV from 2008 to 2010. It is the third television anime series in the line to end, and the first to be released for the Sony Pictures Company.
