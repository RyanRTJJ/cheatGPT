yed in this statement has since been disproven. There is no universal recommendation for the amount of water intake for maintenance of good health. 

The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends that women should consume about 2.7 liters of total water per day and men 3.7 liters.This includes all sources of water, including food, beverages and other water sources such as soup.

The average person’s water requirements depend on many factors including age, activity level, and the humidity in the environment. The best way to ensure adequate hydration is to consume plenty of healthy fluids, including water, sparkling water, herbal tea and low-fat milk. Listen to your body and drink when you are thirsty rather than according to a predetermined formula or schedule.

Furthermore, if you are physically active or in an intensely hot climate, then it is important to replace your body’s lost fluids. After exercise, imbibe fluids that contain electrolytes as these help replenish electrolytes lost through sweating.

In short, there is no hard-and-fast rule for how much water you should drink for maintenance of good health. Every person’s hydration needs vary based on circumstances and activities. Generally speaking, listening to your body is a good indication of when and how much to drink. Adequate hydration is a part of a healthy lifestyle, so make sure that you drink when you’re thirsty and consume healthy fluids and electrolytes from other sources as well.
