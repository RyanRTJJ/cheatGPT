 in some centers; but this system was never adopted by those Manchus for whom the Manchu home was the sole social unit. Many of the early statesmen, who were not Manchu allies, remained loyal to Manchuria's Ming dynasty and had no wish to return to the centerland and hence it is very unlikely that the army ever constituted an important part of the state apparatus.

The first imperial campaigns against the Chinese were directed against the Manchu and other Manchu tribes who inhabited highlands and river valleys of the lower Indus delta basin on both coasts, but it was only during the middle period of Ming the Qing (1868-1912), when Manchu tribes fought alongside against Chinese tribes led by Chinggiso, that the Manchu, especially as a general people, came to dominate Manchu rule in Guangzhou at its peak. It has always been considered that with the defeat of China in 1859, Manchu influence over Manchuria began to decline. However, this assessment is very tentative. It is more believable that under the Manchu, Chinese rulers became more interested in their own interests as early as 1856. The early Manchus have always been the most efficient traders because they can negotiate with their Chinese neighbors in more than one way. Indeed, even though Chinese government had a monopoly over trade among the three states in the area, Chinese princes also took over large sections of the industry.

In recent years, despite the influence exercised by the former Ming (Qing) dynasty in Guangzhou and Tsinghua universities, the rise of Chinese nationalism has been a source of intense rivalry in which all ethnicities and religious groups have played an important role. Some researchers regard Chinese nationalism more as a religious system than as a political one. This religious system is the ancient belief in the divinity of one Chinese god, and it was first introduced by some Chinese dynasties who felt that they could no longer rely on the Manchus as protection against foreign infidesl, both from other religious groups and the non-Christian China. Other contemporary scholars of Chinese nationalism assume that only a minority of the state's population is concerned about how Chinese nationalism is developed and spread in the world and that Chinese nationalism
