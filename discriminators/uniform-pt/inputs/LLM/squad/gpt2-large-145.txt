ased human cells that are in a healthy state should be negative for infectious agent, but will provide enough organisms for a good test. In other words, testing for the presence of virus or bacteria is not performed from a culture or from a clinical sample.

Bacterial or viral infection is a particular problem in diagnostic tests because it is usually not the specific organisms that are detected that determine whether a person has the disease. In fact, the test for bacterial infection often requires more complex test procedures than that of a viral disease. The purpose of isolative testing for bacterial and viral infection is to identify the bacterium causing infection and how the bacterium infects and infects the body. A positive result from an isolate may not indicate the precise pathogen causing the infection or even its identity. Furthermore, a test for bacterial infection may not be applicable to other infections, even if the infection was caused by the same virus or bacterial organism. For example, if a person was exposed to a respiratory virus or bacterial infection that causes bronchospasm, he or she may not know that the viral or bacterial infection actually caused bronchospasm and that other medical conditions would also be expected. In these instances, isolation for a patient must be made to determine the exact pathogen of infection.

In the clinical setting, testing for infection often
