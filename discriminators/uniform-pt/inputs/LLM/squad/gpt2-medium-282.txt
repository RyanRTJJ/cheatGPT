en, an obscure figure of antiquity, had been the son—but not the only son—of Zeus; his brother Medusa has come to be regarded as the mother of the Olympian gods. His mother's name, of course, lies exclusively in Homer.

The Homeric source of this belief, as Homer is wont to tell it (e.g., i. 7.17; id. ii. 1), is a son of Hellen. For the gods are said to have descended from the head of the firstborn in one line to that of the last. The firstborn, he says, is called Nausicaa, and the last—the Olympian gods themselves. According also to Proteus, the wife of King Hormos, was the first-born of her master, Zeus, as a proof that even a slave of the one god could become a god. (Proteus, xiii. 8; vii. 2.)

The earliest writers, however, were not as certain as Homer, as some scholars who have been inclined towards a Greek origin, take the word nausica to mean the daughter of Zeus rather than the father of Athena; it is not difficult to trace earlier usage in other parts of Greece in association with the latter of the deities. Thus Homer's Theogony is translated by Plutarch as Κετίσκαβεσις (Naxos-Kylissis), and the Pindar, which does not seem to have been originally written by Homer, as the Greek nausica signifies, means the daughter of Helios. As the meaning of this name was already understood and understood well enough so that no doubt about its meaning, the Homeric writers regarded it as the only name, and called the divine offspring the Naxians.
