 House of Commons is typically appointed as president of the House of Commons.  While most political parties have their own representatives in the House of Commons (including the Prime Minister, Opposition leader and speaker), it is possible for the monarch to appoint their representative and a few other members of the royal household to the lower chamber. The appointment often takes place in the House of Lords rather than Parliament.

The Queen may give her Royal Assent to the Act, which has already been passed by the House of Lords. If the government seeks to make changes to the act before Royal Assent is given, it is referred to Royal Assent Committees. The first set of such committees were appointed in January 1635, following the Royal Assent of the Act of Assistance.

The monarch can give their assent by either writing or signing the document, but not by both. Royal assent is also given by signing a proclamation. A proclamation may not be returned from the privy council until it has been signed by the monarch on a special day set by Royal Signet, following a Royal Assent.

The original Royal Assent Act was drawn up by Charles II in 1635 and has been amended several times, the last of which was a 1798 statute. The act provides for the signing of the Act of Assistance by the first and last pages of the Royal Assent Book, by order of the Lord High Treasurer or the Lord President of the Council, and was referred to by the United Kingdom's Privy Council as one of the original Assent Acts.
