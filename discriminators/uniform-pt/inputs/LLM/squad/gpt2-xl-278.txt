 dogs. The game is primarily fish, including salmon, crabs, and various tropical fish. Several species of birds are also hunted.

The main target of the game hunters is the jaguar, which is primarily hunted at an altitude of 1500 metres or more. Jaguar hunting is carried out in sections with the rifle for two sections, and with the musket for one section. In some sections there are also snare traps set for the capture of wild pigs, which are then fattened and eaten as a delicacy.

The muskox are one of the most common game species throughout the country, with herds of about 8,000 a year being recorded. The hunt for muskox takes place in the areas of Viti Levu, Port-of-Spain and the Bay of Biscay. The game is also hunted at an altitude of 13,100 metres.

Hunting permits for the animal are available to individuals with some form of hunting permission in their countries (or to hunting companies, private individuals, or hunting councils). Hunting permits and licenses are subject to the requirements of local laws, while special regulations are imposed around hunting during the tourist season.

Hunting is available throughout the year, and in all seasons. However, the main season is the tourist season of December and June, and there is a two week break at the end of each of those months.
