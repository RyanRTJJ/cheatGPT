 set itself apart from the competition. Many Nintendo fans think that they did this by making the NES so different in appearance from other video game consoles. Nintendo has had many video game consoles since then, but the NES was, at the time of its release, the only console that was in a different design language.

Nintendoâ€™s unique design concept was so different from the other competing video game consoles, that it almost seemed that it was not a Nintendo product. The design of the game console itself was almost entirely a work of its designer, Shigeru Miyamoto.

Nintendo created a different, but very effective design aesthetic for its first game console, the Nintendo Entertainment System. Unlike all of the other video game consoles that were popular at the time, the Nintendo Entertainment System used a design concept that was different from the others. The NES was a simple console, but with some unusual styling. It used green, green, white and black as the primary colors for its body. Its buttons were also printed in green. Many fans believed that Nintendo purposely used the green, green, white and black colors for this purpose.

Fans of the NES believe that this styling was done on purpose. They point out that this design approach was chosen to stand out compared to the other video game consoles
