 (Paine, 1989). In 1859, Deism and Catholicism were joined by another 19th century American, Emerson, who called upon humankind to be freer and to be rid of the ‘mystifications’ of religion (Weisbuch 1994).

Today, Deism can also mean a naturalism in which one believes that religion is merely a product of the human race’s human nature. Indeed, many people in Europe, North America and Australia still use this definition and that of the Enlightenment (Holloway, 2007).

However, despite the intellectual developments within the human mind, science cannot be denied as an influence on the shaping of Western thought (Smith, 1979; Smith and Smith, 1991). Science led to a new perspective on religion, called ‘religion of science’ (RSC). RSC is the view that science will shape human values and behaviour to such an extent that the belief in God can no longer be considered to be natural (Bryson and Wilson, 2000).

The term ‘religion of science’ (RSC) was introduced by American theologian Robert P. George (1910-1998). RSC was described as the view that both Christianity and Darwin’s theory of evolution are religious in nature, particularly in the way they challenge the notion of God. A key problem is the human being’s belief in the existence of the soul, which has been accepted since medieval times (Doran, 2000; Smith, 1979: 5). A belief in the soul and a soul-based belief in God are often used as criteria in deciding what
