 houses the Noble Sanctuary and the Temple Mount where the Dome of the Rock is located.

"We think there is a very legitimate point to be made that the city isn't used for anything like a prayer service, that it is open for business and tourism purposes," he said.

The Supreme Court earlier this month rejected appeals by American Jewish groups seeking to prevent Trump from issuing a revised travel ban on people from six mainly Muslim countries.

The justices refused last week to hear an appeal from the Muslim-American Civil Liberties Union, which said the ban did not do enough to keep out those from a series of predominantly Muslim countries, despite the U.S. military's assertion that the ban will reduce the risk of terrorist attacks.

The revised executive order barred people with three types of "denied entry" visas, including those from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The new version also allowed people from the other six countries to enter.

"It was an attack on Muslims and on Israel that these refugees are fleeing: I can't imagine a better target for Daesh (Islamic State group) terrorists," said Yaakov Litzman of the New Israel Fund. "How can it not be a concern?"
