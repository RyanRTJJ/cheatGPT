If the recording was deemed great enough, the record may have been pressed a second time with a different lead in it so more copies could be made. Some records were so high quality that they never fractured and some records did not fracture until well after they were over a half century old.

There have been some very unusual early records that were made of glass, a very soft and expensive material that was not normally used for pressing records.
