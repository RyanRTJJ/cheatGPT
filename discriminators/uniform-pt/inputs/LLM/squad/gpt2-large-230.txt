 the "breeding" plumage is termed "fusillade" plumage, or the "non-breeding" plumage is referred to as the "pre-breeding" plumage (or, if a bird is pre-breeding, as "primary moult").

A young red turkey's plumage is usually just a thickening, or fusing, of various layers that occur when the turkey is young, as the bird ages and the layers are broken down and replaced; it can be an even process over time.

Young Red Turkey and Black-browed Turkey

The plumage of the baby red or black-browed turkey can be a dark fuming (like a plumage of an African blackbird), or a lighter, somewhat flatter, fuming plumage, which takes place when a bird is young. (A bird that is pre-breeding is a non-breeding plumage due to having moulted later on.)

Black-browed turkeys, called black-breasted or "mama" turkeys, are larger than their red-, or non-breeding, counterpart, so their plumages are much more elaborate and well-developed. Like most turkey species, black-browed turkeys have very dark-colored eye-seams and a dark coloration across the eye, on their breast, thighs, and the underbellies with no trace of white; the eye-seams themselves are darker in black-breasted turkeys than white-breasted, or non-breeding, turkeys (black-breasted turkeys have no black coloration on the breast except where the bird may have lost some feathers). Black-breasted turkeys, like other turkey species, also have two black spots in a circle shape (see picture).

The black-breasted turkey looks the most intimidating to most people, for two reasons; first is that there are some black spots on its breast (and therefore on its under-bellies.) Second, because of their red underbellies, black-breasts sometimes look similar to "brown-breasted" blackbirds, as brown and
