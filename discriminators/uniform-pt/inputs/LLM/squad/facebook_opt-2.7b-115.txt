 cappella works are usually thought to be Christian, but there were many other faiths. In the 19th century, when German Protestantism and other Protestant sects were losing strength, they started forming their own ensembles, many of which had elements of secular composition. Some of these ensembles had secular or secularist music, some did not.

When I was a teenager in the 1950s, we had a very popular choral group, the Eastside Chorale, in Los Angeles. It did some secular stuff, such as the "Ride of the Valkyries." But it mostly did Christian music. Some people thought it was kind of cheesy, but it was great for raising a curtain of sound that was just awesome.

It is not easy to find information about some of the more interesting pieces. The following is a sampling of an article by David Miller, called Musical Secularism in the 19th Century. It describes a large group of composers in Germany who wrote secular works in Germany and later transferred them to Switzerland. These composers were in contrast to Bach, who was strongly religious and secular in his compositional process.

Christian polyphony developed in the 18th century and was generally considered to be the musical heritage of Christian Germany and Protestantism, while the secular music was the legacy of the Schiller-led Schillerum movement in Switzerland.

A great work of polyphony was composed by Jakob Steinsiedel in German in the 1790's, and dedicated to Friedrich Schiller. It was a great success at the time. He later moved to Switzerland, where he composed the great work, The Triumph of Music. This also received considerable acclaim, and was the main focus of a tour around Switzerland in 1796-7, when Johann David Wagner was not yet famous. The work was performed at the Zurich concert in September 1797 as part of the festival celebrating Schiller's 200th
