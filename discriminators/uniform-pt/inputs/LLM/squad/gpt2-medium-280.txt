In 1873, the University of Waterloo first used a rotary engine to drive a wheel bearing that would spin up to 60 degrees with an electric current. In 1877, Carnegie Institution funded the development in London of the first electric motor of any kind to replace the wooden gear-driven wheel. The motor worked by a piston-rod mechanism.

The first modern electric automobile was driven by Nikola Tesla in 1875. A successful campaign began in 1895, when Tesla released an updated version of his original model, the Model T, which had been completed in 1875. Tesla sold half a million copies of his electric car in its first year of existence, but over the next 40 years the electric motor took over its role as a consumer's favorite vehicle.

Most of the first American electric vehicles were prototypes. They were usually modified from the Model T with the addition of additional battery cells and an additional motor to make them more expensive to produce. In 1926, the American electric car company the Edison Electric Vehicle Company (later known as General Motors) began mass producing models of its Model T. From 1925 to 1933, the Model T produced approximately 3,000,000 automobiles globally. Tesla's Model T had an average speed of 90 miles (145 km) per hour and made over 2 and a half cents per mile.

Electric and electric vehicles became increasingly useful together after the mass production of the
