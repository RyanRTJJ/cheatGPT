) per year. The cultivation of the crop requires that the plants are kept dry by irrigation facilities. Most cotton cultivation in India in the past was either dry or flood irrigation, but in recent years dry cultivation has been the principal mode. Irrigation is usually carried out in summer to avoid excessive heat, and rainfall is often used intermittently. After harvest, the cotton and its by-products are usually transported on a single cargo train from the fields to an allied production site. At the production site raw cotton is processed to textile fiber via a wet cotton carding machine. Carding generally proceeds through the use of water to keep the fibrous cotton web free from lint and to aid in the removal of large dust particles. The textile fiber is then manufactured by various processes which result in the manufacture of the finished goods, such as fabrics. The bulk cotton is first separated from its water-insoluble impurities of which it is composed. The separated cotton is then bleached and deinking is carried out to convert the cotton into a white, homogeneous material, suitable for textile manufacture.
The term "bleaching" when used herein is meant to include not only chemical processes such as those described by Miller and Webster as well as various enzyme and oxidizing bleaching techniques but also an "irritation treatment using air" described by K.
