 River to Sichuan border. On September 7, Chinese soldiers were in action against Japanese infantry when American troops broke through the north wall of the village and took over control. The assault on the Japanese position on the west side turned into a fierce battle to avenge their lost officers and soldiers. Japanese forces were driven back and sent across the lake, taking Chinese citizens hostage and then disposing of them by shooting. In Sichuan, they continued the assault while attempting to take the city itself from the hands of Chinese resistance. The Japanese were then confronted by Americans; Japanese troops fell back to the north of the town as Chinese reinforcements arrived from the south. Japanese captured several Chinese towns and villages on the southern banks of the Wusuan River and set fire to the towns. The American forces held the city as a prisoner of war camp for several weeks before leaving the area. Finally, on November 19, the final Japanese retreat was halted by Chinese reinforcements.

While the battle at Yueyang represented a decisive victory for the allied force, it did not end Chinese resistance to the Americans. It ended with the Battle of the Koyan area, with Japanese troops recapturing the town of Tianjin in August 1945 (one of the last major battles of World War II).

The situation at Nanjing worsened when the Japanese began their offensive after capturing the city and the surrounding districts on February 20. Within the first 20 minutes the Nanjing garrison
