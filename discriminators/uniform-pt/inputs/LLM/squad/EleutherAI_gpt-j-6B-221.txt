 Studios chief, Bill Price, who wrote the album's first song with Mercury, "This Boy", was heavily involved with Queen's next album, Innuendo.

The group also recorded "Another One Bites The Dust" for the "A-Team" video, but it is rarely released due to a contractual dispute between Queen and the band. It also appeared on the soundtrack of the film, A Bridge Too Far. This single marked the final appearance of drummer Roger Taylor, who left to form a short-lived band, Bad Company (with whom he would later appear on his final album, Queen II, and in his current band, Them), and it was Roger Taylor's first contribution as a member of Queen.

After the successful Innuendo studio album, Queen's next record was to be a double album titled A Day at the Races. However, the group had difficulty reaching agreement with record labels, and the album was not released until two years later.

A Day at the Races was released on 11 September 1984 in the UK and on 17 April 1985 in the US and Canada.  It was available only on vinyl in the UK - for the first time. In the US, it was the first album to go platinum (1 million sold) and stayed in the Top 10 for 15 weeks (up to a Top 20 Billboard chart appearance with the single "These Are the Days of Our Lives", also released on a Day at the Races re-recording of the 1983 single "Keep Yourself Alive").

A Day at the Races was the Queen album with the largest number of co-writer contributions of all Queen albums. It has 10 songwriter credits. In all, 4 of the 9 members are credited with a songwriting contribution. All of the members are credited - except Brian May - who is credited as keyboardist, as he was doing most of the keyboard work. Also notable is that all the songs are credited to
