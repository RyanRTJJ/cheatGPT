In July 2013, the property received a $1.9 billion grant and a major redevelopment plan is ongoing. Two years later, the property is still waiting for an official $1 billion or more in casino revenues in addition to state and city tax funding. Morgan Stanley plans to break ground on the property in the first quarter 2016.

The casino also plans to renovate the existing Showboat Hotel's existing dining and entertainment venues, including the Grand Ballroom, along with transforming the adjacent North and South sides of the building into entertainment, shopping, housing, and retail space.

At the southern end of the property, the showboat will be converted into luxury residences and hotels, with a number of condominiums.

The casino was originally set to open in 2015, only to have it delayed until 2016 due to funding shortfalls.

Despite these challenges, the casino is expected to be a significant source of income for the city and residents. According to the Atlantic City Economic Development Corp., Atlantic City has the highest concentration of Fortune 500 corporate headquarters in the country.

"This new casino will be the largest in the state and by far in the industry," said the state's Casino Control, which includes those that are approved for Atlantic City.

"It has the capacity to generate a record-setting annual revenue of $50 million and is expected to have a positive fiscal impact on the city."

In addition to being more profitable to operate, the new casinos also create up to 100,000 jobs across
