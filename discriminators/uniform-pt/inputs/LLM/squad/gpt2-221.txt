 (pictured front and centre) said their success made them the "most talked about" musical of them all. "When we did Bohemian Rhapsody at the very first London show, we did say 'OK!' - that makes you wonder where we got that first album!" said Mercury's Michael. "We just loved it. I'm so glad it was released that day, it did feel like we'd done something really special that wasn't normally a big deal. Everyone's been so excited about it we just loved it. We're still getting going, just as we were doing on the first album. It's a very different sound. There's loads of ideas and ideas of songs that are still quite fun and they're still all just ideas. There's a lot more coming right now." Meanwhile, the band were looking at a record deal with Sony on the heels of their success in Europe. "We're pretty pleased they're here," said Michael. "We've been sitting as a label on a new record deal and being on record for about seven weeks and working on a whole series of new songs. It's been awesome! We've been working on a series of new albums for the past six weeks. "We're just happy, just as we've been working on other albums."
