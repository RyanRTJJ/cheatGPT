 status that goes beyond that of mere belief. This has led Popper to call knowledge an "integrity concept," as opposed to a "subjective" concept. This in turn has been the occasion for much controversy. In particular, it has been debated if Popper's objective epistemological approach is a form of "logical positivism," and if for him (as for some philosophers of science) the concepts of "objective" and "subjective" in the sense of ontological status are synonymous with those of truthlikeness and knowledge. Here I will limit myself to the discussion (at least theoretically) of Popper's objective epistemological account that has received the most scholarly attention, and I will follow the lead of Richard M. Gale and Robert M. Fogelson, in the interpretation of Popper's epistemological account of knowledge.

The logical positivists, of whom Popper was the most prominent proponent in Britain at the time he wrote his book, were among the most prominent champions of an objective epistemological approach to knowledge. Logical positivists adopted many tenets of scientific and analytic philosophy and were critical of positivist epistemological approaches that had been popular in the 1930s. However, they agreed that the concept of knowledge had become corrupted and that it was necessary, as Popper put it, to recover what had become obscured and lost in the process. The key notion in Popper's account of knowledge is that it is possible to gain a
