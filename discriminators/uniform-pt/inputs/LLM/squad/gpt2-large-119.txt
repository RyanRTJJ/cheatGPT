 duchy of Lorraine and possibly the Duchy of Orleans. The king was also looking to unite France into an alliance with the Germans, whom he expected to be the primary threat against the king's dynasty. John was, however, concerned by the fact that his sons died while campaigning.

On 14 May 1202 King John III of France, Count of Anjou, sent a letter to Philip II, informing him that he was leaving Anjou for Normandy and declaring that he would take all of Normandy. Philip II refused the invitation, as had been his practice in past, and John and his knights marched towards the French side of the river Tournois instead. At this point the king was given warning: the French king Philip II was on his way to take control of Anjou under an order from Boniface IX, the duke of Bavaria (a person John recognized as his nephew). The duke was headed to Normandy to begin a crusade and the king was on his way to fight it. The king's army encountered a French army approaching the river Tournois on the night of 15 May. A duel followed which ended with Philip II being drowned while John and his sons were wounded and killed. As a result, John was given the posthumous honour of being crowned king of France.

King John III of France was elected king in 1203. After his coronation, he made a number of important changes to the French kingdom.
