A study by Ehsan et al. (2013) of a sample of European Jews has identified a very few individuals who migrated in isolation from their original European Jewish core population. Analyses of these DNA sequences reveal the descendants of these individuals to have lived in Europe, and their descendants to have lived in Israel today. However, the estimated number of males to have migrated in this lineage is not very high (3â€“5% of the Jewish population) because about 40% of these individuals are likely descendants of Jews who lived in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages.

A comprehensive analysis of population history of Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews, which has expanded the population analysis into three ancient civilizations (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) reveals a different picture of the population composition of these groups. From the archaeological evidence of the ancient Ashkenazi communities (Sufaric, Arab, and Ottoman), there is clearly a Jewish core population of more than 5 million males who made Jerusalem their home. But this core population would have been smaller than it is today due to the relative ease of crossing the Iron Wall. As far as is known, the last great Yiddish migration of the Ashkenazi survivors happened between 400 and 550 CE, when the Jews in the Negev became one of
