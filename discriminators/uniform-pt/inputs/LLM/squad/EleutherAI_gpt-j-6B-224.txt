i’s point seems to be in part correct but it must be borne in mind that a number of the concepts derived from the madrasa had precedents in non-Islamic systems (e.g. in the East Roman empire).

The European “university of the mind” did, nevertheless, make many substantial borrowings from medieval Islamic science in the area of medicine, physics and biology and even mathematics when they formulated modern physics. The latter is the most important in relation to the current discussion as it is in many ways more complex and difficult to grasp than other Islamic sciences and has much overlap with modern Western physics, though they have different origins.

One of these areas is in the concept of relativity. In the West it was known since Galileo but this knowledge was lost to Europe until the time of the Renaissance where Aristotle was rediscovered. In the Renaissance the first modern mathematician to write on Newton’s theory of gravity (Mersenne) based his work on it on Aristotle’s Physics.

Galileo, however, developed much greater understanding of how matter operates and this led to his formulation of the laws of dynamics (the theory of inertia). In the Renaissance European science moved from the concept of a static realm, that did not change except over time, to a dynamic one. The first major exponent of this was Galileo. Other such thinkers included Kepler who understood the law of universal gravitation (Kepler’s laws). This was confirmed independently by Newton who invented, based on Kepler’s laws, his own theory of mechanics. Newton’s laws have been confirmed by Einstein who extended and developed these laws.

These were all developments in a “static” realm or in the pre-relativity domain. Einstein discovered something
