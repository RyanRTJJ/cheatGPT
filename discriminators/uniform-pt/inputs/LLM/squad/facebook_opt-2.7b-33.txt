 the southern coast. This is a world of many traditions and religions, as well as an unusually high amount of culture. The cultural aspect is a bit more open than that of much of the rest of the empire however, and it is common to find examples of each religion from different cultures or time periods in Thuringia.

There are nine major religions in Thuringia:

Christianity

Roman Catholicism

Jewish Christianity

Hinduism

Arabic Islamic

Confucianism

Rabbit-Head Wicca

Buddhism

Hinduism is the most present in the Thuringian highlands. Buddhism and Persian Islam were common in the middle region, while the Germanic faiths are common in the southern areas.

The main language in Thuringia is the Germanic Yiddish language, also known as "Eish", "Ei√ü", "Uerisch" or "Uwe" (translates in english as "yid", although it has a strong regional and gender distinction, and is considered dialectal and/or archaic by linguists). However, the language is also present and widely spoken all over Europe and is taught in school from the 3rd grade upwards. English and French are also widely taught, as well as some Latin.

Thuringia also has its own written language. This language, called "Thuringian", was created as an independent, parallel, unalphabetized branch of German, and thus can be written using the same Latin system as German. However, Thuringian is more closely related to Latin as a script, and is most commonly used by professional historians, writers, and such in this region. It is considered a more advanced, complex variant of Latin than most other European languages, and still continues to provide the language of most of the higher classes. It is only rarely seen as the official language in written books or official documents.
