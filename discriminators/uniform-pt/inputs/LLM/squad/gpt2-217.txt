 for example, could be dominated by either a single or a two-tier ecosystem with unique species, while India and Southeast Asia would also have different flora and fauna with different levels of genetic diversity. At the other end of the scale, North America, with much smaller diversity but more complex environments, could have different environments with different species and cultures. In many cases this could be argued for as a one-way street and a two-way highway; but perhaps they would have different populations and communities.

So how does this work? The researchers studied a wide range of ecological samples with no evidence of population differences. They also examined patterns of distribution and other potential explanations that might be related to the different ecosystems. They explored differences in biodiversity to see whether changes in plant and animal communities may cause different levels of population differentiation within a given region.

They looked at different species within a geographically specific population where differences can be driven by variations in the amount of land that each species occupies on average. In their paper, they argue that they have discovered how the distribution of different populations can vary by climate and habitat type. The researchers suggest this is the real deal and could lead to population declines in the South American continent over the next century.

However, many of these papers already
