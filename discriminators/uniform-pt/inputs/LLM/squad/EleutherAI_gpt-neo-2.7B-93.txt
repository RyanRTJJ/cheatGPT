 about the origins of the Sephardic Jews, who number just over six million worldwide.

Richards and his colleagues found that European DNA — found in the Y-chromosome DNA of Ashkenazi Jews, who make up about 12 percent of the world’s Jewish population — could have arrived in the Jewish community through several distinct, partially overlapping journeys. In a paper published online Feb. 4 in Science, the researchers report the latest findings of their work, which they began in 1990.

“Our study found multiple points of origin for the European haplogroup,” Richards said. “For Europeans, the initial events that seeded the Ashkenazi population are spread through at least two different routes to the Sephardic population.”

The process first occurred at the end of the last ice age more than 10,000 years ago, when people first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula. From there, some of them made the 3- to 6-month journey to North Africa, where they settled in a coastal region. From there another third took the 10- to 25-day trip to the Maghreb, on Africa’s western coast, and on to the Iberian Peninsula.

After arriving in the Iberian Peninsula, several people then made the 2- to 5-day journey back to Spain in what are known as reticulated migrations, or by a term they use in Europe, a “reticulation route.” This was likely the route taken by the first Ashkenazi Jews to arrive in Spain.

The second phase of European mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) migration to Spain and the Maghreb took place roughly 400 years later, during the late Byzantine period (6th century
