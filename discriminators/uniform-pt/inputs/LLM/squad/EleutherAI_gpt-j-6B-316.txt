oths can detect specific molecular compounds in odours. Insects can also sense and respond to changes in gravity and acceleration. These sensory mechanisms are often linked with the insects' flight behaviours.

As the world's smallest flying insect, the jewel wasp has a high tolerance for flightlessness. Its hind wings are vestigial and only used for mating.

The female of the species Epiphyas diana (Epiphyas diana) is known for its ability to fly up to 300 km/hour when escaping an attack. The jewel wasp uses its elongated antennae to feel when prey is nearby. It then flies up high and catches the prey with a sharp, venomous sting and then bites off its head and sucks out the venom. While high-flying, the insect is able to detect a slight increase in the atmospheric density. It flies downwards and changes its position slightly at a rate of one to two meters per second, while maintaining a steady speed.
