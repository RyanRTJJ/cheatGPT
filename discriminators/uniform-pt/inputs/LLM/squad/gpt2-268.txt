 book that was unique for its different academic cultures, and that the different statutes, which can in the United States still be considered somewhat similar or different by many students, tended to differ in different ways, sometimes through a "parchment and a stone" language used much earlier, and sometimes in different regions of the United States for different use.

The American Academy of Arts and Letters (AZA) and the American Institute of Arts, who are largely credited for the publication of the first two versions of their statutes, agreed that they were the first of their kind. In 1686, the new language of law for the United States contained an exception. However, this exception would go into effect in 1786 and will apply in 1816, and in 1816 and 1818 the language used in 1786 would make it legal for professors in schools to teach as English or British; students of different learning levels were exempt from the new law language.

In 1814 the federal courts in Chicago, New York and Massachusetts decided that academic standards for students of different learning levels should be set at least in part in accordance with the law, and that their standards, regardless of where they are from, should be judged according to the laws of the country they belong to. Many academic and law schools in the United States also agreed these principles, because they shared the responsibility for enforcing these principles and for creating statutes requiring such schools to use the laws of the country they were based abroad. To ensure that the academic standards reflected the law, many federal law courts created statutes that set school and state standards and did not set a single statute level.

Today, the American College Association is led by the members of the American Association of University Professors. Its website states in part:
