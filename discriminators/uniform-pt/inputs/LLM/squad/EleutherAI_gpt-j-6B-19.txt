's back catalogue, and the band's 'comeback' album Slip of the Tongue (1992) reaching 10 gold albums in the US. In 1992, the label signed Metallica who became Mercury's biggest sellers of the year, selling 11 million with the album Black Album (1989). The label had some major hits with the bands of hard rock, which Mercury felt would not benefit from his newly found commercial acumen. There was the success of Lenny Kravitz, who achieved three top 5 hits on the US Hot 100 with Raise V.D., Fly and Are You Gonna Go My Way (from the soundtrack to the film The Player).

The band did not do so well on the Billboard 200 chart with their fourth album, but it sold well enough for the album to go platinum in the US. Another act on Mercury's roster who were initially disappointed were the US rock band Poison. They were signed when the band changed their name from Mother Moon and then back to Poison as it appeared on their new album, Flesh and Blood (1990). The album peaked at No. 3 on the US album sales chart and No. 11 on the Billboard 200. It was the first of only two studio albums by the band to see a US No. 1 on the album chart. Although it did not fare as well in the UK, it became the band's best-selling album.

1990–1993: Expansion and diversification

In the 1990s, Mercury was no longer the music industry giant in the US, as by 1993, RCA had overtaken him. He was forced to make some substantial changes. The first was the replacement of the long-time VP of marketing, Mike Hoch, and the subsequent change of image. The group was brought back from its "party time", and it was decided a new marketing emphasis would be needed to get artists like the Smiths and Nirvana who were not as successful as they had anticipated a more
