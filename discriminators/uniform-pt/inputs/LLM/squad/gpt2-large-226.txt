 records are in the form of books or, as in psychoanalysis, in the form of the unconscious. A literary tradition can be seen as such a record of cultural processes, whether the records are narratives, whether the records involve poems or philosophical essays, whether the records are the works of artists or dramatists or sculptors. The writing of a "literature of history" can be seen as such a record of a society, both when the society itself is written or when societies are written.

It may be true, however, as one might expect, that the great writer had no need of literary literature. He did not need the great authors for his purpose of providing narrative, as Plato wrote his Symposium before the invention of the dramatic form, or as Aristotle wrote his Treatise on Poetics before the invention of the literary form. Literature did not even originate in the writing of the great names who created this form of writing. Writing of the great is merely what it is. However, that literary tradition did have a record, a record that existed for centuries before the invention of writing, and it can be found there in the written records of the great writers. The book of Genesis records the history of the world, for instance. It is a record of a society and a record of things that have happened in that society. This may seem to be an obvious fact. But it can be demonstrated, in fact, if one so desires, that there existed among the great men of the ancient world a tradition of history that was not historical at all. This has been established, for example, by the recent study of Herodotus, the legendary Greek historian. Herodotus was a writer of mythic characters, but his writings have had a record: an oral record in Greek and in Latin translations to which the text-historians of later times have translated all the things he wrote. The Greek translations, like a
