 might be useful in camouflage as an anti-predator strategy, but the biological differences between hair and skin and hair and feathers make the use of colored feathers problematic. The following sections discuss several important aspects of the issue, including (1) color change on the scale as a measure of a system's efficiency, (2) the function of the scales and feathers in the development of flight, (3) the mechanisms that contribute to variation in scale and feather distribution along the entire length of a plant, and (4) the functions of scales and feathers in the reproductive cycle.

Changes in Color on the Scale as a Measure of a System's Efficiency In organisms with light-colored scales on the scale surface, as in many insects, scales serve as important visual signals, such as camouflage. For example, some species employ colored scales in part for visual camouflage [2], while others use them as camouflage in that they may appear more similar to the background than to the body or, depending on the size, to more similar objects when viewed from above or behind [3,4]. Many insects can perceive their own colors, so that, for example, if they see an alien butterfly, they will often be able to recognize it as a relative of their own species, or a different species entirely. In these cases, color contrast between the insects and other background objects (e.g., the background plant) serves as an effective means to signal species identity, although the visual effect usually fails if the insects are viewed through a cloudy or poor-quality lens. For these insects, color contrast on the scale may serve as a more efficient means to signal species identity [5], such as if the scales
