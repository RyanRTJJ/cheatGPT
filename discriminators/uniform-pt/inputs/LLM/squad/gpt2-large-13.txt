 is often attributed to the hair and head of an individual of the population or to differences in hair quality or pigmentation. More frequent pigmentation of hair may appear to be indicative of different dietary requirements, greater genetic distance, or differences in the relative frequency of particular pigmentation genes. Light-dark color variation occurs in many animal species and is usually related to differences in nutritional and environmental factors (1). As an example, a variety of pigmentation genes in birds have been found in northern European bats (2) and it is reasonable to suppose that variation in the color variation of human hair also reflects variations in nutritional requirements, environmental enrichment, or other factors, as has been suggested. To clarify the question of what is the source of the variation in human hair color, we compared the phenotypic properties of a group of 6 Caucasian volunteers and found that all of them had slightly lighter colored hair on average than the average of the other Caucasian subjects (Table ). Table 1. Hair characteristics, height, skin color, age, body mass index, and body composition of the 6 Caucasians.

Data from the 6 Caucasian volunteers are shown in Table. For each subject, he or she was classified into a control group whose hair was obtained from a normal male donor (n = 5), the group which used the same artificial dye but with less color than indicated in the table (n = 6), and the group of which he or she received a normal colored hair from the male who donated hair (n = 6). Control groups were not compared to either another control group or to the hair color of the donor. The subjects in the
