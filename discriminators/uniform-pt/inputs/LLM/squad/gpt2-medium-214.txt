 (Japan only), introduced Digimon Masters, a series that featured the series' first main protagonists and a first preview of Digimon Savers, a digimon companion to the anime. Digimon Masters, which ran from November 1998 to December 1999, follows the adventure of two humans who manage to use their powers. Digimon Savers, which ran from November 1999 to January 2000, introduced a new character dubbed "Hakutani," who will appear in the television series. Each Digimon series was split into three part-timers: the first one would begin in early season 1999, followed by Digimon Masters that ran from April to May, and then Digimon Adventures that ran from June to July.
