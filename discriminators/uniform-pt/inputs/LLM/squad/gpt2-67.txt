 Olympics as an alternative to the NFL. He has also been an Olympic fan, including when he beat the world record in an Olympics last June. In 1986, he became the first man to become the first man ever to complete a marathon without missing a finish. He moved to Houston with his wife and children to do the distance marathons. Over his career, Schwarzenegger has also enjoyed fame; his first television appearance ran as part of the 1984 movie Trainwreck. In 1987, he gave talks at the American Bar, a club in Texas. On the evening of the show, Schwarzenegger said of the audience that he was a "great friend" and asked the audience, "What about you?" the crowd responded "I love you." That same evening, he gave a radio interview to CNN about his wife, Susan, the celebrity they spent summers on. He also gave interviews on The Tonight Show, the radio show of the same name, and had talks with many politicians and sports personalities. On his first TV appearance, Schwarzenegger hit the streets of Los Angeles with his mother in 1987. On his first stop at an airport there was a man who ran in his mother's face and killed him -- he gave his mother a hug. On the way to Los Angeles, he ran out of his own money on a taxi to find his own money. The taxi driver was Jerry Seinfeld, an actor who played Seinfeld on NBC's The Late Show and on its late-night shows. Schwarzenegger got to hang out with him on the red carpet by taking pictures. Schwarzenegger's daughter, Cindy, took him in for a look at her children and asked his questions. They watched a movie with Schwarzenegger that they were about to watch while he worked at his old company, General Motors. They watched some of the movies on the set. Schwarzenegger's personal trainer, Mark Reis, who runs a massage equipment company in Los Angeles, helped him take pictures of his little dog, which is owned by the same family that took him on a tour of the country in 1983.
