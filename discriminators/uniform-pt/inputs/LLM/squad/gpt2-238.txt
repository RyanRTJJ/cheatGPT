 into a metaphysics of the senses, since they could not be reconciled with statements about our feelings and actions. Here the claim that there is no physical thing (i.e. human being) with its physical appearance is also discredited (Bodenbaum 1988).

Further, we now have the possibility to use a more complicated account of material and emotional experience to determine if there is an actual physical thing (e.g., a "soul"), or rather a concept or being-associated (e.g., a "matter") with something that looks like a thing (see Rolodnik 1976). In doing so, we can also understand how other kinds of experiences, such as consciousnesses, are treated by Hume â€” and which of these can be accepted for a "physical substance" to be called "being or something else." (Bodenbaum 1988: 46-49). We can also look for evidence that other kinds of experiences, such as sense phenomena like language and consciousnesses, are treated as being or different. For, like Hume, we are faced with a great deal of philosophical tension over which aspects of the empirical and social realm are different: is a "thing" and a "person" just as different? Similarly, is consciousness a natural thing because "it is a person"? Or, as Gershman and Hartzler have put it, is there really a distinction between physical and metaphysically different things? This would mean looking for evidence that there is neither anything else, and perhaps even a claim on which to base an answer.

There are two problems
