. Each banner was distinguished with a flag, which was a combination of a color and an brocade animal. In total, there were eight banners and each banner was made up of a combination of Manchu and Mongol groups, as well as some Chinese bind-servants who were attached to the banner's Manchu masters. Manchu banners, unlike Mongol banners, were divided into company-level organizations within each banner, with a flag leader and commander at the head of each one. Mongol banners were divided into peltries, each one representing a clan or family. Banners changed frequently as emperors and their households changed, and as new banners were created to absorb new peoples into Manchu rule.
