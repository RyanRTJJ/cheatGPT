 who supported Innocent's cause, and those who were pro-King.

It was during this conflict that King Henry and his supporters captured Rome. King Henry's victory, however, was tempered by Innocent's defeat at Milvian Bridge, leaving Henry to be crowned as the King of England in 1215.

After the death of the last Pope, the title of papal conclave, in the year 1257, was held in the Roman College in the Sistine Chapel until 1279.

In November 1279, after the election of Peter thuriferius to succeed Innocent III as Pope (this was the first time that a foreigner had held this position).

The conclave in Santa Maria Sistina resumed in October 1279, but the election was postponed until 1282 because the pope fell ill.

In the meantime, the Roman Congregation of the Council of Trent had produced the Reformaticum Decree of Trent, which established that the Holy See should no longer interfere in the day-to-day affairs of the Church.

These changes were unpopular with the clergy of England. When Pope John XXI issued the bull Liber Pontificalis on 5 August 1282, the English and Scottish Barons tried to prevent its entry into force by blocking the streets near the gate of the St. Peter's Palace.

Many English nobles had also supported Innocent's cause.

Pope John XXI was forced to call a conclave. Innocent's supporters, including King Henry, however, were not willing to accept the pope's resignation and therefore the Pope attempted to force the pope's resignation through the use of the interdict.[3][4]
