) usually represents the transition to reproductive adulthood \[[@CR1]--[@CR3]\] and often corresponds to the end of pubertal growth spurt \[[@CR1]--[@CR3]\]. Likewise, menopause (the cessation of menstrual cycling) is a hallmark of successful aging because the attainment of reproductive adulthood usually is completed before the end of the fertile years \[[@CR3]--[@CR5]\]. The timing of first sexual intercourse, in addition to age, is considered crucial in determining reproductive success because sexual activity and reproductive success become closely entwined as one ages \[[@CR4]\]. Likewise, women's capacity to conceive, be able to carry to term, and give birth remain critical to a woman's successful life course \[[@CR6]\]. Likewise, sexual activity among humans continues throughout the life course (as evidenced by the high rates of sexual activity and reproduction among the elderly) \[[@CR4]\].

In contrast to the emphasis placed on sexual activity around the transition to reproductive adulthood in developed countries, in parts of the developing world, sexual activity of adolescent girls and women is delayed until after menopause, which is a common phenomenon in most cultures \[[@CR7], [@CR8]\]. In some rural areas of the developing world, women and girls undergo early menarche (10--13 years old), delayed first sexual intercourse (∼14 years old), and early menopause (∼45 years old) \[[@CR7], [@CR8]\]. These early reproductive milestones, which have long been considered normal for adolescents and young adults in rural communities, are being increasingly recognized in developed countries \[[@CR3], [@CR9], [@CR10]\].

It is not surprising that the average age of menopause differs from population to population; it is also not unexpected that the average age of onset and first sexual intercourse is increasing in some developing countries \[[@CR7], [@CR8]\]. In rural Africa, some villages have the earliest age of menarche (∼6 years) and age of first sexual intercourse (∼13
