 the hospital, a single parent who neglects his daughter. Harry Crosby, who played Peter Pan in Peter Pan was a bit of a troublemaker, and Peter Pan was a bit of a scamp. Banning and Crosby were not in the picture. When I read the script for Hook, I thought it was all about the relationship the young boy had with his mother.

But then I saw the film (which he had no script control on), and I realized that we were following the same formula of tension that had played so beautifully in other film musicals of the period like Singin’ In the Rain, Brigadoon and Oklahoma! The story is about a young boy growing up, struggling with his parents, who don’t seem to be able to communicate with him and he becomes rebellious—he is even in love too young. He runs away, and then, of course, the parents find him and they are faced with these big dramatic moments that have been brewing since the first movie they saw on the big screen.

Peter Banning (Hook) with his speech “How did this little thing grow so big?”

And last but not least, Peter Pan himself (or Peter
