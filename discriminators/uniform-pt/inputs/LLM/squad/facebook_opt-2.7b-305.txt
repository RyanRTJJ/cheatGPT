 years. It occurs both in captive populations and in wild populations. Typically the captive population includes a mixture of wild and captive populations (though it may, by definition, also include all wild and captive pairs). However, in some cases it is possible to identify a single captive population and to estimate the proportion of hybridising between it and wild-captive pairs to achieve a certain genetic mixture. Hybridisation is considered a potentially significant threat to animal species which have evolved to inhabit certain habitats and to be sensitive to some disturbance, as it may significantly disrupt their ability to move and/or communicate with one another in their natural habitat. This application relates to determining the extent of hybridisation and the potential deleterious effects on one or more species by selecting for a preferred population from a hybridising population (for example by selection of animals having a high percentage of hybrid embryos).
Hepatic hemosiderin-trans-3-phosphatidylcholine (PTCI) is a protein of the glycoprotein glycoprotein IIb/IIIa family which is important for the development of the liver. Humans have two different isoforms of the isoform (Ib-1 and Ib-2) of PTCI, both of which have been thought to be necessary for fetal liver development. The Ib-2 protein can be expressed in the livers of mice and dogs and functions as a hepatocyte growth factor (1, 3-5), a hepatocyte stimulator factor (6, 7), and is also expressed by endodermal endothelial cells. It induces the transcription of an interferon gene gene known as IFNs (8) and plays an important role in the development of hepatocytes and liver cells and in regulating the response of immune cells to hepatocyte cells (9). The Ib-1 protein was previously assumed to be a secondary effector of the Ib-2 protein (10), but the roles of both isoforms remain relatively unknown.
Currently several genes encoding polypeptides of hepatic hemosiderin-trans-3-phosphatidylcholine have been isolated:
