 in the 14-15 kyr ago and remained active for a few decades, but were largely contained as the island was shaped by glaciation, volcanic eruptions and climatic events). It possesses over 20,000 islands, and is surrounded by more than 130 islands, and is known as a 'territory of islands'.

It lies under the influence of the North Pacific, which is called the Northern Ocean because the cold air from the Gulf of Alaska has a lot of moisture and therefore has warmed temperatures, which have kept the water temperature higher and so has created a warmer continental air.
