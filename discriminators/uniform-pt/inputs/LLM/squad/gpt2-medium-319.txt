 out that Islamic universities were a reaction to a secularization crisis of the European Union (EU) and a globalised world economy during the early modern period (i.e., the end of the medieval era; see above, pp. 13-14 for discussion of the impact of Muslim expansion in North Africa). However, the European experience with medieval institutions seems to include more complex forms of Muslim influence on Muslim institutions, ranging from highly informal institutions (for example, Muslim universities in the Middle East, for which a clear secularization crisis was likely) to formal, monastic Islamic institutions which have continued in existence until the early modern period (for example, the "jizya", literally a tax on alcohol, that some scholars have argued was a precursor of the modern Muslim tax). It would be interesting to know whether other aspects of this pattern of Muslim influence on European academic institutions, such as the extent to which there have been similar attempts at integration among monasteries, are also captured by historical documents (e.g., de la Vielle, 1992: 38).

What of the Islamic roots of the Enlightenment?

A recent study, by Stephen S. Stone and James M. Wood, has sought to shed some light on the Islamic origins of modern French intellectual history, particularly on the themes of intellectual progress and liberal democracy (see in particular Piazzi 2009; Stone 2008; Stone, 2009:
