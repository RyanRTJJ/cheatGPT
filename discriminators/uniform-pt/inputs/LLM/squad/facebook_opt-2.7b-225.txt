 core of the Seleucid Empire was heavily Greek-speaking, with many cities becoming centers of regional, and even worldwide Greek culture. During the late period of the Seleucid War (266–146 BC), the Seleucids suffered one of their most massive defeats in the hands of the Persians and the Hellenes. However, after that catastrophic defeat, the Seleucids managed to reorganise themselves and regain control of a new empire in southern Syria and eastern Mesopotamia. The Seleucids' second golden age, under the rule of Antiochus I Nicator (r. 269–231 BC), continued for much of the 1st and 2nd centuries BC. The empire flourished under the control of a new Roman emperors, who were mostly Greek, and by the later Middle Ages came the subject of Christian mysticism.

Most of the original Greek language of Byzantium remains intact. Greek was the national language of the Orthodox Christian Orthodox Churches. The first known document in the Greek language (known as the Gospel of Nicodemus of Cilicia, since that is where it was written) was written down in the 4th century by Constantine Porphyrogenitus, possibly in the western town of Byzantium (modern-day Istanbul). Greek became the national language of the Empire of the Two Sicilies. However, Greek was then supplanted rapidly by Latin as the international language of science, arts, and commerce. At the outbreak of the Balkan Wars in 1912, only 2.8 million Greek speakers remained in the Balkans. A few centuries later, there were fewer than 400,000. In recent decades, however Greek has regained in popularity. In 1975, Pope John Paul II proclaimed the Greek language a language of the Catholic Church.

Most surviving Greco-Persian heritage is that of Greece, and more often than not, that of the Hellenes in the Persian Empire, but there are plenty of artifacts that are also from Persia, which became the empire's first major competitor with Rome, and especially the Sassanid Empire, that have survived for centuries.
