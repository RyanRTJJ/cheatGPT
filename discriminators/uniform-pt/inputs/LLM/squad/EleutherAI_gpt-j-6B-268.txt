 and name across most of Europe. Historically, the meaning of the name is derived from the Latin (Poly/polytechiones, "many/many courses", Techō/tectī, "building material", hence "many/many built") and it has been used in all Romance languages and dialects (as opposed to the Latin-derived English word "university") (see list of polytechnics in European countries).

In the UK and Ireland, polytechnics and institutes of technology are known as technical universities, and are the main providers of technical education.

History
During the 19th century, technological developments and advances led to the creation of many distinct types of institutes of technology. Among these are:
 Arts and Crafts Schools - were designed to provide practical training for a limited number of artisans, in fields such as cabinet making.
 Institutes of Technology - these were in most cases technical colleges offering full-time and part-time courses in engineering. The term "Technology" was originally not used.
 Trade Schools - these schools provided trade-related vocational courses of a much more technical nature than the technical colleges and were more common in North America.

In England and Wales, the term Institute of Technology or Technikons was used for technical colleges and universities. In some of the newer universities, the term Technology has been used to describe the curricula to reflect the increased emphasis on science. In other cases, the term Technology has been used to describe technical courses and courses such as Engineering, Chemistry and Physics. However, the distinction between science, technology and engineering is now lost.

In Canada, Technological Programs were created in some universities by merging the technical skills departments with the existing arts and science departments.  The most significant example of this is McMaster University. (See Canadian Institutes of Technicians) However, in most of the provinces of Canada (Ontario being the exception), the Technological Programs eventually became full faculties (as McMaster did in the late 1980s).

In the Republic of Ireland, an Institute of Technology, or Technicon, is a type of college used to denote technical institutions which have university status. There are five Institutes of Technology in Ireland and two in Northern Ireland.
