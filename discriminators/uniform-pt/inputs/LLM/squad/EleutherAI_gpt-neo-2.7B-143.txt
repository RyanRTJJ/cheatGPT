 1970s flexible records are widely available and are used throughout all fields of entertainment. With these records there is no breakage and the quality generally is very high, as the records are "break-resistant".
As has been said, with respect to the records of the 78 rpm era, as the record becomes smaller, the playback system becomes weaker and weaker, that is, there are disadvantages involved. With the smaller record, the speed of rotation is less and still is not fast enough relative to the frequency of vibration to allow a fast response. That is, it is impossible to achieve a fast reaction with a small record or a small and weak system.
In the recent decade, flexible magnetic tapes have been extensively developed for use as an effective storage medium used in computers. These flexible magnetic tapes have the same disadvantages as above and cannot play back as fast as records of the 78 rpm era even under the best circumstances. On the other hand, flexible magnetic tapes record at an acceptable speed.
The problem to be solved is that a system must be provided in which a small and weak system can play back relatively fast without any breakage. If such a small and weak system is provided, the recording and playback speed of the small system can no longer be utilized as a means for saving money and recording time. The system can no longer be used to promote efficient information use.
On the other hand, with a small system, although the reproduction is rapid, if the system is made to play back sound or voice from a
