In September 1947, the Lithuanian SSR made the decision to withdraw all of its forces under Soviet direction from Klaipėda (Călui). The Estonian SSR, as part of General Secretary Nikita K. Khrushchev's drive to transform USSR into an anti-Soviet entity, and with Soviet assistance, was about to embark on the path of independence.

The USSR sought to help Yelena Koste, the People's Republic of Bulgaria's chief representative in Tallinn, Estonia, reestablish the Soviet-backed and, ultimately, independent state of Estonia.
