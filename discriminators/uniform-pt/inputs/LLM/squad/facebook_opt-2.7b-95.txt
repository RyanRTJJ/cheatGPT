 band Red House Painters.
I'm pretty sure Tim had an old-fashioned stringed acoustic mandolin when making the Red House Painters, and later some kind of cheap electric one for his solo work.
I think he played both (he was/is pretty prolific and recorded with a lot of different musicians), and I've seen his solo guitar sets (which have all been the traditional type) but I don't think he ever really used anything other than the double-strung thing.
That's good to know. I'm gonna have to go back and check out the RBP stuff.   I have an old electric mandolin that doesn't have a bridge and I use it for lead solo work a lot (also, I'm a dude with long hair who plays country music) and a lot of bands like Tim use these electric mandolins too, I wonder if they ever use actual mandolins at all.
Yeah I love it because it gives a lot of the ragged, raw country sort of sound. And Tim's playing is great. I really wish he was touring with Red House Painters more, it's a really cool sound but it's not a style of music he's really suited for. It's always a bit jarring when he just sits at his bass like a true country guy playing classic rock.
Yeah it's kind of a shame because he's a master of country-rock/folk rock stuff.
It does bother me that a lot of it is a bit formulaic though. There was so much that was special
