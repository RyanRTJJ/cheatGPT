 feeling like just a "burden." Daniel Day-Lewis' character, on the other hand, can't believe he could have been the one to make Elizabeth Swan his wife in Little Miss Sunshine. The most interesting of the children's fathers are those trying to be decent parents: the adults are terrible. In Little Miss Sunshine's "How to Train Your Dragon" sequel, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) goes to great lengths to raise his nephew (Josh Gad), as well as teach him how to hunt and how to talk to people like him. That's not as easy, however, as Hiccup tells his friend, "I'll never be a man," because he doesn't want to be the "caring parent" that the character has always wanted. As a viewer, I couldn't stand when the adult characters showed that it was possible to be a caring parent; it felt disingenuous and unnatural. How can I say "I'd never be dad" when I see children growing up who deserve dads, and are being denied them?
