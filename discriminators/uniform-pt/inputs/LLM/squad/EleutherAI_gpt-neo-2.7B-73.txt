Evolutionary psychology emphasizes the importance and influence of biology in human psychology.

This was the first major and wide-ranging approach to the study of human nature since the introduction of modern psychology by Sigmund Freud in 1919 and has remained the central theme in anthropology and psychology ever since, though it has since been subjected to criticism and criticism.[3] According to the critic Robin Dunbar, who has coined the term "neo-humanism", evolutionary psychology "is concerned solely with human-specific phenomena", not with "a critique of human behavior".[page needed]
