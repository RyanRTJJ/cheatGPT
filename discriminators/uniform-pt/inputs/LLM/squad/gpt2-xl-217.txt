 for example, is entirely made up of different flora from several other regions, while Antarctica and Antarctica are entirely made up of distinct environmental communities, from which different local fauna can be drawn. On the other hand, a wide variation in the abundance and distribution of different groups (which in the case of flora and fauna are entirely different) does not necessarily mean that their ecological niche is similar, since ecological niches tend to be defined by differences in their population of ecological competitors. When the environmental and population context is the fundamental variable, then ecological niches and populations can be compared and contrasted, as we are doing in the two examples of the ocean floor (see Chapter XIX). So we can see that some differences can only be explained by differences in environmental and population contexts. But what factors create different types of ecological niche, and which create environments which are similar to existing ones? A number of factors have been postulated, for example different environmental niches for living and migrating species (Chapter I), and habitat type (Chapter X), but none has received any widespread acceptance (see Chapter XII). A new idea has recently been advanced by Bork and Wegner in relation to differences in niche, and specifically the idea of species niche divergence (see Chapter XII). They postulate that ecological niches tend
