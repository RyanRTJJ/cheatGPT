 sufficient to make such a transition work in the near future — even if a successor was built around any of the two architectures.The Apple decision to bring the Mac into the newly introduced Intel architecture, however, was a major disappointment. As it is, it was largely at odds with the company's internal policy to allow its customers to have multiple devices in their home. The reason it was so difficult to bring such a device into a company's system was not because the new Mac could not support only a single processor — but because the new Mac was a single CPU. So instead of doing a transition with the computer and working with the Apple-manufactured chips on Apple's new Mac, the decision must have been based on Apple's own logic.The decision to have the Mac on an Intel-based system in the early '90s was a big disappointment to some of Apple's customers, many of whom would have been very unhappy to have a Macintosh. To counter Apple's pressure, Intel had begun to install Intel-based servers on their Macs in response to customers' demands. Intel itself took that decision seriously.Apple and many others have argued, too, that Intel's efforts to build out a Mac in recent years has failed, leaving many customers with little choice but to choose either an Apple based laptop or a Mac OS X system. It also was a big disappointment to many customers to learn that Intel was not building in a separate graphics card for each Mac they purchased, or to believe that those chips would be able to support the newly developed Mac — even if Intel had found many of their customers
