 attention was focused on securing a toehold on North America. The United States initially supported Britain in the war, though the government was concerned about the spread of slavery and wanted no more than a token American involvement in Europe, as part of the Triple Alliance. But when it became clear that the war was losing its purpose, American involvement would expand dramatically.

Congress authorized the initial occupation in early 1814. Two months later, in September, Congress reauthorized the funding and made it an annual obligation, a move that allowed the nation to spend more on military action without raising taxes.

The British were not deterred and moved to capture the Chesapeake and eastern sections of Maryland, but their efforts were limited in nature. As the war dragged on, the British and their French allies used the time to occupy and establish a military base in Louisiana.

The War of 1812—for the time, the United States' major conflict of the nineteenth century, and the only true war it was actually in—lasted through June 1815, with a successful final phase late in 1815 ending an alliance with Britain. Though Britain could keep hold of Canada, the balance of naval power remained in America's favor.

The United States assumed full and rightful responsibility for the area by claiming that New Orleans had declared itself an
