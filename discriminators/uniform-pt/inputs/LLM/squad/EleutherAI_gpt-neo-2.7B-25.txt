 development strategy, improving the national development, and creating new industries, and in a lot of sectors which are related to the development of electromechanical industries, such as automobiles, heavy machinery, shipbuilding, electronic industry, aviation, construction machinery, etc. are the key bases.

In 2002, the industry and the production value of the main sector in the Zhejiang Province was around 7.824 billion RMB (about US$1.9 billion). There is a general trend of increase in the industry and production value of electromechanical sectors of the Zhejiang Province. From 2002 to 2010 industry reached a value of about 18.3 billion RMB (about 1.18 billion US$ per year). In comparison, the industry and the production value in 2010 in Wenzhou and Shanghai were 7.6 billion RMB and 10.8 billion RMB respectively.

In 2002, the industry and the production value of electro mechanical was about 11.2 billion RMB (about 1.56 billion US$ per year) in Zhejiang Province, and the main reason is that the industry and the production value in Zhejiang Province has a higher tendency development. In the Zhejiang Province, the production value of automobiles, light, medium and heavy machinery, air transport and sea transport, engineering industry and so on are all of a higher value. From the industry and production value point of view, Zhejiang Province has a higher production value of engineering industry and its automobile industry is the lowest in the whole country. In addition, Zhejiang Province
