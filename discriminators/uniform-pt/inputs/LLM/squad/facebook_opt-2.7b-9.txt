,000 sq. ft) of living space. The building will comprise six separate sections. Four sections will provide living spaces for 25-28 residents; one section will house a spa and two other sections will provide sleeping accommodation for 18 residents. The complex will comprise three wings, of which one is under construction as we approach the holiday.

The eastern wing will sit on private land.

The western wing consists of two five storey sections. The eastern section will have five rooms ranging in size from 20 to 24 m2, and all are on the same floor. The western section, on the other hand, will have five rooms ranging in size from 24 to 28 m2. All rooms have private or semi-public entrance halls and private elevators. However, residents will have to cross through the private entrance hall to access the elevator on the ground floor. This is very unusual as most luxury hotels (and indeed most commercial buildings) use a single private entrance hall â€“ not a side entrance hall. The ground level will be an open courtyard with a pool and various garden elements. The eastern two stories will feature the main pool areas, as well as landscaping and a small lawned terrace. The western section will provide gardens on each floor as well as a terrace on the central level overlooking the water garden (if construction goes according to plan). The eastern terrace, which overlooks the pool, will also be landscaped with a water feature.
