, the quicker and more successful they are able to identify their individual self-concept. According to the video Identity Development: From Childhood to Adolescence, “environmental factors early in life, such as parents providing support, structure, and clear expectations, can help to shape and define a person’s identity as they enter into adolescence.” This means that if an adolescent is surrounded by positive influences, they are more likely to explore their identity and form a secure and positive self-concept.

For adolescents from low-income families, the environment can cause difficulties when it comes to developing a strong sense of identity. Examples include an atmosphere of violence within the family, drug use, poverty and a lack of guidance from parents. These factors can make it more difficult for many adolescents to express their individual identity and to feel confident in their decision-making. It can also affect the ability to develop meaningful relationships outside the family and to have access to mentors.

In order to support identity development in all adolescents, the environment can be improved through community-based programs, family counseling, and mentorship opportunities. Having access to resources, guidance, and support in discovering their individual identity can be profoundly beneficial for adolescents from all social backgrounds. By providing these resources and encouraging adolescents to explore their passions and express their identity, a sense of security and acceptance can be achieved.
