 to lack such flexibility. Neonate immunoglobulin antibodies are believed to act on the body to prevent antigen presentation such as a small rash. There is conflicting evidence. Many studies show that infants are not at increased risk for developing viral disease because they do not have a immunoglobulin load. As of 2002, more than 10 million infants had been vaccinated since the age of 8.5 million. If there are indications of increased susceptibility, it is also possible that infants are developing new immune system functions through immune responses based on antibody response rates. Although such studies are limited, one study on infants of 5 months to 16 years of age found that some infants had developed new immune responses in the weeks prior to age 16 years of age without a detectable association with risk of viral disease during the two years of enrollment. In one of these studies, infants were not found to have any detectable differences in body temperature between pre- and lactates. As of 2006, there are many studies of infants who are at increased risk for developing viral disease. Some of these are found to have been randomized in clinical trials. The risk is relatively insignificant compared to other immunoglobulins. It is still not clear why neonates who are immunostaining are at risk for infectious disease, but a new, smaller study of newborns is needed
