 only a 40% chance of passing the first year of university-level mathematics.

The study, which was carried out by Andreas Baader, a mathematics professor at Wollongong University in Australia, measured a total of 2,300 students from Gymnasium in two groups. One group was put into the comprehensive system and the other was subjected to the regular system.

Baader found that the proportion of students who failed their first-year mathematics tests in the regular system had jumped from 8.1% in 2010 to 20.1% last year.

He claims that this is in direct conflict with claims often made by critics that the comprehensives are giving Australia’s students a false sense of achievement.

“Overall, we find evidence of significant grade inflation within the regular School Curriculum, with students getting increasingly better grades across the board,” he writes.

“However, among students who performed poorly across the board, it may be worth asking whether it isn’t worth improving the overall quality of teaching in order to increase individual student achievement in mathematics.”

Baader is well known for his research on maths grading and has previously come under fire by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority over the method he uses to determine a student’s grade. He has denied claims he has invented new mathematical formulas for rating students on subjects.
