 compatible with its PC-based product line and decided to build a PC line on Intel's x86 architecture. Intel's new chips, which had already been adopted by some companies such as Sun Microsystems, had a small cache of 256KB instead of the usual 512KB, but Intel was happy to give Apple a new architecture to test. Apple had long been working on a new Power PC platform which could compete with Intel's best-selling and widely-used G3, but the project was postponed indefinitely.

In an effort to speed up development of the PowerPC architecture, Intel hired a small team of its hardware engineers to work with Apple's hardware engineers. Intel offered to license some of its new code to Apple for testing purposes. However, Apple refused. With no viable third party platform on the horizon, Intel began work on a 64-bit Intel-powerPC-compatible design. Apple was told, "Look at what we're doing. We're going to use all your technology."

In 1991, IBM, Motorola, Fujitsu, and NEC announced they were abandoning X86 and adopting PowerPC. Intel sued them and acquired Motorola, Fujitsu, and NEC for a relatively modest $150 million. Intel had been a major customer of a number of these companies, most notably Motorola and NEC. In December of 2002, Dell, which also had bought Motorola, announced the launch of an x86-based PC called the Intel Compaq Compaq Presario. Apple sued Intel, saying Motorola and NEC had stolen designs from Intel, and acquired Motorola in 2003 to protect its patents. Both companies lost the ensuing lawsuit.

As an alternative to working with IBM, Intel approached Silicon Graphics for help. Intel eventually hired Silicon Graphics for about $200 million. Intel then decided it could take on Apple again
