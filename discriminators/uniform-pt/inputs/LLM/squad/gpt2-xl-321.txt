 10 years.

It follows a series of deals for BT Sport - the UK's leading sports broadcast network - between 1992 and 2013, in which its current rights are worth £2.3 billion over six years, up 10 per cent from the previous year.

The network also sold an international rights deal to its parent company, Deutsche Telekom, worth £2 million a year before the 2010 agreement, and a lucrative deal to the US-based Fox Soccer TV to show two matches per season from the 2010-11 season before the deal expired.

All the previous Sky deals have been negotiated individually by Michael Owen, the chief executive of Sky, and agreed by his fellow senior executives.

Sky had hoped that its new rights deal would start from 2015, in time for the Rugby World Cup in England, and would represent a major milestone in the network's ambitions.

But Sky is already in negotiations with the global broadcasting giant NBCUniversal, which runs the US network USA Network, for the US rights to a number of other rugby games.
