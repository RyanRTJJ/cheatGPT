 transmitted infections (STIs), may prompt some to avoid sexual contact altogether, more adolescents are actively engaged in this kind of risky sexual activity. In the last few years, social media has been increasingly associated with various forms of adolescent sexual communication, including sexual networking, information exchange on apps or the web, as well as chat rooms and forums,[@bib1] which provide a valuable environment for the exchange of sexual experiences with strangers and those to be known.[@bib2] Although social networking sites were once mainly considered as a way to interact with friends and keep in touch,[@bib3] their uses have expanded dramatically.[@bib4]^,^[@bib5] Indeed, in a rapidly changing world, social media play an important role in many aspects of people\'s lives, including sexuality.[@bib6]^,^[@bib7] Despite their widespread use in today\'s society, it is noteworthy that few studies provide empirical data to explore the use of such technologies by young people.

Research highlights an increase in the use of social networking sites, in particular for sexual purposes (see Haldin et al[@bib8]). Indeed, a growing number of adolescents are now using online resources such as sexual networking sites as they seek sexual communication (see Haldin et al[@bib8]). According to a recent study, online activities involving communication about sexual matters doubled during 2009--2013 and were equally present on social network sites and chat rooms, and this proportion increased by 2-fold on gay websites between 2013 and 2018.[@bib9]

The present study explores the extent to which younger adolescents (ie, 11- to 13-year-old youths) have been drawn to online social networks of a sexual nature. It
