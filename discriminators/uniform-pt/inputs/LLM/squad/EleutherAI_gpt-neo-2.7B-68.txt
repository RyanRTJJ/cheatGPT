 to the Autobahn A1 in the west. During the 1950s, the remaining five motorways were built, in particular the E20 and E6, as a major link between the Land and the Ruhr. Their construction was based on the plan by Otto von Guericke, who advocated a network of motorways with a large number of connections, providing the most economical and fastest route, to and from the Ruhr. The main traffic arteries on the A4 through the Land were built in a way that kept the motorway as the primary road along the edge of the Land, while the Autobahn and Bundesstraßen (states' highways) connected via two large interchange stations. A key idea was to replace interchanges along the edge of the Land and allow traffic to flow at constant speed, a concept that would later be also applied to the ring roads (Runderführungskompletten) built around the Land.

Over the course of the 1980s, the first new motorway projects were planned in the Land, with the most high-profile being the A40 from Dübran to Bad Dübelstedt and the A10 from Bad Dübelstedt to the A52 motorway. These projects were partly inspired by the German construction boom, when there was little spare land and many people with money were building new homes. When the East German government in 1990 introduced the Einwanderungspolitik ("inward-looking policy", "migration policy"), it was clear that the new motorway projects would be financed by state support. In 1991, funding was provided for the A1 south-west and the A12 north-east of Frankfurt. This made the Rhenish motorway projects an important part of the
