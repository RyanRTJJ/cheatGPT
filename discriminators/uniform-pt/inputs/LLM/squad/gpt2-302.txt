 yards (50 m) high.

The home team plays on two days a week from December 31 through January 4.

That means the University of Calgary has plenty of time Saturday to start practicing Thursday. The Ducks' two-week home slate resumes Sunday (Oct. 24 vs. Arizona), when they host the Phoenix Coyotes and Ottawa Senators en route to their 2-1 home win over the Edmonton Oilers and 1-1 win over Edmonton. It also means Monday's Game 3 is at 7 pm ET and will air at 9 pm ET.

"Saturday will probably end up being this last week off, but we have the opportunity to get back to work on the schedule, give an extra bit of practice, and put a bit more pressure on ourselves before we go," head coach Bruce Boudreau said. "We have a few weeks of work ahead of us."

The season-opening road game against a top-heavy Vancouver Canucks team is also on Wednesday, with the game on Memorial Day weekend before the Canucks play Boston College at 3:30 pm (CST) and the home game against the Calgary Flames on Monday (10.30 am).

At 4 pm is the time for the Ducks to return to practice, after a two minute break prior to Thursday's game against the San Jose Sharks. The Ducks will continue to be at their regular practice on Friday but will not be heading to the rink Saturday for preseason games.

Both men's games will host Canada for the second straight week, following the game on March 16 (4 pm ET vs. Boston College). The Ducks will face the Hurricanes on April 2 to start the year-ending exhibition game on April 10 (8 pm ET vs. Montreal).

The three-game series, which is expected to be played at Rogers Arena, between the United States and Canada in August, will kick-start the season and give the Ducks more time
