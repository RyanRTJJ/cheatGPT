 normally located in a small room off the sanctuary, where an ordinary loaf of bread used for communion is placed during the communion ceremony (hence, "table," as bread is not used in the celebration of communion). The communion table is simply a table on which the bread and wine are placed for communion. In that context, it is considered common for ordinary loaf bread to be used during that service.

Baptisms are often held in a different location with or without "worshipers" present. Baptism is often a short ceremony that takes place in a bathroom, while the child has the benefit of water being sprinkled upon him by the minister. The minister will also often read the words of the baptismal covenant prior to the baptism. In the event that a baptismal covenant is not present, the minister's words will be used as written. The minister will often recite a "baptismal prayer," which is a prayer that is said in order to prepare a person for baptism and usually follows this pattern:

Our God whom we confess thou art;
Who hast prepared us for this day;
And given to us this day our bodies
For the healing of the world.

We therefore come to thee in peace
That thou art reconciled to us;
And to all mankind mercifully reconciled;
That our offences may be pardoned.

We acknowledge thee to be the Father of all mankind
Who hast created us by thy love;
And dost enable us to do thy will
Thy law
