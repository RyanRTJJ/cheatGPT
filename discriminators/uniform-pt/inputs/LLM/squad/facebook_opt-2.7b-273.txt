 at the sight of the gastric acid. The gastric acid is produced by the stomach in the stomach, and is converted into hydrogen ions that are absorbed to a pH of from about 5.8 to about 7.3. The gastric acid then is transported to the ileum, then to the small intestine and the colon, which finally absorbs the hydrogen ions to be destroyed by the small intestine or the colon to finally form the final product water as urine. The first phase is called the cephalic phase. The gastric phase is called the gastric phase and occurs when the acid that is absorbed in the stomach reaches the small intestines. The acid causes hydrolysis of proteins in the small intestine to ultimately formed proteins as amino acids. The first phase ends and the first phase begins by neutralization of the gastric acid with the acid of the bile. The acid of the bile is absorbed in the small intestines and then hydrolyzed to form protein, then amino acids, which is ultimately absorbed in the colon as protein. The cephalic phase is referred to as the “bile stage”, or the “proto-bile stage”.
The first phase is referred to as the cephalic phase. Because of the acids in the stomach, the enzymes produced from the pancreatic cells or from an organ transplant are hydrolysed in the stomach, and in particular, the lupulin proteases can be hydrolysed in the stomach. After hydrolysis, the amino acids
