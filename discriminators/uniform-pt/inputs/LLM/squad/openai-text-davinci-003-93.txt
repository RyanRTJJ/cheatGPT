Wanzhou railway at Zhijiang, Shitoucheng and Renhuai, respectively.

The Japanese 3rd Division, led by Lieutenant-General Kanaya Kōtarō, was composed of the 33rd infantry brigade, the 5th cavalry brigade, and the 3rd field artillery brigade. It targeted the cities of Huarong and Wuqiao, while the 6th Division commanded by Lieutenant-General Usami Yoshizumi targeted Renhuai and Wuchang.

Meanwhile, the 40th Division, led by Lieutenant-General Takeda Sumijirō, was assigned to capture Zhijiang, but met strong resistance from Chinese forces. Hoping to artillery support of the 4th Artillery Regiment, Takeda ordered a unit of his 40th Division to retake Renhuai, which had been captured by Usami's 6th Division. With increasing pressure from the Japanese forces, the Wuhan National Revolutionary Army was forced to retreat to Yichang.

The Japanese forces then continued to advance south and eventually seized the Yichang–Wanzhou railway. On October 22, 1938, the Japanese 3rd Division successfully occupied the eastern part of Hubei, leading to the Japanese occupation of Yichang and Wuhan later that month.

The Japanese 3rd, 6th, and 40th Divisions' campaign was a major step towards the Japanese conquest of mainland China. The victory also allowed the Japanese to gain control of the Yangtze River and its valuable shipping routes. The campaign also weakened Chinese resistance and allowed the Japanese to extend their influence in the region, paving the way for further military operations in the area.
