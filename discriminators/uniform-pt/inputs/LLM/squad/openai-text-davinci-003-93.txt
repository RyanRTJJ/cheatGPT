. This study used a data set of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA extracted from saliva samples of 895 mostly European Jews, 25 Turkic-speaking Kalmyks and 6 Uzbekis for comparison. The results generally agreed with Behar's overall conclusion, but differed significantly in that the maternal DNA of Ashkenazi Jews appeared to derive primarily from just four main female ancestors, termed the "founder lineages." Comparing each of the 895 samples to a reference set of 185 samples from various non-Jewish populations from the Middle East and the Caucasus found that in comparison, the Ashkenazi Jewish lineages were much more closely related to each other, and less closely related to their non-Jewish counterparts, than would be expected by chance.

The same study also concluded that the four founder lineages experienced a major population expansion dating back to between 1,600-2,000 years ago, in agreement with Behar's findings. Furthermore, the study noted that the four founder lineages seemed to be absent or extremely rare in non-Jewish populations, suggesting that much of the Ashkenazi Jewish population may have descended directly from those four women. This suggests that modern Ashkenazi Jews may be descended from a relatively small number of female ancestors, rather than from a broad and diverse population as previously believed.
