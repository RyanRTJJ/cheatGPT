 Wire", was released that month. The track debuted at number two on the Billboard Soul Singles chart, though the next week the single fell out of the chart. "Let You Down" began reentering the charts a few weeks later, debuting and peaking at number 10 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and number two on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. "Let You Down" made its debut on the U.S. R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart at number 17, which was at the time a career-high.

Despite reaching number two on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles in February 2004, "Let You Down" failed to match the same success as "Through the Wire" did on the same chart in January. The single failed to make an impact, and spent the following year in the bottom ten of several charts, with the accompanying music video making headlines for the rapper's appearance and for his controversial lyrics about marijuana.
