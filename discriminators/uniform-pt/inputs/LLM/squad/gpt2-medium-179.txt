 sufficient to cope with all the processing demands of the computer market. In addition, Intel was reluctant to invest in support and certification for OS/2 and for IBM's Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) processors because of what it viewed as IBM's growing influence over ARM's processors. IBM declined to invest in Linux during the early 1990s.

Apple is not the only computer vendor to refuse to invest in support and certification for Linux. Intel's PC-based Macs continue to receive an inadequate amount of support, and most Intel-based computers from this period are poorly built. The IBM PCs sold through the mid-1990s were often made in Asia and have been poorly tested.

Intel and Microsoft agreed to a three-year delay in support for Linux in 1996, as the U.S. software market began to rapidly expand beyond the PC to include the Internet, multimedia applications, personal computers, etc.

Linux was now widely deployed, with approximately 1 in 8 U.S. commercial computers based on Linux in 1996. By then, most IBM PC owners and more than 1 in 100 Microsoft PC owners also had computers with IBM-provided Windows licenses.

IBM sold about 40 million IBM PC computers between August 1996 and August 1999. As shown in Figure 2, in 1998 about 1 in 4 IBM PC owners and more than half the general-private sector PC owners did not have a Windows license. Because of IBM-specific agreements with the other major IT companies and as a result of IBM's strong market position IBM PC business fell from 50.7 percent of consumer PCs sold in 1998 to about 39.2 percent of consumer PCs sold in 1999.
