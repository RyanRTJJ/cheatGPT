ius had sent him to minister in Rome and other locales. Hosius was head of The Western (Latin) “Church” / “Catholic” Church and as such he also had the honor of being the official “Patriarch” of the city of Rome.

The Patrimony of the Roman Church had become a disputed matter as far I can remember; and I’ve forgotten many times from where Athanasius came into the picture. The Roman church claimed a direct inheritance from Peter and the other apostles, whereas the Greek church claimed their patrimony had originated from Peter’s mother’s side; which is why the Latin church “had” their patrimony there, and their bishop was the “Pope”.

Athanasius in 343 was there in place of Hosius; he was not even as Bishop at the time; rather he was the secretary to Hosius. Hosius had just died; and Athanasius, if you remember, was there ministering for two or three years.

Now the year 343 also happens to be the year when Constantine the Great, at the battle of Milvian bridge, had captured Rome, and in short, defeated and killed Maxentius, the Roman emperor. Constantine had converted to Christianity.

Athanasius, while in Rome, was appointed his (Constantine’s) secretary, as we can see here

But Constantine also gave to the Church there, and in the city, the name of Constantian after himself – rather than the name of the pagan god “Horus”, the one of the early Greek mystery mysteries.

There are stories and stories and stories about why and how Constantine turned to Christianity; some say he was baptised to be made a king (or emperor); yet I believe that Constantine was baptised, or converted to the Christian faith, sometime in 325AD. And certainly he died as a Christian. In fact, after his death, he was to be worshipped as a Christian deity in the various ancient Roman cities in Europe, as well as Alexandria (North Africa). Some say that he was baptised in “Cybele’s House”
