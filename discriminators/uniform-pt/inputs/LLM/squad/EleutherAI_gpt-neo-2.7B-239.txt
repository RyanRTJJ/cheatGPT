The first-known king of the Bai dynasty, Wu-zheng, built the site. His successors are believed to have been more agriculturists than political rulers.

Baihua's prosperity probably began after at least the fourth century BCE, when it expanded northward as it was connected by a series of irrigation canals to the Yellow River. Because of its location, it was relatively easy to control. In the fifth century BCE, a rival center of development, the Xi, appeared in a nearby valley. There is only one historical record of a battle between the Xi and Bai. In the words of the historian and mathematician Zhang Haidi: “After the battle, the Xi took the horses and oxen of the Bai and used them to help with his military.

With the help of these resources, the Xi conquered the Bai and established the Xi as the dominant power in the territory of Baihua.”1

Later the Xi established a more enduring kingdom. In the late fifth century BCE, their ruler Wang Xingze conquered the Bai and, in a conflict lasting three hundred years, reigned as the first emperor of the Xia dynasty. He built a great capital at Chang'an, the oldest of the great capital cities of China. Within a century or so, the Xia replaced the Xi as the dominant power in the region.

After the Xia dynasty, Baihua and the surrounding area suffered significant political upheaval. In the third and second centuries BCE, an empire based in the Yangzi Delta in modern Hubei had dominated the area. After they conquered the
