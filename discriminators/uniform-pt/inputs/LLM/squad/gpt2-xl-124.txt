Fireworks will take place on the Eiffel Tower, just north of the Place de la Bastille after the official opening of the event on the Bastille Day on April 15th.

It is hoped that the display on the Eiffel Tower will be the first of many, with firecrackers being fired on the Eiffel Tower during the next edition of the Bastille Day ceremony to mark the first anniversary of the Islamic terrorist attack in Nice. The Bastille Day celebration on July 14th will see an open-air concert held just across the street in Place Vendôme.
