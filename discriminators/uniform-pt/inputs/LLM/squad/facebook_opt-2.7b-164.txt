 inches. Sea-Tac currently has 3.9 inches of snow on the ground.

Thursday’s snow event will continue through Friday morning with the steadiest accumulation of snow in North Seattle, Bellevue, and Tacoma. The rest of the area will see snow flurries, freezing rain, and sleet before 2/1 – 2/2 inch of accumulation.

Snow will end before 10am Friday and the sky will clear, allowing for sunshine. Temperatures will top out in the lower 20’s – colder than where most were this morning. Highs are expected to climb to the mid 30’s on Friday.

A new storm will enter the picture on Saturday which will bring more snow. There is currently a slight chance of a half-inch of snow at sea level and up to 2 inches on higher ground across eastern King County, Snohomish County, and the North Cascades. We do not expect the snow to be mixed to snow, but will likely find isolated snow showers on Friday and Saturday. Rain and some melting will also be possible. As this storm moves in, Saturday will be mostly cloudy with highs in the upper 20’s and lower 30’s (above freezing).

This new storm system could arrive by Sunday. We will monitor it and provide updates throughout the weekend and next week.
