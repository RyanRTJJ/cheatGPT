 of the present state of the British Empire" (Powell, p. 8).

In his classic work The Rights of Man, John Stuart Mill was also in awe of Burke and his work. Burke "was not a poet of words, who saw the great and the hidden in their places: but in short, he was a man of the world as well as of thought, of sense, of moral sense" ("Burke's Moral Philosophy", Part II, p. 24-25). "To say that we have a charter to the pursuit of happiness must have been an utter impossibility; and the pursuit, however well meant, could have had of itself no other end, than to be the occasion of misery for all who engaged in it" (ibid, p. 25).

In a letter to John Stuart Mill, George Orwell summed up Burke's attitude towards the state and empire as follows:

"The State â€¦ is one of the few things in the world that is truly permanent: if by its existence we do not lose our freedom, if we do not lose our rights, it will have been a glorious adventure".

"Burke's central insight was that we would only be able to maintain the state, and be truly free, if we left the world as it is and came to terms with the past. He opposed the war and the Empire on the grounds that they would merely perpetuate the present" (ibid, p. 25). "Burke's vision was more optimistic than that of many of his contemporaries who saw a state merely as a vehicle for the promotion of order by brute force." (ibid, p. 12).

Burke was no saint either: he was sometimes accused of being a tyrant. His most vigorous critic was the French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau:

"There is no more bitter and unreasonable critic of [the current British Empire] than the Englishman, and no more miserable victim of his ignorance and intolerance than he; that is, Rousseau. Every year more and more the nation is deceived and enslaved by the same policy which has been at work for four hundred years, and he is only too happy, after having expended all his venom on the subject of the English Empire, to fall into the same fatal error
