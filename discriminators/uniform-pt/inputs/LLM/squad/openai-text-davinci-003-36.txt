rway A5, which connects the south and north of Germany. Both projects were triggered by the increased traffic in the 1920s which lead to heavily congested roads. Both of the motorways remain to be a significant part of the German transport system.

The construction of the A4 was started in 1932 and the total length of the route, from KÃ¶ln to Dresden was almost 600 km. On the other hand, the A5 was the first motorway from Heidelberg to Basel. It was completed by 1939 and by then, its length was over 700 km long.

Both motorways were important in connecting the major cities of Germany, allowing for rapid and efficient transportation and contributing to the growth in the German economy during the 1930s. The developments of the motorway system allowed for a growth in the popularity of car, lorry and bus transport.

The investment in motorways had a major impact on Germany, both in terms of the economy and culture. It stimulated development in the surrounding countryside, bringing jobs and customers to the small towns in its path. It also enabled German people to go on more trips and holidays, as distances became more manageable and route planning was made easier.
