Shelter and fishing

One of the most important resources in the island's economy is fishing, as well as its surrounding biodiversity. On average each fisherman spends approximately $1 million annually, and the island provides over $8 million in tourism revenue each year.

Fishing

The fishing fleet consists of at least seven large merchant ships, with a total complement of over 200 commercial fishing vessels - with some ships as small as 3-4 metres long. These merchant ships use all sorts of methods, and the best-known are the trawlers for which the island is famous.

The trawler fleet consists of around 5 million tonnes of fish each year, of which approximately 500,000 tonnes are exported. To ensure maximum efficiency, the fleet has been fitted with state-of-the-art equipment to catch large fish, including the double-hulled trawler, which weighs around 1,200 tonnes and can catch fish up to 250 kg (550 lb). The trawlers are operated by independent fishing captains, working under contract from the Ministry of Fisheries.

There are around 120 registered fishing vessels, of which 10-15 are trawlers,
