 to speak out against the gun violence plaguing Chicago and throughout the country. But when he made those comments, he said, he was speaking for Chicagoans in a city where most people couldn't afford a cellphone. Then came a string of failed arrests on gun charges dating back a decade. Finally at the age of 26, after another arrest, he was sent to a federal correctional facility in North Carolina.

"My father was a car salesman, and that was how I learned to drive," King says. He later got his license and got his start behind the wheel of a pickup truck. But King also struggled with a crack cocaine addiction. During his time at the prison, he wrote what would eventually become "The Message," a highly acclaimed 1996 album. It featured "The Letter" — spoken word about life's traumas and the evils of crack cocaine.

While many rappers have taken a stand on social issues in recent years — like 50 Cent (who criticized the 1999 murder of Rodney King), and Nas (who famously wore an "I Am a God" T-shirt to a 2007 concert)— few have found as much success as King has. In 2014, he was a featured artist on the Grammy Award-nominated "All of Me," released two years in a row. He went on to release three more albums in 2016 before announcing he would be retiring; in August, he released a statement saying he was going to put his music career on hold, but it turns out, his retirement wasn't the end game: In November, he announced his third album with production from Pharoahe Monch, "All of the Lights."
