 capital in Pharsalos, a city situated to the east of  Boeotia and the Gulf of Corinth, on the Ionian Sea. They, in turn, are regarded as being part of the Mycenaean civilisation, which was based on the mainland of mainland Greece. A significant aspect of Greek mythology is the relationship between the Achaeans and the Dorian peoples of Thessaly. The historical city of Thessalonica was first founded in 315 BC and the city became the capital of the new Thessalian Kingdom in 297 BC. Thessalonica fell to Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire in 189 BC, and was ruled from 190 to 168 BC by the Attalid dynasty. The Romans conquered Thessalonica in 168 BC, and later built a city named Beroea further upstream. The city became part of the Roman Empire early in history, and under the empire became the capital of the Diocese of Thessalonica. The city was attacked several times during the Roman-Persian Wars, notably during the 602 Battle of Panticapaeum, and remained under Roman rule until the 4th century CE, when it was conquered by the Eastern Roman Empire. Thessaloniki's population greatly increased during the Ottoman occupation, from 50,000 in the late 13th century, to 200,000 in the 19th century, and over 1 million by 1913.
