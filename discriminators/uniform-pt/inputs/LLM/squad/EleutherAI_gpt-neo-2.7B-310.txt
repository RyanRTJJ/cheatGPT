 the north and north-east, the Jura Mountains to the south-east of the Alps, and the Valais (Valais) to the south of the Alps. Within these areas, a number of distinct habitats exist, which are collectively referred to as Alpine ecoregions. This article attempts to provide a high-level overview of many Alpine ecoregions that are of special scientific interest when it comes to conservation of biodiversity. Furthermore, recent developments regarding the conservation of biodiversity related to tourism within Switzerland are presented. On the basis of its wide geographical extension and special habitats, the Swiss Alpine ecoregion is referred to as a "hot spot" for conservation. Although the protection of nature in Switzerland is in line with its cultural heritage, and is based on the principle that it is protected for all species that live here including indigenous species as well as all forms of life, this approach is not without shortcomings. Many protected areas are no longer considered viable. Also, it is essential to address the potential impacts of tourist activities on biological communities in all habitats through the involvement of stakeholders such as the tourism industry, and particularly hotels. Also, the tourism-related conservation of nature needs support from different government sectors. In this context, it is necessary to work alongside the tourism industry, but also with other stakeholders at national, regional, and local levels in Switzerland. Despite the fact that the contribution of tourism is growing and becoming more effective, it still has potential negative impacts on nature and has the potential to negatively affect other sustainable activities.
