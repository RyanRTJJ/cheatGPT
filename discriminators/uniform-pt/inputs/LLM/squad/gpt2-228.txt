 the majority built. In the early 1970s, the major urban transport authorities and the provincial authorities began work on the railway system. The current plans are to build more than 100 railway lines through Thuringia and the southern parts of the country. The Central Railway will help transport people, provide financial support for a wide range of industries and will also run local and state-of-the-art stations. The system will operate from two main tracks – the North-West track and the Southwestern track. Transport services will include the railways, a dedicated system of railway and railway line, the railway office in town and a central headquarters.

Railway is primarily composed of three main lines – the Central East and North-South Railroad, which will be operated in four different modes. The North-East railway, to which it will be operated in five different modes as well as the Transcendence line and the East-West line, will span all of Thuringia. The Transcendence railway will be operated through a central central depot and will run along a route of one kilometre connecting Thuringia with the city centre. The East-West and Transcendence railways operate separately and run separately in a different district to the capital. One of the main reasons for planning to transport people and to build new roads and train stations is that new road construction will inevitably be hampered.

Central government infrastructure and land use development is expected to contribute about 75 percent of new transport capacity over five years. For the railroads, this will be about 20 percent of total transport capacity at the end of the 2030s. With more than 75 percent more capacity to be added and some roads built, the overall capacity would increase to 80 percent. Central government
