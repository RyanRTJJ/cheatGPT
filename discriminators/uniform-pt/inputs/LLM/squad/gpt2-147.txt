 show off the different types of grogs, from hand-drawn, pottery to leather-bound grogs. On a typical carnival night, you can find a dozen grogs to wear, each adorned with a different colour and type that you could actually wear on a piece of cloth.

A medieval custom that's not a true medieval one – for good or ill

In medieval times, the most significant celebration of the Carnival was the baptism and feast of St Benedict XIV, which was held on the banks of the St George River during the Roman era and which also celebrated the return of the Holy Week. It was known in Catholic countries as a prelude to the Feast of St Joseph for the rest of humankind. Even during the 20th century, most Westerners have long forgotten the Catholic celebratory calendar and have been told to avoid dancing and playing carnival balls. Yet, despite our long history of being a tolerant time on the Mediterranean coast of Britain—more than five decades after the death of Christ—it's still a bit hard to believe that any of this is happening. Just don't think I'm going to sit around in front of a festival filled with people who will celebrate this.

It's really that simple.

In what is probably a truly appalling case of "the right of religious belief and freedom to practice their own religion" as Pope Benedict XIV puts it, that is exactly what happened to St Benedict IV, the most powerful Jesuit priest, and he is to be found dead in his room.

There is a little documentary series you can rent here which takes a look at the life and death of Benedict I, including his deathbed speech during his last rites. It's a classic, heartwarming time capsule that makes you want to cry but also makes you want to keep going through your day knowing that at least some of his own family and clergy are out helping to take his body apart. You can watch the first two clips below.
