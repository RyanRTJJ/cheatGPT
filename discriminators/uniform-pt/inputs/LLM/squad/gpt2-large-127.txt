 arithmetic developed; theology was also re-discovered by the Renaissance; the most important modern scientific discoveries were those of Kepler and Galileo. (As a whole, however, the "modern" phase of research and learning took place in the middle-ages.) It was the late 19th century that gave birth to the field of linguistics, later to give birth to the field of cognitive psychology. The 19th century was a great time for philosophy's progress: the major philosophical works of the period are Descartes, Locke, Kant, Hegel, Spinoza, and Heidegger. In the mid-20th century, however, it was interrupted by the Second World War. With the fall of the Third Reich, most of the old ideas of the classical German school of philosophy disappeared. The philosophical tradition was reconstituted largely by the American philosopher Alfred North Whitehead and several other British philosophers.

Philosophy was rediscovered by the post-war period with the birth of modern psychology, and so psychology as we now know it, and also a wide range of areas of study in psychology, sociology, political science, business, and economics, started to develop from the late 1950s through the 1970s. This was the time, again, that the post-war educational system developed the Common Curriculum, which now spans the entire public school curriculum, including the theory-driven sciences and non-theory-driven sciences. The United States became the first country to abolish private education. Schools outside the public educational system, such as private charter schools, became established as a new kind of public institution. The "New" (social science) school of thought developed in the universities as well, with its "scientific method," "classical research" and "rational inquiry" being central to philosophy's new development.
