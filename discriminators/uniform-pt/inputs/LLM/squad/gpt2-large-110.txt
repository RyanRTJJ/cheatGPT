 Scottish Parliament established the Scottish Parliament (and the Scottish King) as the ruling body for Scotland, without an unifying government or a King. Scotland would henceforth be a semi-colonial state.

The new system of government, in spite of its ambiguity as to the nature and legitimacy of the Crown, established in 1603, has proved to be a model for all subsequent national governments. All subsequent governments, until the recent British one, have adopted a system of elected, semi-representative parliaments to provide for the administration of various branches of government. Some of these governments follow the Scottish system of governments in Scotland - the Assembly, the Committee of Union, and the Council of Lords.

In order to maintain stability, some governments have used a "dual-system" of government. In the Scottish case, this is the Scottish Parliament as the ruling body of Scotland, and the Scottish King as head of government of England. As in the case of English monarchy, it is the Queen's representatives in parliament, either in the Parliament or the Lords, who are ultimately in charge of the affairs of the Crown.
