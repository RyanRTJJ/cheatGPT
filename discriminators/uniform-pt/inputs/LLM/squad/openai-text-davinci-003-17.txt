 northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana. The Jurassic climate was characterized by a significant drop in global temperatures, allowing for the wide spread of tropical and subtropical vegetation. By the end of the Jurassic, the landmass had been divided into a variety of continents.

The Jurassic Period is divided into three parts, namely the Early Jurassic, the Middle Jurassic, and the Late Jurassic. Each of these periods is marked by changes in the faunal and plant communities. The Jurassic saw an evolutionary radiation of new species in the realm of the dinosaurs and other terrestrial animals, such as the first mammals and large reptiles. In the seas, the Jurassic was also marked by evolutionary innovations, including the first modern sharks, shellfish, and ammonites. 

In the Late Jurassic, the beginning of the rift between Laurasia and Gondwana formed, which triggered the uplifting of the Tibetan Plateau. The warm and wet Jurassic climate provided favorable conditions for the evolution of the dinosaurs and other terrestrial animals, as well as for diverse plant life. As a result, this period is often referred to as "The Age of the Dinosaurs". This period also marked the first appearance of the earliest mammals, amphibians, dinosaurs, archosaurs, and crocodiles. 

The Jurassic Period produced some of the most iconic fossils, such as Stegosaurus, Allosaurus, Dimetrodon, and Archaeopteryx. This period was also noteworthy for its extensive deposition of
