There was certainly, however, a high degree of cooperation between the Greeks and their Persian and Anatolian neighbors. The cities of the Seleucid Empire, however, were not without the Greek elite in them. Many of the leading figures of the Greco-Etruscan civilization remained prominent figures over many generations. Even the Greek language (Sanskrit) is the language of these civilizations, however the importance of the Greek literacy was much like that of Latin in pre-Christian Europe or of Arabic or Hebrew in modern Muslim culture.
