 demonstrate rotation of a rotating magnetic field. The Arago rotation has remained a cornerstone of experimental magnetometry because its rotating magnetic field can be detected by a rotating electric field sensor.
In this context, the rotating magnetic field generated by a sensor coil generates a rotating electric field, and the electric field sensor senses the total electric field between the sensor and a fixed reference point. The sensor coil may be mounted freely on the sensor in space, or may be mounted in a fixed frame between the sensor and the reference point on land or water. In this context, the magnetic field from the sensor coil does not contribute to the sensor signal, which is generated directly by the electric field sensor. Rather, any electric field contribution caused by the sensor coil arises just from the electric dipoles of current in the sensor coil due to the magnetic field of the rotating magnetic field.
For a rotating electric field sensor, i.e., an electric field sensor that senses an electric field between a fixed reference point and a sensor frame on a rotating object such as a rotating sensor coil, the magnetic field of the sensor coil can be shielded by the fixed reference point or by the housing of the sensor, or by both these elements, to protect the magnetic field of the rotating electric field sensor from interfering with the rotation of its fixed reference point or by the sensor frame.
In addition, the rotating electric field system or sensor can include the electric field detector for the total electric field (total electric field). The rotating electric field system or sensor may also include the electric field sensor for the relative rotation between the fixed reference point and the sensor frame, and electric field detectors for the relative rotation between the sensor frame and a mobile sensor frame, but the fixed reference point remains a fixed reference point for both quantities.
The electric field detection in the rotating electric field system or sensor usually consists of providing the electric field from the rotating electric field sensor with a first signal that represents a signal with a sinusoidal component in the frequency range of the fixed reference point in the rotating electric field system or sensor, and with a second signal that represents a signal with a sinusoidal component in the frequency range of the frame in the rotating electric field system or sensor, and extracting an oscillating phase difference
