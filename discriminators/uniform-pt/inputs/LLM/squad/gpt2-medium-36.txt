 it above 10,000 feet.

Airbus also wants to upgrade a second engine after the A380 was delivered to Boeing in 2001, so it can go faster than the A380, and reduce maintenance costs. The engine is not part of the A380, but is still being tested and it's likely the unit will get enough improvements for eventual service.

And then there's the possibility of using the plane to take astronauts into orbit.

After the F/A-18 made its first spacewalk in 2001, it made its final touch on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center on January 7, 2014.

That's when President Obama signed a bill into law granting NASA the NASA Exploration Resupply Vehicle, or NASA XS-1. The space agency will be using the new vehicle until sometime in 2023, when it's scheduled to be retired.

NASA says the XS-1 will cost less than a Boeing 737, give astronauts from various nations more reliable food and water sources and have improved flight conditions.

A 747-8 can take up to six people, making a larger mission more practical.

And while not every aspect of the new mission was done at Kennedy, it's still encouraging to have all this work done at the center, which has an annual lease price tag of $19 billion, including construction jobs on its base and equipment lease revenue.

That's about $350 million at today's rates.

A large chunk of that comes from maintenance of one of the world's biggest airports, the one built in 1976 for the International City/Expo Hotel and later for downtown Atlanta.

An earlier attempt to replace the two planes involved using one of two existing Boeing 747s, and this one used a later model model, as the
