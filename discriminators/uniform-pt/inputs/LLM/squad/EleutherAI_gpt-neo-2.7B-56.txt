 predominate, but the pattern is variable: in Israel, the Jewish inhabitants are almost entirely of paternal lineage, and in the Caucasus and the Balkans, where Jewish populations were smaller in numbers, the paternal component was also large. The female line was also important in the Middle East, as was shown by studies on Y-DNA variants in some of the Israeli groups whose ancestors originated in the region (see fig. 11-26).

Although the male line is dominant in most European Jewish groups, a few (notably the Yemenites in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, the Druze in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq, and the Palestinians of Galilee and Palestine) also contain a significant female component. This is likely to be due to the fact that the female line was also important in other populations that left their original homeland. This is the explanation that has been offered for the high frequency of women in European groups that originated in northwestern Europe (and in the Germanic groups), such as the Finns. It also applies to the Germanic peoples (as demonstrated by the great amount of Finn and Estonian Y-DNA shared by Germanic groups). The proportion of female lineages clearly varies in the Germanic peoples. The Swedish and Danish populations have high proportions of female lineages as a whole, but not in specific groups or regions.
