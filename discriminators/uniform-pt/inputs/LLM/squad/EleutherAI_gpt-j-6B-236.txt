 continued to be used on radio at all times, including the early 1940s, with the main purpose being the broadcasting of radio programs. The earliest known recorded use of the term, by Groucho Marx (b. 1890), occurred in 1941. (The term "ARC" was used on radio very infrequently during the next decades, as opposed to the popular slang usage of the 1930s.)

In 1962, a Columbia/ARC advertisement appeared in the January 8, 1962, issue of Billboard Magazine, announcing "THE GREATEST MUSIC OF YOU" (a slogan which was later revived, unsuccessfully, by RCA Records in the 1970s.)

The company's first "ARC" discs were a series of 78 RPM recordings (on 45RPM records) of the big band music of the first part of the 1930"s. Among the "ARC" artists were Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Lionel Hampton and Benny Goodman, among others.

ARC was the original supplier of records of famous artists and groups on the original "Artists Record" or "Artist's Record" label (the earlier "Artists and Their Recordings" series, which included recordings by the big band jazz artists, had been created by another company earlier) from 1948 to 1955. The "ARC" sound of the music of those years came from playing it on a very large, "open" style record player. During the middle of the 1950s, this sound began to change to an "all-glass " type record player.
