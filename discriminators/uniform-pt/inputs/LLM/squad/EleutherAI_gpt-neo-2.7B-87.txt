As of 2009, racial quotas are not legally-binding.  Most nations currently follow one of two strategies for implementing race-based affirmative action policies.  The United States follows the most conservative approach: race-neutral quotas. While this has been criticized as paternalistic, the US Supreme Court has found that when quotas are used, they are generally accepted.  The other method is the use of race-based goals that explicitly aim at remedying historical inequities.  This approach is not commonly used in the United States, but this approach is gaining popularity in Europe, Australia, and Canada.  Although race-based quotas as a means of correcting inequities are controversial, there has been no systematic attempt to prove that they are without potential negative effects.  In general, critics have countered by pointing to multiple studies demonstrating that race-blind systems of affirmative action benefit society by providing racial minorities with greater access and representation.  In the US, the American Bar Association has stated that race-neutral quotas do not provide a remedy for the harmful effect they may have on minority communities.
