 a climate change plan.


The Australian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a group run by Dr. Daniel Murphy, has conducted research in the US, UK, Ireland and Indonesia, among other nations, that finds the world has warmed by 2.2C hotter than the previously accepted 2.5C warming, based on the International Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).


The IPCC is a body that reviews, determines, and publishes the international climate models in order to assess the impacts of human activity and greenhouse gas emissions for different environmental, economic, and health concerns. It makes recommendations in regard to the human activity, greenhouse gas emissions and natural causes.


In 2014, Australia, based on its climate change targets, agreed to pay any additional funding to the Australian Capital Territory (ABCZ) to prevent its emissions from exceeding 3C. This will have an impact on population growth and jobs in the capital, says Dr Murphy.


"One of the things that makes Queensland very different from others in Australia is the proximity to a major state in Queensland," says Murphy. "These big coal-based communities are big, dense and heavily populated. But that is because of the nature that they have in terms of pollution and other problems that have arisen throughout Queensland, so the fact that they have a high density of people is why they have a need."


Professor Murphy notes that Australia's emissions from coal production came less than one third of Queensland's previous commitments to meet the state's emissions targets, but that this reduction, which should be expected, was much more than a cut in electricity prices on power plants.
