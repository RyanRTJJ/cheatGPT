Fiction

Archie Comics

In Young Justice Volume 2 #10, the Silver Samurai was first seen during an interlude in which the heroes were learning to take on the villainous Anti-Monitor. He was seen again during the final battle, at the climax of the story, but he only fought one time, being killed by a super-powered individual.

In another story arc, the Silver Samurai appeared later on in a flashback to the final battle against the Anti-Monitor, where he had taken an injured Batman under his wing and was about to fight him. However, after the superheroes defeated the Anti-Monitor, the Silver Samurai left the heroes when it was realized that no one else would be able to fight against the Anti-Monitor.
