, they begin to seek social support from others ([@b6-ijph-42-79]). An adolescent with low self-esteem may face difficulties in finding a social arena in which s/he can easily associate ([@b1-ijph-42-79], [@b4-ijph-42-79]). In a society that emphasizes individuality and independence, an adolescent's need for social integration is much greater than in a society that emphasizes community and cooperation ([@b7-ijph-42-79]).
