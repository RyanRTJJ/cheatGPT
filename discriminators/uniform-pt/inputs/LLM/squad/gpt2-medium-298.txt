ashes a cup of wine. The question is, if such an asymmetry is natural, why does it not happen for God?


A rationalist is aware of two problems with the theory of a dual being, firstly its "paradoxical dependence" on the notion of a God. This means that if we believe in a supernatural God, its existence is logically impossible. So we can't conclude that because a person believes in the existence of God that he or she is somehow morally obligated to believe in the existence of Jesus. But by this reasoning the person doesn't really have to believe in any of the miracles because the natural laws of logic give us to know that Jesus is already God.


Secondly, if we believe in a supernatural God, then it follows that he is not a perfect being. I could claim that there is something flawed in my own nature (the person I am rather than the thing I think or feel), the existence of which we cannot know (although we cannot deny in our brains). But this problem is even greater if we believe (in the logic of the theory of causation) that my desire to love God is somehow morally impermissible. If so, I can't see how it does not follow that my desire to love Jesus (or that I like someone, for that matter) is just as sinful as my desire to hate someone
