 large amounts of water would be necessary for good hydration without a deficiency was challenged by an editorial published in the American Journal of Public Health (1871). This was a rebuttal to the findings of French researchers who reported that persons in the poorest communities needed approximately 14 glasses of water daily from drinking fountains, public places and domestic water supplies. This is approximately 4 times above the minimum recommended amount for maintenance of good health, and approximately 8 times beyond the minimum recommended amount for hydration (6–8 tablespoons of fluid daily). Thus, this volume of water required for daily hydration was higher than the minimum recommended recommendations or the recommendation for maintaining good health. While some data do support such high drinking water requirements in the poor, a more accurate assessment is necessary to determine the health consequences of excessive hydration.

Recent research in nutritional disorders has shown that excessive hydration from drinking excessive amounts of water may increase the risk of metabolic complications and lead to other health problems such as osteoporosis, hypertension and diabetes. In a 2010 article from the New England Journal of Medicine (1) a group of international experts determined that the optimal threshold for water consumption for promoting optimal body water parameters was 0.6–1.5 g/kg body weight. This study suggests that an individual's ideal water intake may vary between individuals who consume more water than recommended due to health concerns.

In order to assess the health impacts from excessive hydration, this review will examine the literature of excess water intakes to estimate the potential health consequences of consuming excessive amounts of water. The primary goal of this review will be to determine whether excess amounts of water are associated
