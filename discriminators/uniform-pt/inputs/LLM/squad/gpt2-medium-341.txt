 used for feeding. Most of the jaws would have been eroded away via erosion, and fossils only serve to identify species. It is not known if some groups, like the Amorgena from central India, had more jaws in their jaw complex than others.

The remains of a group of theropods, like Archaeopteryx (Pholcus) or Protoceratops (Cyclops) and Triostei (Cygnus et al. 2005), are mostly polychaete. Theropods were smaller animals, often found at shallow marine deposits, and were known throughout the Paleozoic Era, when they were likely a part of the same group. Most of the remains are from the middle Cretaceous period, but a large number of early Cretaceous fragments of a type of marine sand-dune in China were possibly from earlier Cretaceous marine polychaetes, perhaps a late Triostei. This has been disputed (Liang and Liao 2004; Pescinato and Mazzone 2006; Yap et al. 2007). Polychaetes in the Early Cretaceous were generally thought to have evolved later than theropods.

Hippomidae

Hippomidae are among the most widespread families of dinosaurs, with some 150 species (theropods included) having been described from the Cretaceous until the present (Bohne and Houghton 1997).

Mollusks are members of the class Halichoidea (see below). These have very few fossils from the Cretaceous and most of the rest from earlier times.

Some of the largest, most famous crustaceans and other animals on Earth are dinosaur and feathered dinosaurs. In the Cretaceous, at least 80 animals and about 30 species of birds were alligators (e.g., Megalosuchus) with an average density of 1â€“2 kg. During the Miocene period between 65 and 30 million years ago, there were many others at the same level, including a type of arachnids with an average density
