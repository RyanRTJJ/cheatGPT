 had been with the club since 1995 and was a key part of the team which had won the club's first European Cup title two years earlier. His departure to bitter rivals Real Madrid in July 2000, for a then world record fee of â‚¬60 million, sent shockwaves through the club and their fans.

Figo's exit represented the beginning of a period of decline for the club. Barcelona had to wait three more years before they regained the La Liga title, and in 2002, the club was forced to sell star players such as Patrick Kluivert and Marc Overmars in order to balance their books. The club struggled for the next few seasons and were in danger of relegation in 2007. This decline came to a stop in 2008, however, as the club won its third Champions League under the leadership of manager Pep Guardiola and went on to win three consecutive La Liga titles.

The return of former players such as Luis Enrique and Carles Puyol, coupled with the emergence of superstars such as Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta, has brought Barcelona back to the top of European football. The tenure of Guardiola, who led the team to unprecedented success in 2009-10, has established Barcelona as one of the most successful and feared teams in the world.
