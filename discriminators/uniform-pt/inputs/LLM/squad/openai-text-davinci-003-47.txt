 enemies, the Drevlian tribe, revolted against him and his allies. In 977, he returned to Novgorod with the help of the Varangian Guards, his soldiers from Scandinavia who served as an elite bodyguard. He began to rule over Novgorod as prince and eventually became Grand Prince of Kiev, becoming the ruler of all Kievan Rus, an area that stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea.

Vladimir's reign was marked by a series of successful campaigns against neighboring tribes and countries, including the Poles, Lithuanians, and the Byzantine Empire, which helped to expand his territory and consolidate his power. He also established trade and diplomatic relations with other countries and implemented reforms that strengthened the state and its economy. Vladimir converted the Kievan Rus to Christianity in 988 and was later declared a saint by the Russian Orthodox church. His legacy includes the introduction of Orthodox culture and Orthodox Christianity to the Kievan Rus, which helped to shape the culture of modern Russia.
