 thrown in for a foul or when there has been a corner. In order to prevent confusion, the clock stops if there is a goal scored in the first half [when the ball is kicked, for instance] or at half-time [when the half-time interval has started]. If there is a goal scored in the second half, the clock is reset [as the half does not resume].

The player with the ball at a goal scoring position is known as the "goal-man/goal-woman" and he/she or both plays for one of the teams ("Home Team" vs "Away Team"). If one team wins, the goal-man/goal-woman is awarded a yellow or red card.

The goal-man/goal-woman starts by kicking out the ball from the goal-line, where it is then played back to the referee. The referee signals his approval or disapproval of the ball passing the goal-line before a decision has been made, by blowing a whistle. After a decision has been made [whether to grant a "Handball" foul or not], the ball is kicked out of the goal and the referee decides on the penalty.

The referee may ask the goal-man/goal-woman to play the ball back to the player next to him/her and then ask him/her to play the ball to the goal-line.

The home team may elect to play the ball across the goal-line, from the goal-line, or from anywhere within one metre of the goal area. However, the match-winner will be given a penalty if he/she does not play it back across the goal-line and the away team
