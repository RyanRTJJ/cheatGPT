 ago by the ancient Greeks and Egyptians.
Hippocratic and other ancient Greek and Egyptian doctors also described, in the Hippocratic Corpus, combinations of plant extracts, which were used to treat a variety of infections including malaria, and also in the treatment of other illnesses such as diabetes and obesity [see: R. Baur and E. Bauer, “Drugs and the ancient medicine,” in The American heritage dictionary of infectious disease (J. M. Barry, ed.) New York: Taylor & Frances (1995), vol. I, p. 1813.]
By the middle of the 20th century, several synthetic antimicrobials had been approved for use in humans. These antimicrobials included the penicillins, which are now important treatments for a variety of bacterial infections. The cephalosporins and the quinolones, which are generally less active than the penicillins, were later developed and have proven to be effective in a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. See: G. R. Kahl, “Structure and function in antimicrobial drug research,” N. Engl. J. Med., 332, p. 1465-1469 (1995); and, K. T. Houghton, “Antimicrobial agents,” U.S. PTO 580125 (1991). Since the latter half of the 20th century, several new classes of synthetic antimicrobials have been added to the armamentarium of healthcare practitioners, particularly for treating gram-negative and anaerobic infections, such as multi-drug resistant enteric infections, and for the treatment of urinary tract infections. Most recently, the fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, glycopeptides, and
