 whilst the plumage of a bird moulted after the breeding season is referred to in ornithological parlance as the "breeding" plumage; the breeding plumage differs between various species and, in some species, has a seasonal cycle which repeats itself throughout the year (see below). Many species also change their plumage as they mature.

In some birds the basic colour of the non-breeding plumage is usually sooty black, while in others it is coloured to match the ground colour or have a conspicuous pattern, such as bright green or stripes. Plumage is often acquired before the bird reaches maturity. In some bird species some individuals may adopt non-breeding plumage before reaching maturity, which results in adults with a range of plumage, some duller and browner than usual, others brighter and glossier.

Breeders moult their plumage before beginning to breed, and after successful hatching they change (moult) into breeding plumage. These are the same colour as breeding plumage for the species; for example, in the European Starling, the male adopts the breeding plumage after the female is in oestrus, and vice versa. For a male bird moulting after the female has commenced laying the first eggs, if a second clutch is required, it takes the female 2â€“3 weeks to recover for another attempt.

In some birds the appearance, age, and behaviour of individual bird may differ from "average" for a species, and hence it is important to be aware of how individuals normally look and act during the breeding season. Birds that have distinctive plumage, or whose appearance or actions have unusual meaning, also have "specialised" plumage. Some species with specialised plumage
