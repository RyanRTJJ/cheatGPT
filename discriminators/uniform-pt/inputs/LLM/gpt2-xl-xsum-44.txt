 a number of sponsors supporting the initiative.

The torch will then be launched in Dorset before arriving in London following a visit to the British Embassy, according to a BMW press release.

The torch relay has been in operation since 1948 and was first celebrated at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Munich, where a group of athletes carried the torch across the city.

However, this year's torch relay is the first to take a more leisurely route through many of Britain's towns and cities. In addition to Dorset, the teams will travel through Gloucester, Hertfordshire, Essex, Norfolk, Devon, London, Birmingham, Luton, Portsmouth, Manchester, Plymouth, Gloucestershire, Lincolnshire, Lincoln and Yorkshire.

Bike enthusiasts have flocked to the relay to join the torchbearer, who will set off at 6am on the day of the Olympics final. The 30-second torch relay will run every 30 minutes on the 25th and the 26th of July.

Bike enthusiasts are encouraged to sign up on the relay's Facebook page and to get involved with the "Bike To Olympics" project as it runs ahead of the torch relay.

Mr Gove is also working with the British Cycling Federation and the National Policing Improvement Agency on a project to have cycle routes painted on the side of buses across Greater Manchester.

The idea was first mooted in a bid to encourage cycling by encouraging people to cycle to events. Mr Gove has also taken a number of cycling initiatives onto the London Underground, with a cycle hatch in the concourse for cyclists.

He is expected to discuss the torch's torch relay with US president Barack Obama and Chancellor George Osborne in London on Tuesday, during a meeting of G8 nations held before the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.

Mr Gove has also set himself the challenge of creating 50,000 new jobs in cycling and walking over the next five years.

He has said he hopes that the torch will bring people closer
