 weeks in July 2013 after he claimed she had died as result of an accidental overdose.

He also claimed that "her heart had stopped and had not been resuscitated".

Judge David Eady told Khan: "Mrs. Atkin was a remarkable woman who was very much loved by you. And it was an enormous shock, it was an immense tragedy, to lose her.

"That's what led to your guilty pleas to two counts of perverting the course of justice."

A jury at Nottingham Crown Court heard that the nurse had taken part in a three-week course in London to study and work with HIV/Aids patients.

On arrival at Autumn Grange she was told she was expected to care for a pregnant couple.

She was forced to undertake her shift after her supervisor asked: "Will you tell your partner she's off today? Don't worry she'll be back by 11."

Mr Khan said she would later admit that she had lied claiming that she had not told her husband about the case and added: "She admitted lying to her husband in order to get more hours."

Mr Eady said: "You failed to report her absence to the authorities.

"Had you done so, you would have found out that your patient had left just hours before you were due to start work. You would have been aware of the risk to your health.

"Because you failed to report the patient's absence you also failed to inform yourself so that you could have warned your patients about the potential dangers of long hours."

He dismissed Khan's defence that the nurse had taken the first two weeks off to recover from an illness.

"She didn't take any time off at all," said Judge Eady. "She didn't feel she had to and she wasn't sick. That simply is not acceptable."

He sentenced Mr Khan to three years in prison to run concurrently and ordered him to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.
