Tiny Girl

Wendy's a cute and tiny girl.

She likes to swim and hug her toys and say "Awwwww".

When she gets hungry.

She wants a snack, she doesn't get it often.

The only thing she really loves is her "Big Bag" which is a giant bag of Cheetos.

So, when Wendy gets hungry, she grabs it. She throws it at someone,

who just happens to be an old lady.

The old woman jumps up angrily and Wendy is scared

for her life.

Then she screams "Help! Please, help me!"

And the old woman just walks away.

You know something's wrong when, in order to get the snack,

they had to chase her. Who knows! I didn't think of that.

Wendy's a little older than normal.

Wendy has a big tummy. If it stays full, Wendy will grow to be about the same size

as a normal person. Wendy's name was inspired by a very special girl

from my past, who was the first friend I ever made!

She was so tiny. So I made her smaller.

Hugs are very important to Wendy!
