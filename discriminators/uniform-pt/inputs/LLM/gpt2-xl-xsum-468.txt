: 'People will be able to go in a virtual city and interact with other visitors. There are virtual tours that exist in the museum and visitors will also be able to do their own virtual tours.'

The virtual tour will let visitors of all ages experience the beauty of the museum and its surroundings.

'One way you can take advantage of it is by visiting the works of the Museum of Modern Art in New York,' said Ms Ireson.


'There is a virtual tour. For example, some of the artists have created a virtual tour where they show people around the city. You can get ideas of the city's history.'

The Tate Modern's new exhibition takes visitors deeper into the world of a work by an artist like Banksy. The show is a major part of its Modernism series and is aimed at encouraging visitors beyond the walls of the building.


Visitors can choose from nine different virtual tours that allow them to walk around the Tate Modern as an ordinary person or visit certain pieces by the artist.


Visitors can find their way around the Tate Modern's galleries like a normal visitor and then use the tours in order to experience different pieces of work

Roland Barthes, one of Banksy's admirers, first saw the work at the now-defunct gallery Oryx and Crake, in London, during one of his regular visits with friends in the 1990s.


On its opening day, he recalled, the exhibition was sold out and hundreds of people queued outside for hours
