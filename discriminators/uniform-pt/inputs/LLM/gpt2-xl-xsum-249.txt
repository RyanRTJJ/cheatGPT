Sporadic clashes have killed nearly 200 people in the Gaza Strip since President Hosni Mubarak ended his two-year tenure on Friday.

Gaza health officials said that 13 children had died in the fighting. Several Palestinian militants were killed.

Hamas said it had captured an Israeli soldier in the fighting but the Israeli army denied there were any capture.

The IDF also said that six Palestinians were killed by an air strike near Gaza City on Sunday where it is operating an air-and-ship blockade of Gaza.

Rockets

Also during Sunday's war, Israel hit 55 targets in Gaza using "live tactical and strategic missiles launched from air, land and sea, including short-range missiles", according to a military statement.

Eight of the targets were located on rocket launching platforms, an army spokeswoman said, and more than 50 rockets were shot down by the Iron Dome defence system.

A total of 11 rockets, including at least one Grad rocket, were intercepted. Three people were lightly injured, she said.

Some 25 rockets, including anti-tank projectiles, landed in southern Israel.

Elsewhere, at least 24 Palestinians were killed during a strike on a house in Khan Younis, an area in southern Gaza, medics said.

Israel says that while it does not agree with all of Hamas' policies it will not tolerate rocket fire from Gaza into Israeli territory.

The army said troops were now carrying out operations in Gaza to destroy tunnels used by Hamas for smuggling purposes. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said the movement had lost the last tunnels between Gaza and Egypt when Egypt tightened its border with Gaza
