 online university of creative media now: Oxford course. The course, due to open in 2018, will focus on online and traditional media and the way we engage with content. It will draw on the best MOOCs from the Oxford offering as a starting point.

We expect to offer several live streams online and a set of classes to take the whole semester. Classes will be online as short as two hours for students to complete. We'll be doing them as we learn, on whatever platforms and devices are available: online lecture notes, screencasts, podcast, streaming video, and so on. We have a good idea of what kinds of subjects we want to cover, but we are always open to feedback.

Our first MOOC is titled The First Three Thousand Years. It will explore how to read a wide range of the best written sources for learning about ancient cultures. We have a very early lead for that, some ideas and outlines of chapters, but we still need the funding to launch it. If we hit our goal for The First Three Thousand Years by the end of April, we will see what we have been able to accomplish in a very short period of time.

We've known that the MOOCs were coming for a long time and, in many ways, it has not been too bad. However, some of the biggest challenges have been dealing with online students and, particularly, that we sometimes need to find ways of funding some of these efforts. However, we are taking a different approach this time. Not only do we believe that MOOCs have enormous possibilities for education (we're working on one ourselves, one of the most promising and exciting topics is that of artificial intelligence); but we want to offer free courses to be available to as many students as possible, all around the world. We believe in open access to the world's knowledge â€“ as it provides access to information that otherwise would be inaccessible. If anyone can learn anything from online learning platforms, it's absolutely everyone.

If you've enjoyed our work, please help us to make sure that others can.
