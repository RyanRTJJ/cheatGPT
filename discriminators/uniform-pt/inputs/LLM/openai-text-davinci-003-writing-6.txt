Theodore was an odd kid, who had perfected the ability to walk, run, and dance, sideways. He had discovered this ability after taking one step back, and being sent one year back in time. It was a frightening experience, but it was one he wasn't about to forget. After that night, he began walking, running, and dancing sideways to avoid any future trips through time.

It wasn't easy though, his parents were constantly trying to rid him of the “bad habit.” They would yell, scold, and punish him for doing it. Despite all their warnings, Teddy wasn't about to stop. He found comfort in the ability to control where he would go should he take a step back or forward.

One day, Teddy was walking to school when he stumbled upon a mysterious old man. The man nodded at Teddy, then told him that he was the one who had sent him back in time all those years ago. The man explained that long ago, he had been a time traveler and stumbled upon Teddy on one of his travels.

He had seen the fear in Teddy’s eyes after taking that step, and knew that he shouldn't have stepped back. Without intending to, the old man had sent Teddy nine years back in time with just one step.

The man told Teddy that he shouldn't have been punished for something he had no control over. He explained that walking, running, and dancing sideways was his way of controlling his trips through time.

The old man shared that he had once been able to do the same thing. He said it was a skill few had, and one that should be treasured.

Teddy thanked the old man for his advice and wisdom.
