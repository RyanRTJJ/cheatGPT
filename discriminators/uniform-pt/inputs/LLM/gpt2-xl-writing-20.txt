Brock Lane was visiting his mother in Pasco on Friday when three unknown men tried to rob him as he walked down the street.


Brock Lane said all 3 robbers pointed AK-47 weapons at him before one of the men fired a shot at his head. The bullet missed his head by inches but it knocked him to the ground. Lane, 30, is recovering after the robbery. He was shot with an AK-47 by men who he believes were trying to rob him.


The robbers chased Lane about three blocks before he was shot in the right shoulder and right hand, Lane said. They then took off in a silver SUV and took off south on Rainier Avenue. They tried to use a silver-colored or black 4-door sedan, but it is believed two of them, one in each vehicle, shot Lane at least once with their AK-47 weapons and fled the area on foot.


Lane described the assailants as white and being in their 20s to early 30s, standing about 6 feet to 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing about 210 pounds. They wore black ski masks and gloves, and all three had backpacks. The robbers stole Lane's cell phone, money, keys and jewelry.
