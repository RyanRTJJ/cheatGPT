The Government will be asked by the European Commission to guarantee that Britain does not "divert defence assets" for other countries and a similar issue must be resolved before Britain signs up to a future EU defence spending plan.

The Government has made no secret of its desire to create a British Navy in time for the referendum. David Cameron wants to start building for it on the Clyde, and has said if he does not he will step down as Prime Minister.

Last week Downing Street announced a decision on which companies will receive tenders for the £10 billion replacement carriers the UK Navy says are needed by 2026-27 and which are expected to cost £7.5 billion.

The firms to be awarded the contracts were narrowed down from 12 to six, with two being cut and the decision announced in London. The Government wants the new carriers to be able to carry up to 64 fixed-wing aircraft and 28 helicopters.

But only four of the six bidders were British. The Department for Transport is due to announce on November 21 which of them will win a £1.1bn contract to design and manufacture a new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth.

The company is likely to be selected from a shortlist of six which was drawn up by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) earlier this year. It will be the second company to be shortlisted for the job which has caused considerable debate in Britain.

In May there was uproar after a German company, Rheinmetall, was refused a £1.5bn contract to upgrade Britain's ageing carriers by 2025 through a competition overseen by the CAA. The Foreign Office had to intervene and promise it would not "divert" national resources to a foreign competitor.

Under UK procurement rules the Government must commit to protecting the Government's procurement priorities if an EU country is in dispute with the EC. It may now step in to help its potential competitor if the Government is concerned that the bid by Rheinmetall failed to meet the Government's "competent authority" standards. It is worth noting that
