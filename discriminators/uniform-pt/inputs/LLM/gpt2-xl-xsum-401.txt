 officer, Dr Philippa Whitford, who said the Welsh government have now "a duty to do everything they can to ensure that people's lives and health are not put at risk as they live in homes affected by this problem".

Mrs Whitford also said the Welsh government's failure to make improvements to its care in Wales had been so serious during her time as chief medical officer it had "stumped" senior health staff. She has now set up the health group of ministers to make "better use of its limited resources".

The Welsh Health Journal believes that Wales might benefit from taking a different strategy. Many people who had to move out because of old age are unlikely to go out and buy property for the same reason â€“ they find it is cheaper to stay in bed for life.

This paper, written by Dr Paul Dacre and Dr Jonathan Wilcox, will compare the health of council and housing association tenants living on both properties and will use data from a new study set to be published by researchers at the University of Warwick, which follows thousands of elderly people in the UK over their 70s. While the study found that people in areas that had large numbers of elderly people were much less likely to die in their 70s than those in other areas, the findings were not uniform.

Wales' current government has made a number of announcements on the provision of homes suitable for older people, including an early warning system on the homes that have already been bought. But, according to research published this week, council estate workers often "lose track" of those people who need home care. For example, when they check a newly replaced dwelling they might find a carer living there, but it could well have been left empty for a year or two after it was last inhabited.
