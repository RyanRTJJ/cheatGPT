 I/O conference a year earlier. It had been a slow-rolling roll-out, though, as it had only been in limited production. As an early 2016 deadline came and went with no new products in sight, Google began looking for a new corporate owner. By April of this year, Google had narrowed down its contenders to just three companies, which eventually settled on Sharp.

Google had started to feel more secure about its vision of a mobile device that has a lot of unique, highly-custom functionality. "It's a little bit like in the car industry," says Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's top Android executive and another former Samsung executive. "It's not just about whether we have a really good engine. It's about whether it makes the car go faster."

As a result, the company was eager to find another partner. Sharp, which Google had considered a partner during the previous round of phone manufacturing talks, had been more than enthusiastic in talking about its own manufacturing plans. The only real catch was that Sharp could only develop two types of Android chips inside its factory, a decision Google was happy with.

As part of the deal, Google will take a 20 percent stake in Sharp. That deal is still not complete, however, although companies will soon be announcing formal plans to use the Sharp factory as part of their own chips. With the contract in place, Sharp can continue to build its own chips, and the rest of its technology may be used for other projects outside of smartphones.
