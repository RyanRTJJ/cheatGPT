 new plant in the Queen's Necklace and invest Â£600m to create 1,000 new high-quality jobs.

Ms May said she was pleased the tech company will invest here, according to The Times of London. "The fact that Apple is choosing to build some of its facilities in the UK and create some employment here is a very good sign going forward, I think."

The firm said yesterday after a meeting between Mr Cook and Ms May that a British exit from the 28-nation bloc could affect the company's future plans. "Obviously as a company with lots of employees around the world it would be hard to predict what would happen if we were to leave the EU," it said.

Apple has previously been open to a move to a "single market", however a key issue in the EU referendum debate has been the so-called "divorce bill" for the bill to leave the union.

Apple yesterday pledged to create new job opportunities when it builds its new facility for iPhone and iPad technology in the Queen's Necklace; it did not specify how many jobs would be created in the new factory, in east London.

The firm is not the only high-tech firm planning to move operations from northern Europe to a cheaper Britain after Brexit, as companies including Amazon and Facebook are expected to follow suit.

"We're committed to investing in the UK and creating jobs. Whether we are based here or not, our UK technology teams are committed to working together to furthering the UK economy," the letter stated.

Despite the firm's pledge, Prime Minister Theresa May said Wednesday she wants "a new relationship" with the EU.

"We want a new relationship with the EU where we have greater economic cooperation together. We will respect the outcome of the referendum but we expect that the way that we do that is by having an orderly withdrawal," she told MPs.

Meanwhile on Wednesday, Brexit Secretary David Davis announced that the first batch of UK-made bananas will arrive on the shelves of UK supermarkets in December.
