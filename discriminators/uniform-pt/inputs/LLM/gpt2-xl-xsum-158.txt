 1980s, including claims that a former home secretary, Leon Brittan, was involved in a paedophile ring that involved MPs and other public figures.

However, he was cleared of any involvement after a series of legal challenges.

One claim was that he had visited a care home in the 1970s where there was evidence of abuse. No charges were brought due to insufficient evidence.

Operation Fernbridge was opened earlier this year after another series of legal challenges.

Detective chief inspector Dave Green, of Norfolk police, said a senior detective on the case felt it had become necessary to investigate whether police were not properly investigating allegations around child sex allegations against Brittan.

It has been established that the NCA would look as a co-operative external agency at the request of Scotland Yard.

It would continue to co-operate with Norfolk police and other forces involved in the investigation. The NCA did not say if it was investigating any of the claims.
