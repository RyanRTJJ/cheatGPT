. In the 2011-12 year, the Justice Raveendran committee submitted a report after which the government came up with amendments to the law and the court had reviewed the implementation of the provisions.

"It's very well known, especially in the urban areas, that women are harassed by their families if the dowry is not paid," one police officer said. "During her course in police training, she came across a case where the girl had not got her rights. So, she decided to find out how such cases happen."

She began investigating the matter after a person approached her asking for help.

"I started talking to people, talking to her family and others and it became clear that the mother was doing something wrong. Her husband, who was unemployed, tried to bribe the girl (daughter of the alleged victim) to get the rights and the family even went to court to get compensation. The court also sanctioned cash compensation," the officer said.

According to the officer, the accused usually went out and bought or borrowed large amounts of jewelry and other valuables including gold and silver.

"All of a sudden when the money was due, the girl was kidnapped by her family and she was forced to marry them. Because of the financial crisis, she left for some years…and her family has not bothered to find out where she is. They went to a court and got compensation from the court. After that, we can't verify the case," she said.

Another police official says the police is often called to the spot to take over cases of harassment of women.

"Every year, there are thousands of dowry incidents — men are forced to marry girls they don't want, and then women are raped… So, the police has to investigate all the cases of women being raped. Also, the court has put dowry cases under the stringent anti-dowry law, and the accused have to give dowry amount as proof
