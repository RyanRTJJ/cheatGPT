The 32-year-old's dominance in American shores has not gone unnoticed.

Rogan got the big nod from promoter Bob Arum over Wladimir Klitschko in a one-night fight earlier this year, on the grounds that he had enough name recognition to make it a ratings boon for NBC.

Rogan made his U.S debut in May by stopping former lightweight world title challenger Jhonny Gonzalez in three rounds. The win was his first straight, with a string of four victories against lesser ranked opposition in between.

Lomachenko, 24, was raised in New York City but has always been the underdog since his pro debut against Terrence Crawford in 2012. The Ukrainian is known for his speed with a knack for using footwork and power to counter his adversaries. He has not been beaten since his last defeat to Roman Klimov in 2013.

With a win, Lomachenko can keep his focus on the Olympics but the fact that he will have to face two of the fighters he beat with the same style in the ring can be a cause for concern for him and his trainers.

While Lomachenko can be seen as the most dangerous of all, it is a measure of the depth of his talent that he has been able to win titles in each of boxing's three major weight classes.

There is a fear that the new WBA regulations imposed on the sanctioning body may have the opposite effect and discourage the emergence of stars like Lomachenko who would normally gain the interest of US investors, particularly as a way to keep boxing alive at a time when television ratings are falling.

Lomachenko says he is aware of the situation, but said he is fully aware of his options.

"It's a very good situation for boxing," he said. "When I start training, I start with a clean slate."

Asked where he could fight first, Lomachenko said while he wanted the IBF title to come his way, he would not hold that over anyone else.

"I am doing a boxing tour around the U.S. and all the major cities are there,"
