As I rode away from my home planet, I looked back and all I saw was destruction. The screams, the fire, and the despair of my loved ones all felt like a punch to the gut. What had once been a proud and beautiful world was now reduced to nothing but dust in the wind. 

My heart felt like it was constricting and bile rose in my throat. The tears ran down my cheeks as I thought of all the things I had lost. All of the memories, the moments of joy and laughter, the loved ones that I had to leave behind. 

I know that I did the only thing I could do, but it still doesn't make it any easier. The only thing I could do was leave. I could have done more, maybe done something to prevent this, but I will never be sure. 

One thing was certain, I had to leave. In the end, my greatest hope was that someday, someone would find a way of rebuilding the world I had left behind. That, at least, I could cling to. 

As I flew away from Earth, the sun setting on my home planet below me, I wasn't sure what the future held for me. I just had to hope that the universe was kind, and that the beauty of Earth never faded away from memory. That the people I had left behind would find peace and forgiveness, and that healing could take place one day. 

Those were my final thoughts as I flew away from what was left of my home.
