 and early elections, including the re-run of last year's vote for governor of the capital, which Yanukovich won.

The new prime minister will be nominated on Thursday. That could leave the pro-EU candidate, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, as Ukraine's head of state at a time when the United States and the European Union are pressing their Western allies to provide more economic aid, and when the Kremlin's isolation increases in Ukraine's former Russian territories.

Ukraine's political crisis has escalated since Yanukovich rejected a deal with the European Union in November, triggering demonstrations that forced the president from office and brought the Kremlin's isolation to new highs.

In a statement, the presidential administration said the prime minister, Azarov, would be asked to resign. The statement said the cabinet would convene on Thursday and a new prime minister would be named from among his deputies.

A statement from Arseniy Yatsenyuk's political party said the party's leader had been summoned to the presidential administration. Yatsenyuk was head of the national security Council until the end of last month, underlining his influence in Kiev.

But opposition parties said after Yanukovich's sudden resignation they were prepared to consider new prime ministers. The head of the presidential administration, Oleksandr Turchynov, was in talks to hold new elections, the opposition said, declining to comment on whether Yanukovich would remain in office.

Ukraine's new anti-corruption chief, Vitaliy Yarema, said the first day of talks with a pro-Russian bloc in Kiev would be his last with them. Many had hoped Yarema could be a mediator amid the confrontation between Yanukovich's backers and those calling for him to step down.

The interim government set up a state prosecutor's office on Wednesday to investigate officials alleged to have been in the pocket of Yanukovich in order to boost international confidence in a democratic process in Ukraine. The prosecutor said he would prosecute "anyone who takes bribe under any circumstances and pays off the armed groups."
