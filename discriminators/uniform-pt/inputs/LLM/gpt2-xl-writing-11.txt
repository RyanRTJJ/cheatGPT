Lunatics and Fanatics


The two camps make for a good rivalry. The real winner is the madmen and fanatics. They don't put up with BS and they don't care if they're mad. Their own agenda is the most important thing to THEM, not whatever your bullshit ideology says on Earth.


However, the crazies won't tolerate stupidity. They'll call their names when they're getting to you and they'll make sure that YOU know how to back off!


The crazies were the first to strike when we first arrived, which was a bit difficult. To keep your composure, you had to show your craziness, which of course was more of an instinctive display so we didn't have to do anything extra for a while. Now the madness has begun to die down and sanity is returning on a regular basis. Now we have to keep on a watchful eye and keep the crazies in line.
