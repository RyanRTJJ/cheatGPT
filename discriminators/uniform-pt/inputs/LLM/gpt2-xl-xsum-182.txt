 Michael Cheika, who returns to the helm of the nation's test team in time for the World Cup, spoke for many of the commentators when he used the rugby union series as an opportunity to educate Americans and Australians in the sport's nuances.

"We will go towards the world cup and the future of the sport and there will be a lot going on in those tournaments," Cheika said after the end of England's 38-16 win over Scotland.

The RFU wants to re-engage with Americans in ways similar to when Cheika led the Wallabies to a victory in the World Cup final in 2011. "We've never done it but it's worth looking at," he said. "We will have a couple [of trials] but it's not going to start in earnest until the World Cup."

"The next World Cup could just be a huge step-up for the Aussie game as well," Cheika said. "In the last World Cup we tried
