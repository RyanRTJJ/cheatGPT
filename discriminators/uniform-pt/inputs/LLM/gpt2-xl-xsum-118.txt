 battling flames, which are being fought by fire crews, helicopters and vehicles.

Media outlets quoting officials said about 25 firefighters still were unaccounted for.

At least two of the 12 reactors at the Fukushima plant in northeastern Japan suffered meltdowns after the March 2011 quake and tsunami caused a massive tsunami that battered surrounding areas.

Japan suffered the worst nuclear disasters for its post-war history, leaving tens of thousands of people dead or injured.

The country has since tried to rebuild, but its nuclear industry has gone from strength to strength and remains one of the biggest employers.

Anastasia Yurkova had travelled for over 1,000 miles with little idea of the dangers she was facing.

Her journey from Yekaterinburg to the town of Chernobyl on the Kamchatka peninsula had begun in December but was disrupted by a snowstorm around New Year.

But it all came to a sudden halt on Monday when she was forced to stop on the street near the city of Samara without a car.

"I had no bread," she said. "Just hot churros and something to drink."

She was not allowed into a local ambulance service station to ask for basic supplies but she was able to walk all the way to Chernobyl.

Anastasia survived only by eating grass, berries and berries on trees she found.

She said she was not scared despite the dire situation she faced.
