 called for the introduction of a regulatory system, while campaigners have said the introduction of alcohol provision through the Health Service was a "significant failure".

Professor Jane Campbell, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said the service was working to reduce alcohol consumption. "Alcohol is a problem for those at risk of developing cancer and we are working with partners to encourage people to drink less and to reduce the amount that they drink," she said.

"Despite evidence to the contrary, an increase in the price of alcohol has been used as an excuse to delay and undermine progress to reduce alcohol consumption, and there should be no place for that in public health."

Dr Susan Jebb, chief executive of the cancer charity Breast Cancer and a consultant on diet and cancer prevention, said: "Clearly there is scope for regulation of alcohol but it would have to be clear that it's about reducing harm – not about increasing access to alcohol.

"One area our work shows is that there are plenty of health benefits of socialising for children and young people. They really struggle to connect with their peers. If they drink alcohol they may have a more positive social support network."

In 2010, the BMA published a report documenting some of the consequences for people who drink excessively but drinking restrictions for pregnant and nursing mothers were not on the table at the time.

Earlier this week, the Labour cabinet minister, Stephen Twigg, said he plans to introduce a minimum price for alcohol in England. A consultation by the Department of Health, which plans to introduce price controls next April, has so far received 1,400 responses.

Crown Estate chief executive Stephen Holt said he welcomed the potential introduction of minimum alcohol pricing, saying: "Alcohol is a serious problem for people who don't manage their time wisely and it's not good for the health or well-being of future generations." The Guardian revealed last year that the estate has lost nearly £6m a year due to alcohol-related health problems and fatalities.
