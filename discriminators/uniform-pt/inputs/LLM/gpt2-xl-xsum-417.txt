 trial in the country's postwar history. (For the most updated, interactive timeline of the investigation, check out the map of allegations here.)

One of the first things the media reported about the corruption allegations was that there were reports of a huge political bribe, around $22 million, that implicated the government. Romanian media initially reported a figure of $25 million, but later corrected it to $22 million. Many news outlets have refused to run this story at all.

On Dec. 13, a judge ordered that the case be adjourned to March to give prosecutors time to investigate the case, and to examine possible ties between Ponta and the owners of a property of the prime minister's wife before the next national elections, which could take place in the fall of 2017.

But just five days before this hearing, the prosecution started issuing summonses for an arrest to an unnamed person named in media reports of a massive scandal. A few days later, Ponta was arrested and a judge ordered his "prosecution for criminal behavior." In the early hours of Dec. 16, the former prime minister and the general manager of the state-owned Carrefour supermarket chain were released on home confinement until late January 2017.

This was hardly good news for Corina Cretu, who has been campaigning for a "yes" vote on April 24. As soon as news of the arrest filtered through social networks and news outlets, support for the prime minister dropped off sharply. That's especially shocking considering Romania's long history of political activism, an example that Cretu likes to use to explain her opposition to the new government:

The struggle for democracy continued in Romania until 1989-90, where the Romanian people defended their values against the communist dictatorship. That's what Romania is about after all.


The current government is simply doing the same thing that the previous one was doing, which was taking a very difficult
