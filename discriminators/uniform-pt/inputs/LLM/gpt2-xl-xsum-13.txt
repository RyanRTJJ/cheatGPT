 the Welsh Ambulance Service and his colleague, Mr P Rynn, were on a rescue boat and were attempting to attend the pitch when there was a massive crash.

Both men had to be taken to A&E.

"We were just at the pitch and there was a huge bang," Mr Samuel said.

"We turned around and saw there were people lying on the pitch. People were scattered about and it seemed like quite a large amount of people had been injured."

The helicopter crews of Air Ambulance and Rhondda Air Ambulance were called out to help.

In a statement Rhondda Air Ambulance said the medical helicopter, based at nearby Tredegar, had been forced to divert to Pontypridd to provide care at A&E.

The helicopter crew from RGC 1404 arrived at the pitch immediately after the crash, it said.

A second helicopter from RGC 1404 was also on standby in the city centre to assist in the transport of the two teams involved at the pitch.

Rachael Beasley, manager of Pontypridd FC, said all of her staff were "distraught over the incident" and had been "assured" by the helicopter crew that the injuries were not life-threatening.

Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) managing director Roger Lewis confirmed that their players were in the ambulance when they arrived at the pitch on Saturday night.

He added that their initial concerns were "that somebody had been knocked over in the mayhem and knocked in the head"

The accident was being treated as an "unintentional act" by those "who had to be treated at the scene" rather than by "any issues that the game and the tournament will bring to the ground", he said.
