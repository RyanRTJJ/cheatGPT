 Queen Victoria, for second place, surpassing the record held by her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria as the longest-reigning monarch in Britain.

The record for the number of consecutive British monarchs that have been on the throne is seven, set by Queen Victoria before her death. The monarchs who have followed in her footsteps are Sir Winston Churchill, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (later Queen Elizabeth II), Elizabeth II, George VI, George VI, Diana, Princess of Wales, Margaret Thatcher, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

This year marks a year since Queen Elizabeth II was crowned the longest-reigning British monarch. Her coronation, which took place on June 6, 1952 at Westminster Abbey, happened on the first day of the first month in 1953 -- the same day her father's coronation did, back in 1910.

The oldest head of state in the world right now, Elizabeth II has just turned 90 -- meaning she's still going strong. She's now a head of a government with a healthy treasury and a healthy economy. The average age for our current presidents and prime ministers in the United States is 71, and the average for heads of government for the world's leading country is 78.

With Elizabeth II's reign currently at 55 years, her youngest female predecessor, Queen Victoria, would have made it through just 10 years as queen in less than the time it took Elizabeth to become Britain's longest-reigning monarch. She died aged 95 in 1936, just 29 days after becoming queen.

Elizabeth's reign has come at a time in British life where our government would have been making decisions that would make people uncomfortable back in 1910. Since then, politicians have tried to distance themselves from politics, to avoid public accusations. But while today's politicians may not speak publicly about their political opinions, the Queen's reign has still had a very active political and social life, and Elizabeth is still very much engaged in public life.
