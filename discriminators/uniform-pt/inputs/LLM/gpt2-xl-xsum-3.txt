 a rise on 2012's combined figures, which stood at just over £2m.

The overall revenue came from record shops, record labels, retailers, music publishers and the independent music trade association BMI.

In a statement, BMI said all the revenue was thanks to the continued "massive" sale and distribution of records, including online. "Sales of albums were up 20 per cent and sales of singles were up nearly twice as much," it said.

"This means the new record sales figures prove again that the online services continue to offer great value as they help people discover new music and discover the best new music," said BMI chief executive Mike Wadsworth. "With over 4,000 digital songs available in the UK and more than 100 million songs in circulation globally, it is very exciting to see this growing market growing so swiftly."

The music industry employs 4.6m people in the UK, with more than a million having jobs in the music industry, according to industry estimates. The UK's population is 66.1 million.

The charting albums in the UK album charts:

1. Ed Sheeran, + (+23,000 copies).

2. Sam Smith, In The Lonely Hour (+19,000) and +2 (+25,000).

3. Ed Sheeran, X (+6,000).

4. Imagine Dragons, Night Visions (+6,000).

5. Taylor Swift, Bad Blood (+5,000) and Red (£3,600).

8. Selena Gomez, Good For You (£2,000).

9. Ed Sheeran, X (+8,000) and +8.5 (+37,000).

Albums sold via physical formats on CD (other than albums) now account for 30 per cent of the UK album sales market.

The figures also showed a significant fall in UK sales of vinyl records, with the total now standing at more than £2.4m, compared to £2.6
