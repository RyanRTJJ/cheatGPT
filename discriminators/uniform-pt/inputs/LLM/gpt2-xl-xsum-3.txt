vertical strikethroughs, rather than the more familiar round ones. "Every computer can't represent these," he said.

The zeros are made with a special material that is found in sand. By applying a constant electric charge, an electric current can be formed in the material, which can then be used to produce a zeroes.

"This is super-important for us," said Bling. The material is "a very cheap, accessible material that can potentially be a new, cheap replacement for many of the zeros we have."

"We've designed the device so that it's small enough to carry around… it's probably the smallest electronics that you can find on the market," he added.

While scientists have previously created electricity out of air, this is the first time something so small has been done.

The team is still working on how best to transport the device. "The current I have is pretty small," said Bling. "The best thing we can do is try and get the most charge to it that we can."

As the team works on how best to build the device, the team says a demonstration is still something they would like to do. "We may end up using it as a system to generate electricity from raindrops," they said in their explanation.

The research was carried out at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA, while the device cost $20 (£12) to make.

"As a designer, it's exciting," said Bling. "The ability to imagine an entirely new field of study is very exciting to me."

The team is interested in using the technology for other possible uses too: "I am imagining a few other possible applications," said Bling. For example, energy could eventually be generated by the motion of the sun. As the sun moves through our atmosphere the electrical current generated will "generate electricity for use in the solar cells where it would be stored and transferred to other parts of the world."

One other possible application for the zeroes is to build a computer. As they continue to research the material, the team says more possibilities are open to them. "This
