"The Scots do not appear to have much of a say in Scotland's constitutional future, and it is only likely that the UK government will seek to get Scotland into line in the EU negotiations," said Shaw.

"As long as that cannot be achieved, however, and the issue remains a sticking point in the first Brexit negotiation, a Scottish government would continue to face pressure to take tough decisions – which would most likely result in more independence."

The Scottish government confirmed this week that the country's ministers would have to consider independence as an option for their own constitutional future while negotiating with the UK government.

In the UK, devolved administrations have generally assumed that any changes to the constitution – including independence – must be agreed through direct democratic mandate of voters.

"It is in the interest of both Scotland and the rest of the UK, in particular the devolved administrations, that this matter proceeds beyond the negotiations now under way," the secretary of state said.

"No decision can be taken under section 30 as soon as Article 50 formally comes into force with the UK government."

David Mundell, Scotland's finance secretary, echoed Sturgeon's assertion that Scotland would need to be considered under Article 50, rather than under the constitutional arrangements in place at Holyrood.

"There are a range of constitutional powers that could be altered," Mundell told BBC radio.

He added that, once negotiations were ongoing, the Scottish government hoped a resolution would be agreed for Scotland.

"What we want is to be a member of the EU, but we want an agreed exit in relation to that referendum," he said.

"I don't think that requires an Act of Parliament, but it certainly would require agreement by the European Commission," the Scottish government's spokesman said on Tuesday.

Alex Salmond said on Tuesday that the situation was "nowhere near being settled" and he was still hoping for "some kind of agreement" between Edinburgh and London "before the end of the week".

"The UK government's position has always been on the assumption that an independent Scotland would withdraw rather than staying in," Salmond said.
