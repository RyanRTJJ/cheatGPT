 two weeks before the opening matches of the Olympics, in which Rio is hosting the opening ceremony, it is understood that Hickey is a subject of one of Brazil's criminal inquiries.

Former New Zealand rugby captain Colin Slade has been charged with one count of conspiring or assisting with another person to commit illegal sporting activity and one count of providing false or misleading evidence, Rio police official Aloysio Pessoa said. Pessoa said the rugby league player was released on bail earlier this month and the alleged offence concerned his involvement in a match fixing scandal in 2010.

Pessoa said the rugby league player and several others had agreed to pay $US1.15 million in the alleged scheme. The alleged match fixing scandal occurred during the 2009 Rugby League World Cup and involved former Australian representative and rugby league match fixer and team owner Tony Veitch.

Police said that during questioning, Mr Sibary confessed he and several others were involved in a number of match fixing incidents involving the Australian team during Sydney 2008 and Melbourne 2009. They said Mr Pessoa and Mr Hickey discussed the alleged incident, which took place during a 2010 meeting of Mr Sibary to discuss match fixing, during a hearing at a Magistrates Court in Rio de Janeiro. Mr Sibary had also earlier confessed to the allegations.

At the time of the offences, Mr Sibary was a member of the Australian team.
