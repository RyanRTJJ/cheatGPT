____________ ______________________________________ Piano of the forest by Sarah Prentiss This story is based on a true story about a pair of twins from Michigan known as the Snedekers. Their father and twin brother died in a motorcycle accident in 1953, when one was about ten weeks old. The other was born four years later, but was stillborn at six months. It is estimated that that the twins spent twenty-eight months in a dark, cold cage in the back of a truck. The truck was filled with the bodies of children who died of starvation in the Polish Auschwitz. The twins were kept for weeks in order to give the impression that they were healthy children.

The Snedekers were eventually awarded $1 million in compensation. Despite all the abuse in the foster care system John and Charles have been extremely close and have been in love since they were four years old. They moved into an elegant apartment, shared with their parents and one
