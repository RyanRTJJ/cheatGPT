 Romans (including the infamous Carthaginians) and Byzantinians. From the 9th century, a Christian monk by the name of Saint George built the basilica. In 1203, it fell to a Muslim general, who moved the castle into Sicily, which later became part of the Kingdom of Sicily and then became an independent state (later called Sicily). The basilica was restored in the late 1960s after a war between the "good army" of the British monarchy and the "bad army" of the Roman Catholic Church against the Muslim population, which lost the war.

"The Church doesn't have any real claim to the land," a historian by the name of Nicola Leggio told The Telegraph back in 2008. "There are over a dozen churches just across the road, and I'm sure the Catholics will take any opportunity they can to put up shop here."

The Italian state owns a piece of the land. According to Leggio, the Vatican is one of the largest landowners in the Basilica Of St. Maria Goretti, and a majority share is owned by the Vatican's "secretariat of state." There's also a Catholic state-owned supermarket, but no Catholic priests. That said, since the building was built in the 12th century, there were no actual bishops or priests living in the church.

What's more, at this point there's a rumor flying around that the church is in a state of "immediate danger." It's impossible to tell what's true and what's not. But the rumors are definitely making the rounds, so stay away if you're not a visitor from New York or Boston. The only reason this is even on my list is because we already know how scary the Basilica is. And it's not going down easily. Stay away from this church, too:
