 still no effective drug against fungi.

"We're facing a whole arsenal of fungal infections in places we never expected to be so exposed," said Professor Gow.

"We've seen all kinds of unusual fungal infections in health and environmental sites. These pathogens are everywhere."

He said fungi had spread around the world in the last few decades.

'It is very interesting'

"We know that the majority of fungi we encounter have an origins in Eurasia, and therefore have had a dramatic effect on the spread of exotic and exotic human pathogens, as well as bringing exotic fungi into the west where Europeans are living at present."

He said that fungi can "jump" between animals and plants â€“ a factor that could be of great benefit to people who are being exposed or are experiencing a reaction to them.

"Even in cases where we are not infected by a fungus, it is very interesting really," he said.

Professor Gow said there might be some areas of the world with high populations of fungi, and there were a few areas where it was difficult to control.

"Some fungi have a greater ability to jump from one organism to another of plant or animal than others do.

"Where there is no control of another species in the same vicinity of what is causing disease, we're more likely to get contact with the disease that is causing the fungal infection."

He said people in developing countries tended to be at higher risk of acquiring fungal infections as the microbes were being "dispersed" by animals, and their fungi were spreading around the world.

"This shows that we may be more prone to the diseases that we're most susceptible to," he said.

"There are areas where there are a lot of different diseases being spread among species of plants, even though we haven't been able to do anything about it there."
