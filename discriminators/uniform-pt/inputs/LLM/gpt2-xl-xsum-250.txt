 Mr. Trump said the day after Mr. Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton made controversial remarks about the attack in an American-made video. "It's about courage."

Mr. Obama said in an interview with the Web site BuzzFeed this month that if the media were doing its job, he "fully" believed that "people are mad as hell, and they're not going to take it anymore." Mr. Trump was one of two senior Republican contenders to weigh in on last Sunday's attack.

"Obviously, we need more security. This could have been a lot worse, but we'll see what happens in the future," Mr. Trump said in the interview. "There must be a lot of anger" among the Muslims who were cheering the assault on Mr. al-Awlaki, the radical imam.

The Obama administration on Friday issued a new rule requiring all visitors from countries that have joined the European Union in rejecting the principle of "free movement" to have their digital records logged and shared with the government. On Thursday, the State Department said it would begin accepting calls placed from nonimmigrant visa holders at an Internet cafe in Havana, Cuba.

Mr. Trump's comments were in sharp contrast to those of other Republican candidates who have tried to distance themselves from Mr. Trump, with former Gov. Jeb Bush suggesting before the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday that he wouldn't defend him. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida senator, said Mr. Trump had no business running for the White House. And some candidates were more measured, suggesting they would let Mr. Trump run his campaign however he saw fit.

In a statement distributed by the campaign Friday morning, Mr. Trump said the debate was over over a lack of information, but called for greater security. "We should open our border to people fleeing conflict, violence and hardship," he said.

While the debate over border measures gained momentum last year, Democrats have been sharply critical of Mr. Trump's more bellicose rhetoric.
