Airways for its alleged links with Iran and its support of terrorism and the war on Yemen.

The chief executive of Qantas, Alan Joyce, will tell the Qatar Business Council (QBC) how the airline can create jobs around the world, particularly in Wales.

The Welsh government is due to hold a meeting with executives from Qatar Airways in Cardiff on Tuesday to discuss the potential of the new route.

He will warn ministers that it's in the best interests of Welsh-based businesses to invest in the region, and to ensure there is no complacency as sanctions on Qatar are imposed.

Mr Joyce will say: "The announcement that Britain is to start selling Qantas flights to Doha was greeted by a standing ovation from the audience.

"On Monday, it took just 15 minutes for the UK government to sanction Qatar after its alleged links with Tehran.

"But before this decision is even made, it is in the best interests of Welsh-based businesses in Qatar that sanctions be lifted. Wales has a rich potential for growth and innovation in the Middle East."

But questions have been raised about the viability of the route, and how it will work with the current arrangements between Qatar Airways and Emirates.

Mr Joyce will tell QBC that he will have a briefing for the government on Wednesday, as he prepares to open negotiations with the Gulf nation.

He will warn ministers that any deals would put pressure on them to maintain the status quo regarding the Doha-Tbilisi-Amman route, which the UK government has identified as the next best alternative.

"A good start would be to secure a long-term agreement which includes Qatar continuing to be a member of the alliance along with Emirates," he said.

He added: "It is in the best interests
