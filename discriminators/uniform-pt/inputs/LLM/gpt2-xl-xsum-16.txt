In her report, Ms Lambeth cites the 'lack of support' of her teachers, staff and parents. The school, she explains, 'came in at the bottom of this report and has been held up as an example of how to run a successful school'.

She notes: 'I also think that the school and community will be better served if you have a team of dedicated and experienced teachers instead of putting them in a position where they need to focus on the safety aspects of a situation but not be able to do things that are necessary to effectively teach the kids'.

The report, written by Ms Lambeth's colleague from the department of education Dr. Julie Taylor, cites no specific policy failures, but does suggest that staff 'do not have a high level of confidence or are not confident with the students on their own'.

This is likely to ring alarm bells for parents like John and Susan Smith, of Woodbridge, Virginia, who have two daughters attending the school.

Mr Smith said that after his daughter was injured near her school in October last year, he decided to take his daughter home after three weeks at school instead, but teachers are now required to leave after just two days.

'It's been very difficult,' Mr Smith explained. 'She had back discomfort, she's still on pain medication [for her back], and the doctor would not release her until the end of the school year as she was too sore to go back to class.

According to the outlet, he said his role at the school is to ensure the school is in compliance
