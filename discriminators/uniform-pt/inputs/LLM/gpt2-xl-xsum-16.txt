Porto before joining Everton from the Portuguese team in 2012, winning two Barclays Premier League titles.

However, when the Blues fell to the brink of going out of the Champions League and they had to endure a bitter end to last season that eventually saw them dropped from the competition, Goncalves did not step in.

Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck insisted at the time that Goncalves would still remain in charge despite the club's poor start and after a series of mixed results over the past few weeks, the Blues' new coach is facing a difficult decision.

The Toffees have gone three league games without a Premier League clean sheet, a run that has seen them slip to fifth. Goncalves has previously been criticised for his defensive work, including criticising a back four that was heavily criticised at the end of last season.

Chelsea will be desperate to win this weekend's crucial home game against Huddersfield Town, which has given them a real opportunity to kick-start their season, but they have also been frustrated by a lack of consistency.

It has been clear all term that Chelsea have been unable to find the form that led to 11 successive wins between September and November, their last four league matches ending 0-0. Goncalves has spent much of the first part of the season in talks about a potential move from Chelsea to Inter.
