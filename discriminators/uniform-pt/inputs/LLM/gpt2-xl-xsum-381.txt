 the water level in the bay had been going up.

"Some of our boats are at 50 feet (15 metres) in the bay - you can't get through," he said.

Some are still taking people on board their charter boats who have been stranded at sea.

One passenger was taken off the board of the boat by police on Monday, but has since been released. The water is now too high for the passengers to float back on board.

Campground residents said they could not afford accommodation on the island.

"The situation on this island has got so bad we've only got one room on the island - we have enough beds on the main road but not here."

One passenger, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said they had been forced back to the mainland by high tide - which have been rising by between 1.7 and 2.6 metres (5.5 to 8.4 feet).

"We'd been walking for four or five hours from the main road and [the tide was coming in] like a wave -
