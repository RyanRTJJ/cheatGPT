What causes an egg to be laid in a human?

Mosquitoes lay millions of egg and each egg contains a single set of mosquito larvae. Once an egg is laid in an individual, larvae feed on blood and can travel up the length of the body to the heart, lungs, brain, eyes or other organs. Then the egg hatches and the female lays more eggs. Over time, the number of eggs laid is reduced, but the mosquito stays alive and capable of laying more eggs.
