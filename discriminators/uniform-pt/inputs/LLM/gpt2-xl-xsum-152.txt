's an unbelievable feeling in my heart," he said. "I'm absolutely delighted to be here."

Orica GreenEdge chief operating officer Matt White called him an "outstanding ambassador" who is "very professional" and "able to provide a good example to other young players".

"It's pretty tough to make a team," added White. "They're all young guys and they can learn pretty much all from Conor."

Wright won the British Tour's Under 23 Championship earlier this year with Northern Ireland and said he would be relishing the chance to do it all again.

"There's no pressure at this level of golf," he said. "It's all about being consistent, and this is still quite a high point of the season. I'm looking forward to the challenge ahead."

Orica GreenEdge's Simon Gerrans is the first British champion in nine years

Orica-GreenEdge captain Simon Gerrans also described him as "a great role model for the younger players here on the team".

"He's a very consistent golfer. He's always competitive which you look for from young players like Conor. I think he'll be doing well over here."

Orica-GreenEdge are one of the world's most successful teams on the European tour at the moment, having recently won the Tour of California and finished second to Sky in last year's Vuelta a Espana.

Their first event after the Australian leg of the season will be the British and Irish Open earlier this month.

The British Open, which begins 18 days later, finishes in London on 1st July.

BBC Sport has learned that the BBC is to be given an exclusive "look", in the manner of television presenters, of each team that emerges from this autumn's Tour of Britain.

Orica-GreenEdge and Astana are confirmed to have a live feed of the Australian Tour.
