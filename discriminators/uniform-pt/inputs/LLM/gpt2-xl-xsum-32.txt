a court order to remove a sign which read: "In loving memory of James and Margaret McMurray - two men who died tragically in a car crash on September 18 2003 at 11.10am while travelling to the Western Isles of Scotland to celebrate James's 50th birthday." The couple also removed the plaque, which had been placed by the council, from their local church.

The presiding magistrate, Ciaran Murray, said: "The two of you will have spent many years thinking about this case and regret the contempt you both have displayed by the actions you have committed.

"In my view this type of behaviour will not be tolerated. I hope this case brings about your conviction."

He added: "In many respects this is a sad and tragic case, but it was made even more distressing by the fact the two of you each committed your crimes in different ways.

"It might be the case that those two acts were the beginning of an ongoing project that you had engaged in for decades, one that resulted in death, both of you."

Earlier, Ian and Elaine Murray admitted a charge of making a malicious communication between 9pm on 30 October 2012 and 5am on December 29 2012. They have been granted suspended prison sentences.

For Mr McMurray, who died in 2008, this means a maximum sentence of two years. For Mrs McMurray, it means two-and-a-half years. Both still must serve a 15-day jail sentence.

The judge ruled that Ian McMurray, a former bus driver and council employee, and Elaine McMurray, a former school secretary, had conspired together to cause the death of their friend, James, after he crashed his Vauxhall Astra into a lamppost at Kilmarnock in September 2003.

The pair both claimed they had forgotten his birthday at the time of James's death and he was not their friend.

At the time of his death, only Elaine McMurray was still aware she was expecting a baby girl. She had also given birth to son, John Thomas, in a hospital in July 2008.

The pair both gave police reports claiming they were oblivious to James McMurray's death. Their defence lawyers
