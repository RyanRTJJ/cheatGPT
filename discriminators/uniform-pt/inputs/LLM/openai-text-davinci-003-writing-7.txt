It began with an innocent desire to find a new home; one with more space now that the family had grown. After months of searching, Joe and his family finally arrived at their dream home. The new home was somewhat isolated, deep in the countryside and Joe had visions of long cozy evenings by the fire. 

Their excitement was dampened slightly as they entered the basement however, when they noticed a suspicious old journal lying on the floor. Joe picked it up and realized that it was incredibly ancient. On closer inspection, Joe's jaw dropped when he noticed the title of the book: A journal of a vampire. 

Joe was stunned and unsure how to react. He imagined it couldn't have been left there recently; it seemed to be exactly 100 years old. He thumbed through the pages and noticed some exquisite illustrations of mythical creatures and spells. But there were also blood-curdling details of how the vampire would feed and lurch out of darkness towards unsuspecting victims each evening.  

Joe felt a chill down his spine and quickly dismissed these thoughts from his mind. He felt odd having the journal in his possession, and he could only imagine what creatures and horrors the journal had belonged to 100 years prior. 

The family decided to keep the book for safe keeping, never knowing who the vampire was or what their story was. However the ancient journal in the basement of their new home would become an interesting conversation piece for them for years to come.
