 and that it was "a bit of a dream come true" to know Isobel was alive.

"In Marchbank's words I think she was a'saved one'. Isobel grew up in the area and was part of a close-knit community. She was a very supportive character and has her own family who are also well known around the area and can offer a lot of comfort…
