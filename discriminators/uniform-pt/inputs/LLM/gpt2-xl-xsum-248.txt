 the bar, made it 2-0.

The loss also extends the home side's Premier League unbeaten run to nine matches, drawing a blank in four of their last six.

But there have been signs of improvement, with Sunderland's first three league goals coming from their substitutes: Sebastian Polter and Ciaran Clark as well as Connor Wickham.

Sunderland manager Lee Johnson: "It has really been a massive win for us. On Monday at Swansea the ball seems to have got in behind pretty easily but the lads dealt with it really well today. The results show that and when you get the rewards you work for it."

Sunderland were awarded a goal-line technology review shortly before half-time, resulting in it being shown for offside.

Sunderland striker Connor Wickham: "We just need to take the positives from it. The reaction was good from the boys.

"I'm very pleased with the team and the way we carried out the game. We have showed we have got the quality to win games."

What they said:

Sunderland boss Lee Johnson: "The result, I think, says a lot about the mentality of the boys. We've shown in some of the games we have played recently that when we're playing well, we're a solid unit, we have a winning mentality and it's pleasing to get the three points today.

"We deserved a bit more than another draw but we know that when we're at our best, everyone steps up.

"The players were very professional today, there wasn't going to be any individualism or anything like that.

"The three wins were great but it's the way they have built ourselves, they have grown together. It was a pretty good performance by everyone."
