The federal government of Sao Paulo, an early proponent of dam building, has been accused of not properly consulting indigenous people downstream from the dam and then only then trying to blame dam-related deaths on climate change.

The dams have long been in controversy, coming in hot water for their impact on local populations — including a famous episode in 1991 when an alligator drowned while swimmers were at the beach.

In April 2012 a judge ruled the former Rio Gov. Joao Feliciano ordered the prosecution of five construction workers for killing six indigenous people, who are also accused of causing the destruction of about 300 tons of forest they had been guarding.

The head of a large indigenous rights association said the new decision by the federal government in São Paulo "marks a turning point" for indigenous peoples in Brazil.

The decision, she said, has no doubt been influenced by international pressure.

"The environmentalist lobby knows where we stand," said Maria do Rosario de Magalhães of Ibama, an Indigenous Peoples Association that has been leading the campaign for a fair trial and reparations for some of the dam-dammed land.

"In the past few months more than 1,000 representatives of indigenous communities were present to ask for a fair trial. Those who represent the powerful and the rich are not going to let us," she said. "They will see this as a blow to their efforts to control indigenous peoples."

Government lawyer Pedro Pardo argued that there was no evidence linking climate change or weather-related events to the dam collapse.

Government lawyers also argued that the Brazilian government has the power to revoke or suspend licences so that the country's dams can safely re-open. He did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
