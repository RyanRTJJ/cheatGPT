 after the deal has closed. The company said that it will look at taking on other renal service providers later.

Dumfries is believed to be the first "community-owned" operation to be involved in developing a new kind of renal facility and was funded by a £3 million NHS grant. It is a step into the unknown for the NHS, whose strategy for its 5.5m NHS patients is unclear. Although the NHS insists it was well received by kidney patients, there have been growing calls from doctors and politicians for the service to be scaled back to save money and ensure quality of care is not sacrificed in the process of cutting spending.

Cresswell is the only existing renal intensive care unit in Scotland, although the Department of Health is launching the development of five new centres by the end of the year.

The Dumfries facility is part of a £100m, 14-year programme to rejuvenate the NHS kidney supply in the south east and the west of England and expand specialist services.

Paul Williams of the Cresswell Association said: "Dumfries kidney service is a landmark development as a community-owned and community-led facility, and is a valuable asset to the local community.

"The decision will improve quality of life for hundreds of local people with serious kidney failure, providing a much-needed injection of vital government cash into a health service already struggling on the margins.

"Cresswell is a perfect fit for this unique facility and has developed an outstanding team and a highly-regarded facility in which the people of Dumfries are so passionate about.

"Dumfries should be congratulated for this project as it provides an opportunity to help some of the country's most vulnerable citizens."

The contract, drawn up by the consultancy firm GDF Suez, was awarded to the Dumfries unit from a shortlist of five bidders. It was one of 10 potential candidates. The other five were in Wales, the West Midlands and the South West.

David Woodhouse, regional director for England and Wales at GDF Suez, said: "The Dumfries partnership is a real testament to the high quality of care and commitment provided by the local community and the local communities
