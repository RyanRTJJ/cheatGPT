Her son and Australian businessman Geoff Johnson said his mother wanted to make the trip to Australia because she saw it as a means to continue travelling on the world stage during her waning years.

Her body was found only 20 minutes later with her hat and shoes still in her hand.

The plane and both bodies were recovered from the sea, where it is believed they crashed into the river to avoid being spotted by Allied troops.

"My mother had seen war up close and knew what was at stake," Mr Johnson said. "A lot of these ladies, the ones that survived, could find it hard to go on again but she could."

Mr Johnson said his mother would have found the trip easy as she had "no fears, she was prepared to go anywhere".

"It was her final wish to go to Australia because she saw it as a way to do that later on when she was in her later years."

Mr Johnson said she was delighted to have been chosen to travel together with the first person who died on their Titanic journey.

Mr Johnson's mother was on the Titanic from the bridge and helped steer the ship to the doomed journey on 20 April 1912.

Despite her age and poor health, he said she was "the best-looking woman I ever knew".

"She would definitely have seen something, some of the terrible things that actually took place in that night, including some of the drowning. Her eyes would have been wide open."

Her last request was that her luggage stayed where it was - but "we were already taking it back to the States to be handed over to the undertaker".
