 of 'evidence', to be disposed of within a month or so.

'I will be sending the case over to the coroner,' he said, 'I have decided the police were wrong not to disclose her injuries in writing, even in a letter that had previously been sent to all the family as warning they could be seen as unprofessional.

'The coroner may well rule out a suicide ruling and will see that it is seen as a genuine accident or a case of homicide.

'At the same time I would like to make my feelings well known that my daughter did not do this out of self-defence.

'My daughter, I am certain, did this alone.

'She knew she might become the subject of a media circus and have to relive it for eternity.

'This is not the way in which I want to see her remembered.

'This is the same attitude of people who would be on a first date, only to find themselves being held at gunpoint by the victim's fianc√©e, a burglar or a mugger.'

A police source said officers investigating the death had not been sent any paperwork of Lauren Eley's injuries, but had instead been given a collection of items which were to be kept for a future inquiry.

The statement read: 'She said the police arrived at the house after 10pm and it was clear that there was no evidence to suggest these people were involved in the death.

'Her parents went to the police station and spoke to the officers who conducted the investigation.

'We have given the family a note which explains our actions and we have also spoken to the hospital who treated her.

'The letter has not been sent by Northamptonshire Police.

'We are unable to comment further on an ongoing investigation at this stage other than to say that we will have a report within a few weeks which will be sent to our coroner, who is investigating these complex and sensitive matters.'

A post-mortem examination on Lauren was inconclusive, and was ordered at Chester's John Radcliffe hospital.
