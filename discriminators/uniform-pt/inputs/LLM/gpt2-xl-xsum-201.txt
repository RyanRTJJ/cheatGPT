 immigration ban can sue, it should be able to consider those that were. A three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the ban last week.

The government has said the ban will be challenged on several fronts. The administration will ask for a nationwide reinstatement of the ban. It may also seek to extend the ban to other countries. If that fails, Washington state will ask the court for a permanent injunction.

A ruling on that appeal is not expected until next spring or early summer. That's a break from the summer of 2017, when the administration said the ban would be in place in 90 days.

In response to the 9th Circuit's earlier order, the Trump administration filed a complaint Wednesday evening asking the Supreme Court to keep the ban in effect; Trump's Justice Department said an immediate reinstatement is necessary for public safety concerns.

"Given those public safety concerns, the government asks this Court to stay today's decision while the appeal of the government's motion is pending," the Justice Department said in a filing Wednesday night. "The government's reliance on those interests here is unwarranted. As Justice Kennedy's opinion makes clear, there is no emergency or heightened public danger to warrant such a suspension in the face of clear evidence of alien smuggling and abuse."

The administration's request did not say what it will do once the appeals court finishes its review.

The state of Hawaii, which sued alongside Washington and Minnesota, wrote in its filing Wednesday that such a stay could "further increase the risks of chaos and suffering" while the ban is in place.

"A stay would be particularly detrimental to Hawaii residents and international travelers, who would be stranded, in part, as a result of President Trump's ban. Our entire tourism industry would suffer as a result of this ban," Hawaii said. "If the ban ultimately is ultimately allowed to stand, Hawaii will be forced to lose the expertise and investment its foreign visitors and residents have provided."
