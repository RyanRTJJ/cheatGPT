 6% as a result, reflecting the increased number of customers in areas where they are available.

However, there was a 10% fall in the number of people visiting toy shops.

Sandra Wright, retail analyst at Nielsen, said ice creams remained popular and were enjoying increased pre-Christmas promotion around Christmas and Easter.

She added ice creams had become a "fashionable product". "Ice cream was a fairly new product for retailers to introduce during the 90s, but now is considered to be a popular purchase, particularly with girls," she said.

Ice cream manufacturer Dairy Farmers said earlier this year it was "disappointed" by the sales decline. However, company officials said they would work with retailers and consumers to ensure more sales next year.

Dairy Farmers has said it expects to sell 1.2 billion packets of its Ice Cream Cakes this year, double the amount sold in 2006.

The industry's consumer division chief Dave Gee said the decline in sales was "disappointing".

He added: "Our consumers are very interested in our brands and are spending money on the best ice cream, with an increasing variety in the market. We are working with our retailers, who are seeing a growing interest in these products, to get them out to our customers in a range of packaging."

Ice cream sales grew in many markets. In France, sales rose over 12%, while in the UK they were up by nearly 8% in the five months to June, compared with the same period last year.

Ice cream's popularity is increasing around Europe as the continent tries to cut back on its use of fuel.

In the UK, the EU is imposing new rules for energy inefficient buildings. It will introduce new rules by the end of 2010, which aim to increase the amount of energy used by homes, where heating and lighting was not previously in use, by five%.
