enta recently acquiring Monsanto as well.

The company's stock was down 1.5 percent to $80.93 in early afternoon trading.

Monsanto is the world's largest seed company, with annual revenue of $36 billion and a portfolio valued at $55 billion, according to its latest annual filing. Monsanto made its first foray to seed with the domesticated corn it created in 1902 called "Zea mays".

But Monsanto also is a leader in the biotech sector and for years has been a market leader in agricultural biotechnology, which uses plants and techniques, such as genetic modification, to improve agriculture.

It has a long history of suing farmers for infringing on patents on patented seeds, suing around 8,000 farmers for damages since 1996, in some cases wiping out entire families' wealth.

Seeds are the main source of food production in the country, accounting for 90 percent of consumed foodstuffs. India has been facing a number of food price spikes and riots in recent years.

Monsanto has also been the target of anti-GMO activist groups in the United States with some of their most successful campaigns being to force the company to withdraw genetically modified corn from food products.

It had spent US$1.4 billion on legal actions since 2010, according to data compiled by Washington D.C-based Public Citizen.

The Monsanto board had also approved the merger by the time of its approval Wednesday, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The acquisition values the company at around $66.8 billion based on Monsanto's stock price before Wednesday's offer filing.

Monsanto has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years over allegations of toxic chemicals used in its seeds and herbicides. The move to consolidate comes at a time when Monsanto is in the throes of litigation with the United Farm Workers Union over whether to settle a proposed multibillion-dollar legal claim brought on behalf of more than 825,000 U.S. non-union employees, as Reuters reported earlier this month.
