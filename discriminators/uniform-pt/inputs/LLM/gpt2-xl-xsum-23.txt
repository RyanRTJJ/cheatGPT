The union is calling on Northern Ireland's eight largest electricity suppliers to join in taking the price to a 10% discount.

It will lead to a cost savings of as much as €700m with the combined saving equivalent to around 15% of annual consumption.

The move will come into effect from 1 April. It takes effect just over a week before the Easter weekend, when people on many rural electricity tariffs will be switching to cheaper electricity.

The union is calling on the eight suppliers to join the cut on behalf of their customers. If they do not agree to participate, they will be liable to pay the costs for any consumers who choose to switch off by switching off the electricity, says Gerry Quinn of TUI Power and Energy.

The union said the move would be an "absolute game changer" for people who currently pay the highest electricity bills. It believes that a 10% discount will mean households will save €120 for a typical three-year cycle.

"This is a real opportunity for customers who are just starting off in the market to save," Mr Quinn said.

"This reduction in the price of power is particularly important for customers who are on contracts which have variable tariffs. Many of these customers do not have the option of switching off and this would mean that they are paying more for basic bills," he said.

The union said some small businesses, who are paying over €100 a year on electricity, would be saved by switching off. They will save around €5 a year through switching off.

The company said its current prices are competitive with the UK and Europe.

But, it is not cutting prices by 8%, as announced last year, because new contracts have come into force this year. These new, more aggressive contracts have a maximum price, and take into account the impact on the cost base. This does however mean that those on smaller rates are more likely to be affected by the price reductions, they said.

TUI Power and Energy said the cuts would save some customers between €100 and €300 a
