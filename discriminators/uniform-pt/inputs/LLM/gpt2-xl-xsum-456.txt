 of 120 runs. The wicketkeeper-batsman, however, claimed a couple of wickets as Worcestershire's batsmen were caught out short of the milestone.


Heading into the second Test, the ODI team is likely to be unchanged, with all four seamers in the team to continue to be Ben Foakes, Chris Woakes, Adam Lyth and Jonny Bairstow.

After finishing atop Group B, England face a new challenge against the world's No 1 ranked side, Australia, who hold a two-over advantage going into the second Test of the World T20.


England will get their first taste of Test match cricket for this series after facing Pakistan in the UAE in June last year.
