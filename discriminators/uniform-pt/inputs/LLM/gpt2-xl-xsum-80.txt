 an Indian, Gandhi, would take place last week. There are, however, a number of outstanding historic figures from India and the Indian diaspora, Mr Carney said.

"If I had a choice of an ethnic group to represent in the House, I'd choose to represent the UK's minorities," he said.

"There are an amazing number of people around Britain and India from different communities. The House of Commons should reflect this diversity and encourage people to speak their languages, traditions and cultures â€“ and when they do, the representatives of their constituents should reflect this and their own communities. This goes to the heart of the way in which we run our democratic institutions. I will not hesitate to speak the language of my constituents."

Asked if he was aware that it could lead to some individuals leaving the Lords due to fears that their race or ethnic background could affect their chances of being elected, Mr Carney said: "It's in everyone's interests to reflect the fullness of a community's diversity."

The House of Lords is governed by an "equalities" code, which says that "all persons who are invited to give evidence during the course of proceedings shall, in attendance, reflect the community character of its members with a view to producing an accurate and representative representation" of the whole house.
