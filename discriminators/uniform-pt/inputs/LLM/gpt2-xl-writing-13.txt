________________________________________ I didn't think you'd be able to do this, but after you put that pen to paper with the words "my first marriage", I was surprised. Maybe you were like "I want something romantic, I want a new life. I don't want to die". I really don't think I would understand you. Now I've read that a lot of people find their first marriage romantic. Now that I get it, I can get it. And in a way, that's pretty common. I've talked to a couple of women who met during the '60s.

No matter how you change, there is always going to be the person you love most and you will still be a failure. After that couple of months, there will be one more week to a year. And then you know, you might meet someone else and be like "now it's our turn!" And then they might not stop being their husband and you will still be a failure. All right.

You can tell me stories about your first marriage. That was the beginning of my first marriage. I remember my first moment of peace was
