 of taking over, he had already approached Boro to talk about a possible move for his player, adding, "I can't wait to get him to the Premier League and get him in there straight away."

"The manager has told me I can become a mainstay for the club and to have the possibility to score goals and really help the team," said Boro defender Scott Carson. "He's said he'll help me in whatever way he can and is going to do all he can to keep me here. If we're able to sign him now that'd be great if we can."

In recent weeks there have been links linking the 29-year-old with a move to Aston Villa, but Boro have not registered any interest. Moniz added: "If this opportunity comes up for Jota I'll tell him it's an unbelievable opportunity and I wish him and Rangers the best."

Boro boss Gary Rowett told the club's official website that it would be a "big shame" if Boro missed out on the Colombian attacker. After being offered to Boro, Moniz will be flying out on Thursday to meet up with his new squad, ahead of the friendly match against the Hoops in Perth.

Moniz has previously confirmed that he was impressed with the quality of the players at his former club, who he claims are "better than anybody" he has encountered during his footballing life. The former Spain international was also heavily involved with the development of Colombian football and has won league titles with Real Valladolid and Deportivo Cali.

Moniz joined Rangers in 2012 from Deportivo Cali, and helped his new bosses to promotion following three years of last season in the Championship. He scored his first goal for the iPro club, a late equaliser for their 2-2 draw at Huddersfield in April, his second of the campaign.
