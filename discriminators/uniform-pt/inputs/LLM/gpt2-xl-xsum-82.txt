 away from the band when the 'Nme Night 2' music video was scrapped – despite having written the song in the first place.

RENI HANDS ON EMI LABEL

Yesterday, it emerged that the British record label had applied to trademark the name 'Anicon'. Yesterday's news prompted the Anicon band to issue a statement saying 'Emaro' is not in any way related to the band.

"The name Anicon refers to the concept "the image on the coin", which is the most generic element of any country's currency," the statement said.

Last night, 'The Big Four' announced a charity auction entitled "Crowdfunding For A Cause – #EmaroCrowdfunding".

"Join us on Saturday (5rd April) 14th April (12pm est), 13th April (7pm est) 15th April and Tuesday (7th June) 21st June for some exciting events and exciting prizes, including our very own copy of the first Anicon album 'Ani-Crowdfunding' and a pair of our special limited edition Ani-Crowdfunding limited edition t-shirt," the auction description read.

You can bid as part of the official Big Four event over on eBay. It doesn't yet have a winning bid, but this page is currently live. There have been around three bids at £7.00.

We've reached out to the Big Four's management and to singer 'Emaro' to find out more about the auction.
