 has a couple of serious injuries behind the scenes."

Smith said he's looking forward to playing at the London Games. "I'm definitely looking forward to it, it should be a great, great atmosphere, that's the main thing.

"It's something you work for and try to achieve, but I'm over the moon at the idea of playing in my first Olympics. It's a very special event."

He has been a regular during Wimbledon's run to the semi-finals, but he has yet to find winning form at the Olympics.

Smith started the year well with a 4-3, 6-4, 6-1 win over Mark Selby on the first day. When he beat Andy Roddick on day three, it sparked a 12 round winning streak, which was ended by a 5-4 loss to Rafael Nadal on the same day. He lost the final against the Spaniard by the equivalent of less than one set.

His form has picked up slightly but he still hasn't found his stroke to beat the top players. However, given he only needs one set to win in the first round, he is more than capable of reaching the grand slam final. The player at the centre of the controversy after beating Nadal, Andy Roddick, was the last British man to win a grand slam.

One of the great stories at the 2008 Beijing games was that of Andrew Smith's wife, Angela. She has a rare brain disorder that left her a paraplegic while she was in hospital after being injured in a fall. If she had been more lucky, she may very well have made it to the closing ceremony with the rest of her husband's team. She is now a paraplegic too after suffering a stroke.

Smith said: "There's been many highs and lows in my career, including my wife getting hit by a car and the shock after her surgery. There were a couple of big events last year where I knew the medal had gone. In this era of modern sport, I really haven't expected to win medals, but I really wanted this one."

Smith was the first Briton to reach the quarter finals at the Australian Open. He has finished above Roger Federer and Novak
