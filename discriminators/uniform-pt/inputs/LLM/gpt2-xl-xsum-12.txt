However, the DUP budget is likely to raise some eyebrows in Stormont, as it will feature a number of items that have been vetoed by the unionists before.

The DUP is expected to increase spending on the police, in particular the £900,000 increase proposed for the Northern Ireland Serious Crime Intelligence and Emergency Response Team (Sio-Eirr) budget. The Sio-Eirr unit is part of the police which deals with the terrorist threat.
