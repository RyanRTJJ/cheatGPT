Last week, Michael Gove was forced to admit he had been made aware of the possible risk months after the UK joined the EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which many experts believe could include an 'emerging issues' clause that would permit Britain to ditch its obligations.

The government is preparing an announcement next week that would set out how it intends to deliver new measures to protect Britons following the European ruling. Such a move would give ministers the opportunity to explain how they are going to deal with the problem, including how the UK will ensure that new EU rules on drugs are applied to the UK market as they become law.

A House of Lords report last month raised concerns that the government's actions could be counterproductive, which would encourage the spread of bacteria resistant to antibiotics and result in public health officials having to use "a more limited range of antibiotics to treat the vast majority of patients" rather than the full range that is required.

However, the government has maintained that it is committed to keeping Britain drug-free by repealing outdated laws that require some foods to be labelled "tainted".

A draft version of the proposal sent by the Department for International Trade to the Queen's Counsel suggests that Britain could scrap its obligations on medicines, after it has left the EU.

"Following negotiations with individual member states, UK law may continue to apply to drugs purchased for use in the NHS, but we are likely to have to implement the new EU directive and its associated safeguard measure within the UK after the UK leaves the EU," it says.

In a bid to reassure public health officials that they are protected under EU rules, the draft says that "under appropriate circumstances" it could "apply to products from some countries, to other products from other countries, and/or to products imported from outside the EU".
