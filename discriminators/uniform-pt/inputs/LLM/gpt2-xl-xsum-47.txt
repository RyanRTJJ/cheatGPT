 polls as an unpopular leader, and threatened with an anti-LGBT law, he was confronted earlier today as he arrived in Canberra with his dog for a stroll in a park. A woman in a white coat, her hands covered with flowers, shouted at him, "You're an open traitor! Your dog's poo on my lawn! He's a terrorist!" This is a standard tactic of some of Australia's right-wingers (and it's a tactic Tony Abbott himself has used to great effect, against any perceived leftist political threat). But it may be the best way to convince the rest of Australia to leave Abbott alone.

Watch Abbott's full-length press conference below. The press conference went much better than this woman thought.

UPDATE 2: A commenter below points out the video had the problem of a woman asking the question which led to the moment. "Her 'dog's poop on my lawn' was a bad joke," the commenter concludes. I agree.

UPDATE 3: The Daily Mail reports on the clip's viral virality and its effect on the prime minister. It adds that the woman has now left the vicinity, and says she regrets asking the questions and has apologised.

This article has been updated with further information about Abbott's dog's poo.
