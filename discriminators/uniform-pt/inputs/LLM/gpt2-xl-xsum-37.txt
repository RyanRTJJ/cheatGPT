looking forward to meeting them at the World Cup.

"It's a big game so I am definitely looking forward to the Netherlands.

"The Dutch are a strong team, with strong characters. They have a lot of players in their squad who can score goals. We haven't got many of those in our country."

Sampson said he wants to see the same success between England and Scotland in Brazil next year, but said the squad's performance against France had been as impressive as his team's display in a 2-1 win over Slovakia.

"The English fans have loved it as if they were watching it all day. That was one of the moments when these games were the most exciting for the world and the game was most entertaining, not that we were the best players in the game, but the English got behind us all of the time.

"We are not the same as we were before the Euros."

The Lionesses have also got their own celebrations to prepare, after beating France 1-0.

"The second half was really good but the first was the better," said Sampson. "It was good for everybody to enjoy in the different ways. I think it has been a good week and that will make the preparations even more difficult.

"We were able to put in most of the training sessions as a professional team and I thought the girls did that very well."

Sampson added: "We have to win but obviously there's going to be a bit of joy, some great moments and some difficult moments.

"The boys will take care of ourselves and we know we can get over the line and make it a victory.

"We just have to put everything in perspective, look after yourselves in the right places and make sure there is no pain. We know that this is a long season against teams that are better than us and there are going to be moments of pain and upsets."
