 appear in court on 16 January. The charges follow a BBC One investigation that saw it exposed in September 2017 that £1.2bn was missing from the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and NatWest over 13 years. The investigation found that RBS and NatWest were not properly reporting millions of pounds in money coming and going from the UK's largest consumer credit company, which then helped to create a "fictitious image" of its balance sheet, the BBC was told.
