degree depraved-heart murder.

Mr Goodson was suspended on Wednesday, a day after officers had arrested him.

The department described the driver of the police van as the driver, and said the back seat passenger was a school bus driver.

"Mr Goodson was not in uniform," said a statement from the department.

Police are also searching for Officer Garrett Miller, who police say was the driver of the second car.

They said Officer Miller had been suspended from his job while the investigation continues. Neither Officer Miller nor Officer Goodson had a seatbelt on.

More than 20 members of Baltimore's black community held a rally on Tuesday to condemn the officers' involvement in Mr Gray's death.

Police say there has been a "dramatic rise" in deadly police-involved shootings in the country's latest "Ferguson Effect".

The Justice Department said in March that US police departments had "too often used excessive and deadly force to make arrests".

The American Civil Liberties Union in Maryland, which says thousands of people in Baltimore have been arrested without cause over the past year, told the BBC that the officers in the death of Mr Gray will not be charged because of the "systemic failings" in policing in the city.

However, the NAACP, which says it has sent 600 letters to the US Attorney General, has called for Officer Goodson to be charged and Mr Miller to be fired.

Earlier this week, the city's prosecutors released information about the case of a man in his mid-twenties, who is accused of stealing beer from a Baltimore pub.
