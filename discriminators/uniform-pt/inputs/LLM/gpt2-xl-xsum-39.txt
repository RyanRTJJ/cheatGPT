 the jury forewoman.

In a statement following the verdict, Ms Ollongren said: "I am still in a state of shock.

"People used to say I had a talent for trial and I never thought I would have to stand up for myself.

"I am extremely grateful to Jody. We were both going to be jury forewomen and did it for different reasons.

"Jody took me under his wing when I needed to feel better about myself."

Jody had pleaded for clemency saying his punishment was no tougher than for "a man his age".

He claimed his crime was so "out of character" it was akin to a "sudden death incident" because it happened "between his and his mother's arms".

After being asked by the court about his plans for the future, he responded: "I see the point in living a long time so I will live a good life.

"Life is short - life is short and so I will make the most out of it."

He told the court: "I have nothing to say other than this has been a very, very difficult time for me."

He said his conviction could not affect the death penalty because that was not a form of punishment that was common in the UK.

"It's been a really difficult time for me, a really difficult time for my wife and my family," he said.

After listening to the jury's verdict, it was clear that the three-to-one majority had found Jody not guilty on the first two charges of murder and not guilty on the final charge of manslaughter.

The jury rejected his version of events and found that he had been an innocent husband and father.
