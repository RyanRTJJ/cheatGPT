products are covered by an annual security audit, with more than half of that number not being reviewed annually by an independent third party, according to a 2013 report from the SANS Institute. In the past two years, more than half of heart pacemakers have been recalled due to a manufacturing defect, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

Surgical implants and heart valve devices were the most vulnerable to attack by hackers, and those attacks typically involved inserting malicious firmware into the operating systems, according to a 2014 security analysis report from a company called Symantec. That report is the first to show hackers targeting specific types of medical devices with the ability to exploit a specific set of vulnerabilities, called zero-day exploits.

The hacks generally used vulnerabilities on the way a medical device communicates with a hospital or doctor to carry out its function. The implants—a pacemaker, for example—could be hacked without a patient's knowledge. If there is a problem with the pacemaker, it could communicate through wires to the hospital that will have to be severed. If the implanter is working properly and the doctor has ordered an incorrect length wire, a hacker could turn it into a deadly weapon that could kill patients. In short, many of these medical devices are so critical, doctors should consider their survival paramount, said Dr. Andrew Schulte, an emergency physician and researcher at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio who previously worked on medical device security issues.

Schulte was part of an investigative team that found a cyberattack against an orthopedic implants manufacturer in 2005. He said hacks against systems in critical medical devices are all too easy to spot—especially now that the security industry has focused more on the vulnerabilities and how to fix them: "If you want to do something on your own time, you can just find a vulnerability and implement your own patch within 45 minutes."

Security analysts point to several factors that make security in medical devices difficult to find and fix: The proliferation of systems in hospitals and clinics makes it difficult for them to monitor all their systems or verify that they have been properly updated. As people tend to trust these devices, making sure it hasn't been hacked is more a matter of not looking
