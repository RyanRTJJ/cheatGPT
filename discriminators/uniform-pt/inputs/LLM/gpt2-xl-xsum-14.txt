 to bike to work while "riding for love" as they suffered attacks by thugs, the company has said.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the new regulations showed "we are moving in the right direction", but added that he wanted to see safer bikes, more cycling, and improved transport infrastructure as well.


Deliveroo's new rules say that when riders are not carrying passengers, they may be threatened, pushed or grabbed.

It calls upon riders to treat every passenger with "respect, courtesy and consideration".

It adds: "Your safety is the highest priority; all routes and locations are subject to active policing and risk management.

"If we are asked to stop your ride at any time, you must comply immediately with the police, and if you need the police, we will continue to provide them assistance accordingly, including by providing a liaison officer."

Khan has taken a tough stance on the issue, speaking in the wake of the acid attacks in south London. He said that the capital needed to "be a city safe in our diversity".


Last week, there were violent clashes in London after a woman wearing a hijab was chased and verbally abused on her way into work, prompting an online petition calling for the Metropolitan police to be given special powers to deal with "race hate crime".

The company also faced growing criticism over its treatment of female drivers, when it was revealed that one female driver who quit the firm was sacked after complaining about sexism in her working environments. It was also revealed at the weekend that Deliveroo had had to suspend 15 drivers in 2015 after they were charged with rape.
