Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg, located just outside the coastal town of Borth, has been at the centre of the controversy since 2007, when the council put a moratorium on demolishing the building.

The council said it was concerned about the building's contribution to community blight and was in the process of replacing it with a new site that would be more appropriate for its purpose.

She said Mr Rowlands had confirmed this during an earlier meeting.

"Our community are already living in fear because of the destruction of Bryn Estyn Castle, which was demolished as part of the local regeneration plan five years ago. It is not right that this
