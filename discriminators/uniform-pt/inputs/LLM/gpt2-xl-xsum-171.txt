The BBC will host a one-off coverage of the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the Falklands conflict next year.

The corporation will show The Return on 20 April, following former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw in his role as a special adviser for BBC2's The World at One.

It follows a two-hour special during which a team of experts assesses the significance of the events that took place on 2 April 1982, when Argentine commander Admiral Hernán Cortés led an invasion of the Falklands, which he claimed was "in defence of his country".

The Return will tell stories of those who were there - including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher herself and her ministers - to reflect on that pivotal year, and its lessons.

A separate special will bring together victims' relatives to celebrate the anniversary as well.

During the Falklands War, UK forces faced down an Argentine force, which invaded South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The conflict was the first in the British empire's Second World War against Argentine military forces.
