 who moved up from 4th in London to 5th in Rio, finished with a time of 6.73m, a substantial improvement on her 7.13s in London.

Johnson-Thompson said that after she came up against a "very strong" 6.74. "We both knew that there was a very good chance to win and we just kept pushing with everything we had.

"At the end, I felt like I was actually the fastest person." - Danyelli Yee

"It's not unusual when you're the favourite for a title. It was a really tough race for everyone and I think we've just got to find a winning formula to keep going."

The winner of Olympic 5000-meter final, Liliya Shobukhova, finished her competition on 6.85m, less than a second ahead of Ugen. Zubeidat Shustova is the winner of the 5000-meter final and is only half-a-second behind Shobukhova.

"It was really hard to stay calm. I'm really feeling fine." - Zubeidat Shustova

Shustova has previously run faster over this distance than Ugen but the Russian woman won't be able to hold onto that success once the final race is over.

"In the final she just had more potential. After the first half lap she was just a little bit ahead of me so we kept going," said Ugen. "Zubeidat is a very strong and fast runner so there is no pressure for me."

Shimotsun Shustova's win marks her first gold medal as a defending gold medalist.

"I was really proud to win," said the 25-year-old. "It was my first (gold medal). I feel really satisfied. I wanted to win more and after the last 1000m I was just having a really strong leg."

In the women's 800-metre final, Lidiya Shobukhova also secured gold after a dominant race. The 29-year-old Uzbek gold medallist was just 1.4 seconds ahead of Shobukhova and finished with a time of 1:42.63
