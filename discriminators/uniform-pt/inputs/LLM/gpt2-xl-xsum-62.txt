 boys under 12 years old were assaulted by two girls in 2013. An investigation found that the girls had used a belt to strike one of the four year olds. The same girls were found guilty of three counts of unlawful wounding but the judge was unable to sentence them because the assaults had been committed over a short period of time and they were of such a small age that they could not be held responsible for them.

It was a similar case in 2015 in Liverpool when three girls were caught abusing five young girls. One of them was 14-years-old when she was charged. The judge said that all three girls should have gone to the police together but there was a real possibility that the other two would have gone down differently in the eyes of the public.

This is why it is vital that the criminal justice system is much more open and accountable for all cases. That means bringing all cases before the courts in the same way and, where prosecutions have not been carried out, publishing the decision so people can make an informed choice.

The only way to ensure all children are safe from abuse and neglect is to prosecute abusers because they will be caught and punished when others are being protected. To see justice for all, the law needs to change. It is this way that child safety will be ensured and that women and girls can feel safe to report abuse.
