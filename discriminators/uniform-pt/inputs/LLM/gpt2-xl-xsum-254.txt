 Czajkowski, a nurse, told the local newspaper she went into the toilet because she and her daughter hadn't been able to find somewhere free from teenagers because of the busy Christmas weekend.

On Tuesday morning Kaya was "really distressed", had to be sedated in hospital, had to be sedated in hospital and it is believed it was to do with being frightened.

A friend of Nicole Czajkowski said: "Nicole was really worried about what had happened. She's actually shocked. She doesn't have mental health problems, she's just very shy, very intelligent, very intelligent.

"She's a lovely person."

The mother gave her daughter Kaya a £50 note on Sunday, along with an apology saying she would have known they were dangerous "if they had a pair of scissors".

But she was told she could keep the money.

Nicole Czajkowski told the Exeter Express and Echo: "I would like to make it clear that neither of our children had scissors, they had not done these things.

"We are still distraught over what took place. Kaya is a young child and just over the age of ten. I was never aware of her being fearful of this young boy, a young boy in the shape of this boy.

"If you want to keep a change of £50 to say sorry, give it to me. I was just horrified."

But an Essex Police spokesman added: "Police received several calls from members of the public reporting to officers that a girl was inside the restaurant.

"Officers believed there was a number of people, including children, who could have been involved in attempting to glue a McDonald's toilet seat.

"Officers established that there were two victims, a girl aged 10 and a boy aged 11. Both girls had left the toilet while the boy was using it. A female member of the public saw the boys playing on the toilet seat with the glue and called the police.
