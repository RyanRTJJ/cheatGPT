Â What happens when you try? It will be the biggest crossover story in the history of the site! If it's up to me I'll have a big crossover with the comic book "Batman and Joker" and possibly a crossover with the TV show Batman Begins. If it's not up to me I'd rather just write a Batman story set in the 2000's. Any character works just as well as the one pictured here!
One last thing...This should have been a comic, not a story...If a character seems too big and out of character just leave it and come back later! And if you think something's not working well, you can always try a bit different!
EDIT : A lot of people have asked me if a "WTF?!" ending was possible, so I thought I'd try my hand at it.
This is the first piece in a future series of "Batman and Joker Crossover Comic Stories" - if you have suggestions for them, just let me know! :D
A/N: Hope you had fun with the story! I tried my best to include humor and the typical "Batman vs. Joker" stuff but I'm sure the actual story will have some "wtf!" moments. If you didn't get everything but the core of what you wanted out my guess is that you might want to skip the comic and come back later! But you might still find this "WTF!" story interesting, so I'd recommend sticking with it. I'm a big fan of fanfic and I try my best to have the characters all have strong personalities. And I'm a pretty good story teller!
