Wukong sold bicycles for as little as 500 yuan last year, but has become a darling among young Chinese buyers - partly boosted by a high-profile publicity blitz led by founder Wang Lei and his daughter Wanda - because of a reputation for stylish styling.

The company has introduced several new models since the start of the year, including a lightweight trike with five-speed transmission and a more conventional model with a three-speed.

"We are still in the process of evaluating our sales volumes and will continue to take proper measures to support this effort," chief executive Sun Xiangzhong told reporters on Wednesday.

FIVE-STICKED GEAR

The company said Wukong had sold more than 20,000 bikes so far this year, up from around 10,000 sold a year earlier.

But Wang said the company needed more time to confirm its sales figures and the company faced difficulty to reach consumers and distributors in remote areas, mainly in central China.

Wang said the company had developed a "five-sticked" gear ratio to address the problem and it was considering whether to adopt it with all its products.

Wang's Wenzhou Bicycles Co Ltd (7016.HK) said it had introduced a new two-wheeler model called the WZ-9000 and was already selling more than 500 more bikes a day compared to a year earlier. The company added it was considering introducing a larger three-wheeler that could reach speeds of up to 45 km per hour.

WZ also launched a high-tech electric bike in December that features a 3D-printed aluminum frame with a metal gear lever, a detachable handphone, Bluetooth headset and a small LED light on the back.

Wang's WZ said its sales topped 10 million bikes in 2016 and it hoped to make it 20 million next year.
