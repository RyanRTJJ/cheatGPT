 performing surgical procedures on the head, neck and chest which would be considered suicide or self-harm and so could have driven up hospital deaths. Now we see that figures for an even more serious scenario – those of consultants performing heart procedures.

And yet the number of heart surgeries has been falling:

• In June the number of heart surgeries was 595 up from 491 in March. The overall decline is in line with the trend in all-cause deaths.

• In June the mortality rate for heart failure was 4.7 per 1,000 patients. This is significantly lower than the average of 6.5 in the 12 months to March.

• In June there was an increase in the proportion of all patients aged 80 years and over who died in hospital from 14.5% in May to 15.1% in June.

The news is grim. And it's not just heart failure. Figures from December show that the number of major knee operations had fallen by 9%, but again the fall was in line with overall falls and not in line with a fall for major procedures. It is only as the figures were compiled that the authors knew the reasons behind the fall.

As in other areas of surgery, there needs to be a balance between risks and benefits. The authors write that there is an overall "risk of harm" associated with operating. The benefit comes from the fact that most patients are not serious heart failure sufferers, so the overall numbers fall.

But the most disturbing aspect to this news is how this relates to the Government's efforts to reduce deaths in hospital. The coalition's Health and Social Care Bill sets out a new duty for hospitals to do one risk-free operation a year. The Bill is not based on an individual case. But it was written with the aim of reducing complications when doing major surgical procedures, and that is where the need for more risk managers comes in. It is important that the health service encourages people who are going to be ill to come in, so that the
