It may surprise you that the Sochi opening ceremony featured a song (featuring the British composer Philip Glass and the Russian soloist Vadim Petrov) about a snowman falling in love with another snowman. No one at Sochi even really knew who Petrov was, with his lyrics that are about being born and coming out as gay. I've heard it's a nice story.


My second question is about the US Supreme Court ruling â€“ why is it that some countries can have gay marriages or have gay adoption (Sweden has done both) and others can't?


Last question: Why has the US made gay marriage legal for same-sex couples and not for heterosexual couples, as it is for everyone else?
