ing and unnecessary congestion", but that the city council was also looking at "designating specific streets as night time zones."

City Councillor Peter Hume spoke against the motion to the council and agreed that more could be done, but was not on board with the "all of the above" approach. Meanwhile, Councilman Chris Flanders said more research should be done into fire hazard. "The best way to prevent future fires is to have fires stop," he said.

Hume suggested that the city should work with the fire marshal to develop street closures during Bonfire night.

Flanders, however, said the mayor's office is open to working with the fire department on the issue. "The mayor has said he wants something done now," he said. "Hopefully this will get done earlier than later."

Councillor Joe McKendry said he would vote for a motion put forth by Coun. Steve Kanellakos seeking to make Bonfire night an annual event.

He agreed with Kanellakos that there should be a change "from one of many," but wouldn't put a number on how many.

McKendry said he would not take a position on the rest of the "all of the above" motion, but believes there should be more discussion to identify the best possible solution.

Kanellakos said that the city did not want to make sweeping decisions without a process in place.

"It is not about saying this is the most effective way, or the safest way," he said. "It is about identifying the best options."

Councillor Frank Scarpitti expressed opposition to the idea of a street closure, and noted that the streets on which fire marshals will be responsible were not included in the discussion. He suggested that the city look at the possibility of adding more or more crews to its fleet to handle fire and police calls.

"I will go to bed at night," said councilor Chris Gibson. "And I feel I'm doing that now, I'll be thinking about what the next day will look like."

Council members, however, were not in a mood to discuss their plans for the future, and only spoke about their frustration at the events
