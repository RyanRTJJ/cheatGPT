The first stage of the government's blueprint, which provides policy goals, measures and targets, is laid out in a 50-page document. It sets out the government's aims for the first three years.

The Scottish government would invest in skills and training: "Our schools would be able to provide high-quality, lifelong education to all of our children"

Scotland would maintain the Common Agricultural Policy and would "further strengthen" its commitment to Scotland's food and drink producers and the Scottish food sector
