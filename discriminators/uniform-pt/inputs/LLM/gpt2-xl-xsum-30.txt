if hydro stations are not brought online as power demand increases during the summer months.

The company said in a statement it will "fully utilise" the existing facilities, using an approach that will allow Scotland's transmission system to "fully balance generation by bringing generation from other sources on-line at the appropriate time in order to ensure sufficient transmission capacity".

As such, Scottish households will not notice the loss of reliability, because of its ability to fill all capacity as needed.

The firm also said it has been in discussions with the Ministry of Defense to ensure the new facility will operate safely and without conflict with its other units.

"We have had this conversation on technical systems and technology, but have not had this conversation on any human-rights issues," said a spokesperson. "Clearly the fact that we have in place measures in terms of human rights in relation to our operations in Syria speaks volumes about the company's commitment to these types of issues."

A Government spokeswoman said the review concluded that Scotland's national grid was able to accommodate new generation and that no additional transmission lines were required.

"It's now possible to ensure that this gas-fired generator is able to take on 100% of Scotland's electricity demand in the summer," said a Cabinet Office spokeswoman. "That's something the Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, David Mundell, has been raising for some weeks."

In 2012, Scottish Government Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said there were no plans to use gas-fired plants in future because of concerns about safety.

However, Mundell, on a visit to the United States last week, said: "The Minister has been making it clear that we want to ensure that we make sure that we get new generation in Scotland to complement those already being used by Scottish households and businesses to meet the growing demand for energy that we have seen, both in Scotland and throughout the UK."

A further review is currently under way in England.

The new plant is expected to cost
