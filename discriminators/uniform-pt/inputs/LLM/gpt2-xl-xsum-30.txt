udi Gaudry said: "She was in bed with her family when the police came looking for her.

"From what little we know, she was attacked by a group of men who were going around the town trying to cause fear."

The mother of the child told the BBC: "Two older brothers came along and said 'that's what happens when you let your kids run wild'.

"When the older boys took the little girl outside they went off at full speed - something must have scared the little girl, when they had nowhere to go and couldn't stop. It's all very hard at the moment," she added.

'He was like a ghost'

Police have appealed for witnesses to CCTV images of the men they are trying to identify, who they believe are about 20-25 years old.

Supt Mark Purnell said: "We think it might be a group of men, and we are appealing to people to see some images and help us to identify those responsible.

"We are speaking with a young woman who is the aunt of the girl, and she has given us her version of events."

The girl was reported missing after she was last seen leaving her home in Leicestershire at around 10:00 BST on 13 November.

Her friend said she took her sister Lola to spend the night at a neighbour's home.

She told BBC News: "[The girl] went inside the house, and when she came out about 10pm she went into the street and said to her sister they had to come back and get her."

Her friend said the girl was a "very quiet" girl who had a "kind, loving" personality.

The aunt of the victim posted on Facebook: "My granddaughter has just had her birthday and she looked so excited she was almost bursting into tears.

"Her face was so bright and full of life.

"I just can't believe she is gone and now nothing has been done. She was like a ghost, full figure, laughing and joking
