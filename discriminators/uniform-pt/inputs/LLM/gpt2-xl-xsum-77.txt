, the union's general secretary, said: "We've seen how difficult it's been for teachers to get a decent pay deal and that's not getting any better. A pay deal alone won't solve this problem."

The union says the average workload of teachers in Northern Ireland – 38 hours a week – is already the second highest in the UK, after New Zealand, and more than twice the recommended level. It says the problem is worse at local authority schools, where teachers also work longer hours.

In June, the Northern Ireland assembly rejected a demand from the national education union, the EIS, that teachers be allowed a six-day week. In a separate development, an employment tribunal has ordered the EIS to pay a former teacher in Belfast £60,000 after she claimed her contract was "illegal and unlawful" because it was agreed without a collective agreement among the union's members.

A spokesman for the EIS said it would "reserve comment while we consider what further steps we might need to take". The NASUWT said: "We are extremely disappointed our teachers won't get collective agreement on pay, due process and workload at a time when teacher workloads across the UK are at their lowest since 2008."

A NI cabinet spokesperson said: "We believe we are the right partner for schools and parents, through education, training and employment opportunities."

The government claims unions play a "very destructive role" in holding the education system to ransom. This week, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there needs to be greater transparency about the funding deals of schools, making it easier for the sector to set up independent bodies.

Northern Ireland's deputy education secretary, Louise Segalen, has told delegates at Teachers Monthly this month that it is working to ensure schools are paid a "fair share of the UK total". She said it is "fair to assume [Northern Ireland schools] receive less than UK schools" due to differences in pay across the UK. In 2011-12, NI schools received an average of €7.8m from central government
