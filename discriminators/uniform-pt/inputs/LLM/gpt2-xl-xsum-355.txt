 "overabundance" of children in the state's schools, with too many of them falling behind at secondary school. It's a complex argument, and it's one that will take years to resolve. But for now the verdict is pretty damning.

Sir Michael is very careful to note that some schools are doing better than others, and that he wants to see the best schools improve. But in some sense the chief inspector has done the job for them, because, as he says, "the failure of our local authority's and schools' ability to get hold of all pupils has meant that the number of the worst performing schools in our state academy sector as a whole is now even higher than it was when Ofsted reported."

The report is the culmination of a review last year into London's multi-academy trusts. In it, Sir Michael was asked what had gone wrong. His answer may well have been the one that made headlines. (Perhaps it did.) When he was asked what had gone wrong in the multi-academy system, his answer was remarkably sober and evenhanded. "There is a lot of bad news," he told the inquiry. "No one of these organisations would have passed if it had been an exam without the other aspects."

Which elements?

We've been told the key elements of the Ofsted report are that there was an "overabundance" of children in the schools, that there were not enough governors, and that the schools were not "giving enough advice on the most efficient ways of recruiting new staff and developing successful apprenticeships".

The question now is, does all of this add up to a systemic, systemic problem, with a systemic solution? Does Britain need a government overhaul? Or would that just make things worse?

You'll notice I haven't said that things have reached some catastrophic level. The last thing we need right now is a government overhaul. If schools can't hire enough governors because Ofsted aren't giving them enough advice on how to hire more, then that might help. But I'm not sure that this would be the remedy.

For one thing, a great deal of
