 It is something I wish were more easily accessible, and that is something I hope to change. What I like to do is take photos, then try my hand at something more interesting with the resulting product – in my case I would put it into a painting.

Here is one version of my portrait project with one of my favourite paintings:

I have been using a digital camera to take the images for this project, and have tried to make my style as simple as possible, keeping the subject in focus the whole time so is hopefully consistent from photo to photo. It's not a one-way street – this is purely about me taking photos and painting, with the idea being that each one will inspire me to push myself further as I paint, even if the photo is a 'failure' (or something I would rather have not taken). I find that looking at my photos with other people can be a very enjoyable pastime and I hope that for this project and for future ones, it can bring people along with me.

There is also a video on Youtube that I wish to share, showing the process through a conversation with my partner Ben:

The more I think about it, the more I want to give back. Photography is incredibly subjective and often we see things only through our own eyes, so what I find is that I love doing portraits when I work with a partner. It doesn't matter if I'm doing the whole painting or just my arm, as long as the other person helps shape the image. And of course, the last minute is the best time to do these. Sometimes you just want it done and no time is available after the picture is taken. The main reason why I love this activity is also because it's the one time I can do something that I believe will have an impact
