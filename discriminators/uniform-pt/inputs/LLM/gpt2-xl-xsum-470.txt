 a "cavalier attitude".

The petition states: "When Ms Walsh's actions were disclosed in late February of this year, it was decided that she would no longer be attending college in September. Given her history of abusive comments, we believe this is an appropriate decision.

"The circumstances make it clear that Ms Walsh is not fit to remain a member of staff at GCNC, given the nature of the abuse she has directed at another student and the general climate of the college in question. In light of this and her attitude to both the media, the Scottish Government and other Scottish universities, it is not justifiable for her to continue to attend classes."

The petition adds: "This is an unacceptable and cavalier attitude towards a student who was in genuine fear for her safety, and who took an extraordinary risk to try and expose and correct a situation which was causing her further harm.

"Ms Walsh's subsequent dismissal was totally unnecessary. There is clearly a case for a quick conclusion to this matter, however, it would appear that the College has no respect for the welfare of its staff, nor does it seem to have the will to properly consider and apply its own disciplinary procedures."

Another petition, set up by the NUS Scotland Campaign Against Racism in Higher Education, suggests some students are now suffering from PTSD after years of abuse from Walsh.

The petition states: "Despite the long history of racist comments and abuse directed at Glasgow University students, Glasgow Clyde College and other colleges and universities in Scotland, they did not take such threats seriously.

"Ms Walsh made it clear that if students complained, they would be 'in trouble' and would therefore be suspended, with the university's agreement. Such comments and actions have now been used as a form of intimidation against students of colour on campus."

The National Union of Students Scotland (NUS) said Ms Walsh's views held no place on Scottish campuses.

A statement from the union said: "It is unacceptable for such an individual with such clear views, to be an official in an institution of higher education and further training for working adults.

"The position we have been notified of is deeply concerning and is in the broader context of issues of racism and discrimination in higher education.
