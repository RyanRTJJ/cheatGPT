 NHS and the arts after that.

The verdict: No. The pledge has a very specific timeline. Under its current funding, which runs until 2020, the UK has to continue to contribute to the EU budget for four years longer than it has in previous years. It also guarantees that spending rises by at least 2% a year beyond 2020. If that does not happen, the UK pays 3% a year until 2020. If the UK voted for Brexit on 23 June, that 3% would not rise for six years. But that 3% would increase by 2% a year thereafter. That means no guarantee from the UK that it could use the funds that are due to be spent after 2020. That spending would have to come out of the EU budget.

It is clear that a government would not be allowed to use its annual budget to fund something that takes seven years to be received. After that, it would be the responsibility of the EU to give it back because the UK would no longer be paying towards it.

For that reason, any spending commitments from 2019 – when the UK leaves the EU – have to be agreed with the Commission, not the parliament.

If the UK voted to leave during this period, it would not necessarily mean that future UK governments had to hand back the money, because future governments can ask for it back, or just give it back to the EU. The European Parliament would have to agree to it.

But if at the end of that period of five years, the UK has left the EU, then any money the EU does not give back to the UK will have to be spent or collected through the EU budget, in full.

This means, for example, that if Britain had voted to keep the spending commitments of, say, 2013, 2019 onwards, but then voted to leave, that money would have been spent in full, because this would be a "return to the EU budget". It would not have gone to the government as a gift.

The claim: "By 2019/2020, the UK will have left the European Union and will be able to choose its own immigration system."

The verdict: Vote Leave said the government's plans were "reversing the clock"
