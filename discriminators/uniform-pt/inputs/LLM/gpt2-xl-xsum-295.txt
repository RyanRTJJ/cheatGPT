,500 new trees have been added along a new road in north Derry.

The team also carried out two major road construction projects in the NUS area. The first completed in September 2016 saw the installation of new pavement on the A1 between Armagh College and Ardoyne. Further works have been implemented at the junction north of Ardoyne between October and November that will also provide extra kerbs along the approach road to the A1. In the last quarter of 2016 a further Â£20,000 has been spent upgrading the bridge as more roadwork is carried out in the area.

The team also continued their maintenance activities along the Armagh Road, by removing overgrown vegetation and repairing and building new drainage and culverts.

Projects carried out by the Engineering Team include:

The construction of a brand new footpath.

Installation of a new pedestrian and cycle bridge over the Armagh Bridge to replace a water main and culvert.

Installation of five new bays, a new footpath and overgrown vegetation

Installation of a section of new pavement at the Ardoyne junction

Installation of a bus shelter

Replacement of two culverts at the junction of Ardoyne and Armagh

Construction of four footpath bridges over Armagh and Armagh Road, providing improved access to Ardoyne and North Belfast.

In February 2017 the team completed a major project along the Armagh Road extending a new pedestrian and bike bridge over the Armagh Bridge. Three new bays were created and one new footbridge at the old junction was added along with landscaping to make a more pleasant working environment for drivers and cyclists.

Further work has been carried out at the junction north of Ardoyne between October and November this year where a footpath bridge has been constructed at one end providing improved access to St Michael's School and a cycle bridge at the junction with North Street provides cyclists a direct route through west Ardoyne to North Belfast.

The roadwork programme has been extended as the team continues to carry out an expansion of the A1 area in Derry and an extension of the Northern Quarter to the A1.

In the same period work has continued to remove overgrown vegetation near the existing railway
