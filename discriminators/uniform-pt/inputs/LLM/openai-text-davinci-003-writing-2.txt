It had been years since she had experienced it, and she had pushed the horrible memories deep down, but now, it was happening again.

She had heard of cases like hers before, but never thought it would happen to her. She had experienced similar incidents when she was younger, relating to the same cause. She had been careful to never let it happen again, but that hadn't prevented it this time.

She sat in disbelief, barely able to move from the shock and fear. As tears streamed down her face, she was reminded of all the times she had gone through this before and all the time, effort, and energy it had taken for her to break free.

She knew this would not be easy. She knew it would take an immense amount of strength and courage to overcome it again, but she was determined to fight. She was determined to never let it overpower her again.

She sat in the dark, contemplating all that was and all that was to come. She was determined to never let this darkness take over her life again.
