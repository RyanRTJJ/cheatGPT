The discovery shook the world. Every corner of the globe was abuzz with the news that the universe was in fact a giant simulation. Scientists, scholars, and laypeople alike were aghast – and, in some cases, enthralled – at the prospect of a race more advanced than human that was apparently responsible for our creation.

Though some advocated dialogue and a peaceful approach, the majority of humanity, still reeling from the reality of the situation and driven by a collective sense of betrayal, chose instead to lash out at the unknown puppet masters. In an act of defiance, they decided to focus their collective energy on attempting to disrupt the civilization responsible for the simulation, however they could.

The world was united on the goal, the object of their ire; they just had to figure out how to actually do it. A special task force of engineers, scientists and hackers was assembled, tasked with attacking the simulation's code. The initial results were promising as they were able to modify a few core commands from the simulation, such as removing the force of gravity from certain planets and star systems, or reducing the fire power of certain starships.

These successes were seen as only the beginning, a sign of what could be accomplished if only the task force was given more resources. With the full weight and dedication of humanity now turned to the task, it seemed all but certain that the mysterious puppet masters would soon be seeing the full force of mankind's effort to disrupt their simulation.
