 number of unions are calling for the Bill to be withdrawn entirely.

MEP Richard Howitt said the Bill was an attack on the working time standards in Scotland, the rest of the UK, Wales and Northern Ireland.

He said the issue was being discussed by Labour, the SNP, Greens, the cross-party Public Services Committee (Psc) and Scottish Government ministers across government for 18 months.

Howitt said the Trade Union Bill was a "power grab", that would "effectively ban the right to strike" for all public sector workers.

He said there were "good reasons" why unions had sought to be involved in the process: to bring collective bargaining into the public sector and increase political participation.

Oppenheim challenged how the SNP was claiming to want to increase political participation.

"We are not proposing to ban the right to strike," Howitt said, adding the bill would allow "more choice" for workers.

"The Government does not talk about empowering individuals. Instead, it wishes only to restrict the ability of people to strike and limit workers' collective bargaining rights, with no real consultation or clear benefit for workers," he said.

Consequently, Healey attacked how the SNP was putting the interests of the state ahead of those of the people.

The SNP's position was "anti-democratic" and not compatible with devolution, he said.

"We know that the unions are not interested in the SNP putting the interests of the SNP. They are interested in the SNP putting the interests of the people of Scotland, and that is totally incompatible with a Tory agenda," he said.

The SNP has said it will change the Bill before it passes in the assembly and would not seek to delay it. If Labour doesn't change its mind, the government says it is preparing for a referendum on Scotland's place in the UK.
