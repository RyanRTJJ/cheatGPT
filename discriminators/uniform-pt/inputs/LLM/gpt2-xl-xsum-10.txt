reach the last rebel-held part of eastern Aleppo.
A resident of the rebel-held western district of al-Hol, which borders west Aleppo, said the army's arrival to al-Hol on Monday was followed by "hellfire and shells".
A resident of the nearby rebel-held district of al-Halab also said that fighting had resumed in the western districts after a lull earlier this year.
The Syrian military said on Monday it had reached an agreement with rebels to share more territory with them but said "no agreement has been reached on the division of Aleppo", state media reported.
"The Syrian armed forces and its allies from Russia and Iran have advanced towards the last areas still under the control of terrorists," it said on Twitter.
"The agreement on Aleppo talks have started, but there is no agreement. We have reached an agreement with rebels on the division of Aleppo, but there is no agreement on the division of Aleppo."
Syria's war has killed at least 250,000 people and forced millions from their homes.
"The operation is ongoing against Nusra and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) units... to restore security and stability," said Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoy, the Russian general commanding the campaign.
Lebanon's Hezbollah Shi'ite group joined the Russian campaign in Syria late last year, which is meant to help the Damascus government fight the Islamic State group and other rebel factions backed by Turkey, Gulf states and the West.
Syria's war has triggered a conflict between rebels and the Syrian regime, which has been supported by Russia since September 2015. The army has captured wide areas of the country.
Syrian state media has also aired footage of soldiers in the past month cutting off the hands of four men allegedly involved in a suicide bombing. The men, who are seen waving black flags, are shown being handcuffed and stripped.
The report comes amid concerns that the violence is escalating again in eastern Aleppo and that rebel defenses are collapsing before the army's advance.
