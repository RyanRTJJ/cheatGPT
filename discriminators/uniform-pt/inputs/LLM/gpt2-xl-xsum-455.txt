 additional revenue, the report says, it will fall short of its borrowing targets.

The council says there is an impact on people's everyday life, with some living off handouts, paying for extra council tax and some losing out on affordable housing.

The options include raising council tax by 11p to 38p and raising a further £1 for local services. This would add £32.9m to the gap if the council does not raise spending on other services too.

The report looks at nine different budgets, ranging from the lowest to the highest. None of them would require Council Tax to go up for the fifth consecutive year and this would be achieved by increasing borrowing in other ways.

The council wants input on three budget options, with these:

Raising council tax from 40p to 38p. This would bring in an extra £38.5m over three years - not including borrowing - resulting in a borrowing of £21.8m in 2018/19. The impact on families would be the largest. The report says it would affect: "Over half a million households by 2020/21 and 7,000 households a night."

Raising council tax from 38p to 53p. The revenue would come in part from the additional £1 generated by increasing rates for some local services - a savings of £20.2m over three years. Under this budget line it would be "virtually impossible" to hit Council Tax borrowing targets.

Raising council tax from 53p to 80p. This would add £26.3m in additional revenue over three years, not including borrowing. It would reduce the deficit to just under £20m by 2020/21.

The last option, raising council tax by 83p from August 2018 to August 2019, would come in at £20.4m less than this budget.

The council says it is not looking at the possibility of borrowing and said the decision on options will be announced a little further down the line in July, with a final vote in favour of raising council tax taking place on Wednesday (22 July). The report says the budget may then come back
