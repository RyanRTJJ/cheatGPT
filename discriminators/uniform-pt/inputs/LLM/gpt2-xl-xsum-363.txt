ying undeveloped land, thereby charging tenants for it, and then letting it out for development elsewhere) has not only been ineffective, but has also meant that developers have been unable to build, leaving thousands of homes stuck in the planning system.

The research also reveals that in most of the key areas of the country where the "unaffordable" house tax is imposed, house prices have risen faster than wages and house-owners are more likely to be from "goodly financial status". This confirms that it is not just the lowest income group who are the most affected by house prices falling. It also shows there is a mismatch between the availability of affordable homes for those on low incomes and their expectations of the supply of new housing.

So the Treasury appears to have done very well on its latest report, because it appears to have convinced a sceptical public that reducing house prices will be good for the economy.

More than that, housing ministers have persuaded a sceptical public that there is even a need for the policy, that in fact the housing crisis is a problem of supply, because that is how they have always imagined it.

Now the reality of the situation is becoming clear, that the housing crisis that is now so painfully evident has nothing to do with property price levels. It has been going on for years and the Government has done nothing about it. Instead it has made policies that do very little to relieve it and has encouraged a private market where landlords are free to build more and more houses - creating a housing crisis that has made housing for most families, and especially the poorest, more difficult.

There is an irony here that Labour and the Greens have in many ways been in favour of the housing development agenda and in some cases have pushed it more vigorously than the Conservatives. Indeed Ed Miliband has said that "we need to make sure the market has a big
