The Home Office said it would work with the Crown Prosecution Service to establish what action can be taken next against those named on the list of 11 individuals who will not be prosecuted for hate crime. But it will not say what punishment, if any, will be handed down.

Although there has long been no criminal offence for inciting hatred in Britain, the authorities in recent times have increasingly used civil law to deal with what has been described as a rise in the "criminalisation" of the "ordinary and everyday" aspects of ethnic minority community life.

In November, Leeds Crown Court heard that a school headteacher was suspended for a period for allegedly failing to refer an ethnic minority boy to a psychiatrist because he was too depressed and anxious to leave his room.

In October, a student at the University of Edinburgh was suspended for two days for posting on Facebook how he would like to see a Muslim woman murdered and his mother raped. Last year, a woman was imprisoned for three months for repeatedly calling a Muslim woman a "slag". The maximum sentence for the crime of inciting hatred is five years in prison. But a report on racial intolerance prepared by the Home Office last year estimated that the real number of offences had reached a record high of 5.5m and cited "disproportionate" police handling of such offences.
