 for their higher office, particularly in the wake of scandals.

"It is critical that we ensure there are more of these important public servants in our country who can hold ministers to account and act as trusted spokespeople for their constituents," Mr Farron said.

Alison McGovern, the former director of public prosecutions, has been pushing for the decision to be rescinded. She said: "I am delighted that our work for justice is reflected in today's decision to appoint an additional commissioner of the Public Defenders Service.

"The public could be reassured that the appointment of a commissioner will ensure that the public will have a chance to hold to account the actions of public officials and ensure those public officials who abuse their power are held to account."

The UK government said that it welcomed the decision. "It will restore confidence in the profession and provide the essential public servants that parliament wants," said a spokesperson. "We believe that the AMs who will be selected are those appropriate to represent the interests of their constituencies."

The move has been welcomed by the Public Directors Association, which represents the public sector.

Robert Hannigan-Smith, the association's director general, said: "Although the government has not yet commented on the decision, I believe it is reasonable and prudent to say that the appointment of the additional commissioner of the public directors service is a positive and appropriate step.

"We are hopeful that the government's consultation will demonstrate that we have not overlooked the important role, and value, that public service directors bring to the public sector."

The public directors service was established by the Public Directors Act 2011. In his speech announcing its creation, the then environment secretary Owen Paterson said it was the "unsung hero of the government's reform agenda".

Theresa May, the current home secretary, has been pushing for AMs to replace chief public prosecutors and is reported to have discussed it with ministers at the Tory party
