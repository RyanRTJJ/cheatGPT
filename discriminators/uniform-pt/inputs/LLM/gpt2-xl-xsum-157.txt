Brazilian prosecutors said on Friday the singer could face a fine or up to 60 days in prison after he used his phone to snap pictures of the wall which in real life was covered in graffiti. The images were circulated to local media.

The image on the wall, reported by the A Folha newspaper website, shows a black and white painting that appears to depict a man painting a wall.

His management company confirmed that Pinto had visited the street on the outskirts of Sao Paulo where the wall was located. A spokesman told AFP via text message: "We don't know how a man with a camera was able to cover such a big building and we don't know why he was there at night with a black camera."

A statement posted on his website says Pinto is in Brazil helping with repairs at his "local business" and that the graffiti incident was "an isolated act which was caught by the hotel in which he is taking care for repairs".

The statement said "on the ground", he had painted "a special message of love" on the wall. But he also painted an "expectation and a guarantee" beneath the message on which he said he would fix the building.

The statement said the management company had already started work on the wall and the musician planned to move in to help move furniture after the work is completed.

A federal police spokeswoman told AFP the action was a serious offense.

"He could be charged with damage to public and private property, in addition to a fine," she told the news agency.
