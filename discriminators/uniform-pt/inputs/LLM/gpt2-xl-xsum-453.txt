This week, more than a quarter of the 14,000 people screened for heart health – a key measure of overall health – came back at high risk of heart failure, according to the NHS Choices website.

The charity says the situation is likely to be repeated in the next 18 months as the government aims to improve the country's NHS-focused health and fitness levels.
