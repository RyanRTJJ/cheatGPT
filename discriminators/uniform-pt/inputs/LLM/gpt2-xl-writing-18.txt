Hello!  I was actually looking for this post, and I am so happy to find it.  It's a lovely piece of poetry that I will include in my collection of poetry because it touches so many things.  When my mom was first diagnosed with autism, we had her come up with some ideas on what would be useful to have in our life.  We were looking at books, crafts, jewelry, toys and other items to fill this void in our lives, and her mother had some of her favorite childrens stories to read.   She was not an avid reader and had never read much of any of those tales before, but what she loved about the stories is that they are not quite all bad.  For example, she liked to read about good girls, strong women, brave heroes and happy endings.  After all, her life had been filled with hard times, and she knew that there is always hope.   I'm a huge fan of her book collection.  She has one for her sons, too, and one for her friends, too.  She always had them all, and they were never expensive to go to.  My husband and I have been working on putting together this beautiful children's book collection ever since our sister was diagnosed with autism this year, and we're not doing a very good job!
