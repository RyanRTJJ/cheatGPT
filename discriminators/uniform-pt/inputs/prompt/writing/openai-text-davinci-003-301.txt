Write a story based on this prompt: Your Father owns a small chain of ski resorts, and one of the oldest locations has gone belly up. In the month after closing you secretly begin turning on the lifts for just yourself. One day you become aware of how alone you are. On the side of a mountain that nobody has reason to visit.
