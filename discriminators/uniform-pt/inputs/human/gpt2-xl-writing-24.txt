 Mike's wide eyes started to relax a little bit as he realized he hadn't taken his medicine in three days. He had been sitting with his sniper rifle nudged up against his eyeball and had been waiting for something, anything to walk out of the doors of that factory. If he didn't take his medicine right now, this "imaginary friend" of Haley's would be the next thing he shot. He started to unclip the trappings that surrounded him, so as to wiggle his body out of the bush camouflage and slump himself down behind the ledge of the burned out post office. As he felt his boots touch the ground, an enemy soldier stood with his face covered, an AK pointed at Mike's waist. Mike raised his gun to fire, but the AK shot first and pierced Mike's stomach lining. He felt no pain as the adrenaline inside him forced him to pull the trigger and carve a piece of flesh out of his enemy. The blood splattered against the crumbling concrete, and suddenly, three more soldiers entered the building with haste. Mike ducked down behind an overturned desk, but despite that, he saw two more bullets slice through his jacket lining. The whole time, a voice kept perking up in his head, trying to "guide" him and "protect" him. "Shut the fuck up!" He shouted out loud, and suddenly the gunfire stopped. He looked down and realized that he had no bullet wounds. In fact, there were no bullet holes in the desk either. Everything was calm, silent and just the way it had been. The only sign of battle was a hole he had made in the concrete himself, when he had shot it at nothing- the supposed enemy soldier of his mind. Mike sighed, relieved but concerned for his own sanity. He had never had an episode like this. Flashbacks were supposed to start *after* the battle, and Mike was already shooting at shadows.
