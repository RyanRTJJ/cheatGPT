atroopers opened fire at a civil rights march. Hillsborough campaigner Margaret Aspinall said the families "must carry on" the pursuit for truth and justice. The Bloody Sunday inquiry, led by Lord Saville, took 12 years to complete and exonerated those who died. Following the findings of the report Prime Minister David Cameron said he was "deeply sorry". In April, a jury found that the 96 football fans who died in the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster were unlawfully killed. Margaret Aspinall's 18-year-old son James died at the FA Cup semi-final. She said families of victims of the Troubles should never give up the pursuit of justice. "They must carry on, I'm a great believer that everybody, no matter who they are, deserves the truth. "Stay strong and keep the hope going like the families of Hillsborough had to, that's what kept us going, the hope that one day we would get it. "With other people, the Bloody Sunday families, we are united in truth and justice. It is very, very important to stick together and show your support to each other." Margaret Aspinall, Sue Roberts and Jenni Hicks have campaigned for 27 years to uncover the truth of the 1989 stadium disaster. In conversation with Paul O'Connor, director of the Pat Finucane Centre, they also met with some family members of the Loughinisland massacre and Michael Gallagher of the Omagh Bomb Families. Last week, a report by Northern Ireland's Police Ombudsman showed there was collusion between some police officers and loyalist gunmen who killed six Catholics 22 years ago. Reflecting on the Hillsborough inquest verdict, Mrs Aspinall said it left a legacy for others to follow. "We hope what we've got from this, by fighting the system for all these years, is that it gives other people hope. "What comes after truth? Justice. The only way you can get justice is accountability. "So somebody has got to be held to account for 96 innocent deaths and for all the fans and survivors still suffering to this day," she said.
