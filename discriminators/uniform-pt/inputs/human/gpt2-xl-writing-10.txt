 In bunker 7090, there are seven people left. We've always stuck together like a second nature, me and you, ever since we were kids. It was definitely natural that we ended up in the same high school, same college. It was destiny we ended up in the same government job. Everything else was meant to be. Me and you, all those evenings spent in the park, all those fancy dinners you cooked that I pretended to enjoy. It was definitely nice. And natural. Like waking up next to you. That felt natural, too. But whatever's happened to earth.... To us, all of us. That's not natural. The fact that the only people who know what happened to everything.... The fact that we, us who are'in the know' survived, locked away here? That's not natural. That's something else and thinking about that scares me. And I've seen the way you've always looked at that woman, the blonde from our department, with the longer legs than I have. She's thinner, and her eyes are bluer, too. I can see why you'd like her. When everything was normal and natural, I remember thinking how I'd make sure she didn't get close to you, and how I'd never let her tear us apart. Now that I know more about the world I'm not so sure I care anymore. In our world of seven people and no other contact for months, if she makes you happy, I can rest a little easier. So hey, chin up, and remember that you should always throw out socks with holes in, you hobo. And when you're wooing blondie, never ever cook for her. Not that there's much choice besides our rations, but don't even try it. And that beard you're'trying out'? It didn't work when we were 20, and it's not working now. I didn't understand at first why they left us guns down here, but I think I get it now. Best wishes for the future, as pretentious as that may sound. I hope whoever finds me doesn't have to go through too much. -me
