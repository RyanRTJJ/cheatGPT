 "They'll kill you for this Kal." "It's just fiction. It's what I write anyway. Just endless lies, words to satisfy the prompts the censors create each day to keep the masses entertained." She took my hand, the heavy clack of the typewriter falling silent. It's springs were old and the ribbon had long since passed the point of legibility, but it was the last free tool I had in this world. She was beautiful, her blonde hair and blue eyes the culmination of generations of ideological breeding. A smile was how the world saw her, but there was despair beneath it and my words only deepened the divide. "You can't play with history like this," she said. "These ideas.... they're dangerous." "Dangerous?" Arik began crying and she looked into the other room. At the child she had left and the empty crib beside his. Pain flashed across her face, her beautiful face, and then the mask returned. "The world is as it is. Write the truth, their truth." "Truth? London, Moscow, destroyed by the atom bombs. The Americans with their tails between their legs." "Yes." "No," I said and my hands rested across the keys. "Why Kal? Why won't you leave this fanciful ideas?" "Because I know there is a better world out there. One where people aren't afraid of what they say or write or think." I put a hand against her own and squeezed. "One where we have two children, because the state does not have the right to say who is worthy of living and who isn't." She pulled her hand back and covered her face. Arik's crying drew her away from me but she stopped, clutching at the frame of the door and turned her head just enough for me to see the tears. "You write your words, live in your fantasy. I'll deal with the real world. Even if it's just me and our son."
