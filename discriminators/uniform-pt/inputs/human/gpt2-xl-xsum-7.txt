 with Zoe". Earlier this week Zoella, whose real name is Zoe Sugg, confirmed she had received "help" writing her novel. Ms Curham also said she was not looking for "fame" or to "get rich" when she agreed to work on Girl Online. "I love writing books and I love helping others write books," she wrote. "When I was offered the opportunity to help Zoe, I also saw the opportunity to help get important and empowering messages across to her incredibly huge fan-base. "Messages about self belief, anxiety, sexuality and - oh the irony - online hate. That was my sole motivation for taking the job." The author, who has written a number of young adult novels published under her own name, said the success of Girl Online had helped many bookshops turn a profit. "Penguin, and many other publishers around the world, are now able to afford to offer more unknown writers book deals," she wrote. Ms Curham also alluded to the issue of "transparency in celebrity publishing" and said Zoella should not be blamed for a practice that has been going on for a number of years. Earlier this week, Penguin issued a statement saying it was part of a publisher's role to "help" new talent. Many of Zoella's fans sent positive messages to the YouTube star after her announcement, saying that they still "loved" the book. More than 78,000 copies of Girl Online were sold in its first week of publication. After the figures were released, Zoella tweeted: "I'm legit blown away by this. I never in a million years thought that so many of you would pick up a copy of Girl Online. Almost want to cry." The record is the highest since sales recording system Nielsen BookScan began collecting information on the book market in 1998, according to The Bookseller. It is the first of a two-book deal Zoella has with Penguin. Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube
