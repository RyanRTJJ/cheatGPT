 Houston this is the ss. Ted Cruz preparing for landing brought to you by McDonalds, Walmart, and the Koch brothers. Houston - "k." ship lands. I step on the soft martian soil, but what I felt.... it was a familiar feeling. DOG SHIT!!! but how. Elon Musk said that there are no dogs are mars probably. I laser beam my brain waves to Houston. They scan my brainigrovies to see if it was clogged with dust again. Houston said it was all clear, Houston is a pretty cool dude, sometimes we go to the mall and he buys me things, its not gay.... shut the fuck up. anyways I examine the dog shit on my boot and notice that there is a note in it. the note says, "to whom ever gives a shit, take one, lol get shit on." By god.... hes speaking the lords English, and that's like an earth thing I think. But if I'm on mars, and this is an earth thing, and I'm not on earth, then this earth thing not on earth is mars thing but has things like earth thing. It was the find of a century. I walked for 500 hundred miles until I saw and ancient looking corner store. I went inside to inspect it and what do you know, I found a flyer. the flyers states "hey wouldn't be funny if we moved to that shithole earth. - Mlon Husk" By Jove, the human race moved to earth for shits and giggles and now we are doing the same thing. This cycle must end. So the astroun no one is gon na read past the first two sentences. so the astronaut went back in his space machine and flew to Venus where he started a new age for man kind. there was volcano and acid, and it was cool as fuck.
