 Why am I walking to that place again? I promise my wife I wouldn't go back, but here I am knocking on the cold iron door in the middle of the pouring rain. I was almost done though I just needed one more chapter just one more page and I'll be done. I'll be done for good. The door opened and a young brunette pulled her hand out. I shyly took out my wallet and showed her the card my friend gave me 6 months ago. She smiled and showed me in. The lightening in this place was always horrible and the smell was so much worth, but here I am walking towards the same aisle looking in the same section. Just one more chapter I keep reminding myself. As I began to make my way towards the “ classics ” I couldn't help notice how the computers were always filled. I guess it's less embarrassing then doing that walk of shame to the aisle of your preference, but at least you don't have to worry about sticky pages while using the computer. But today is the day I'll be done, no more smell, no more having to explain where I've been, and no more guessing about the end. Just one more chapter. I finally have it in my already sweaty hands. I made my way to a table I began to flip through where I left off. “ 153, 153 ” I kept thinking. There was a flash and a ringing. I couldn't see anything. I only heard shouting. Oh no we're being raided. People were rushing toward the back exit. I grabbed the book and did the same, but they reached the back. “ It couldn't end like this ” I thought. I ran to the shelves. I saw many others on the ground also trying to finish what they started. Just one more Chapter I thought as I held my tears back, just one more chapter.
