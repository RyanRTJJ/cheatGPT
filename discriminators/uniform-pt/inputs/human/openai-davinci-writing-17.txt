<<SEP>>>Why am I walking to that place again? I promise my wife I wouldn't go back, but here I am knocking on the cold iron door in the middle of the pouring rain. I was almost done though I just needed one more chapter just one more page and I'll be done. I'll be done for good. The door opened and a young brunette pulled her hand out. I shyly took out my wallet and showed her the card my friend gave me 6 months ago. She smiled and showed me in. The lightening in this place was always horrible and the smell was so much worth, but here I am walking towards the same aisle looking in the same section. Just one more chapter I keep reminding myself. As I began to make my way towards the “ classics ” I couldn't help notice how the computers were always filled.
