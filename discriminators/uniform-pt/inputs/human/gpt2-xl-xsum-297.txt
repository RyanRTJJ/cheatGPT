 I'm aware of that. It's an obvious calculation which everybody is telling me and it's great. "But the approach is keep it simple - just look for the race win." Rosberg can afford to finish second to Hamilton in all the remaining races, with Brazil and Abu Dhabi in November following Mexico City, and still win the title. Even one third place and two seconds would be enough. He owes his advantage partially to the reliability problems that have hit Hamilton disproportionately through the year. But he said he was not allowing himself to think about the fact that, by the law of averages, he is due a technical failure. "That's not within my control so I completely block that out," Rosberg said before this weekend's race in Mexico. Hamilton won in Austin on Sunday to cut his deficit to Rosberg but because there are now only three races remaining the victory did not change the mathematical situation between the two. It was Hamilton's first win since the German Grand Prix at the end of July, following a string of problems for the Briton, some of them technical, some of his own making. It was also his first win from pole position since the British Grand Prix two races before Germany. Know someone who volunteers in sport and deserves recognition for their efforts? Give them the chance to shine by nominating them. "Not many seasons there can be 100% reliability on a car," said Hamilton. "Will that be the case on Nico's? I guess time will tell. "I can't get fixated on that. I just have to focus on mine. "I am hoping that for these last four I have 100% reliability. That would be a breath of fresh air and I will try to utilise that opportunity with driving as I did in Austin."
