<<SEP>>>I'll never forget that night. The night that could have changed the world. I was destined to make history. Strange how I never wanted to follow in his footsteps. I wanted to write. My natural curiosity got me involved in my father's ambitions. I always respected him and knew that my choices reflected on him as well. All those years I had studied and read. I worked hard, Ivy league schools weren't easy. They never are when you're in your father's limelight. Then the war came. I knew I had to do my duty to my country, to freedom. If I didn't go, someone else would in my place. It was their I knew what I had to do to protect our freedoms.
