 gunned down in Sydney Parramatta's suburb last Friday. His killer, 15-year-old Farhad Jabar, was shot dead by police at the scene. Police believe Jabar had been radicalised. Four people suspected of being linked to the attack were arrested in raids in western Sydney this week, but most have now been released without charge. On Friday after holding talks with Muslim leaders, Mr Turnbull said violent extremism was "a challenge to the fundamental Australian value" of mutual respect in a multicultural society. "It is not compulsory to live in Australia," he said. "If you find Australian values are, you know, unpalatable, then there's a big wide world out there and people have got freedom of movement."

He encouraged Australians to "call out the language of hatred wherever it is practised". Earlier on Friday, the chairman of the mosque in Parramatta, Neil El-Kadomi, told worshippers that they should appreciate what Australia had done for them. "We live in Australia," he said, in comments quoted by Fairfax Media. "Australia gives us lots of benefits, there's opportunity and you are allowed to practise your religion freely." He told Fairfax Media there was no place for extremism
