 posts showed him discharging the stun guns. Sentencing him, judge Lord Ericht told Morton: "You were well aware that what you were doing was wrong." The High Court in Edinburgh heard that Morton was detained after his baggage was searched by customs officers who found the two stun guns hidden in a jumper. After he was charged over the illegal importation, Morton replied: "Well, where's the evidence." Facebook videos were later found in which Morton revealed he was at a resort in Bulgaria. In the clip he said: "I just went to the supermarket today and I bought, as you can see, a nice iphone4s. How would you like to have one of these yourself?" Morton then demonstrated the weapon, which can discharge about 5,000 volts, on film, before saying that anyone who opposes him "will get tasered and that's the truth". In further incriminating footage he was heard saying: "Got an iphone 4 but it's no, it's a shocker." Morton also posted on his Facebook page that he was in Bulgaria and was going to bring back stun guns to the UK to sell for Â£300 each. The judge rejected a defence plea that there were exceptional circumstances which would allow him not to impose the minimum five-year sentence for possessing the weapons laid down by Parliament. Lord Ericht said: "The minimum sentence cannot be said to be arbitrary or disproportionate." He said that selling the stun guns would have put them into the hands of others who may have used them for violent purposes. Lord Ericht said he had paid careful attention to evidence about Morton's IQ, but added: "In my view that does not constitute an exceptional circumstance." Defence counsel Laura Reilly told the court that 99% of the population had a higher IQ than Morton and he had been assessed as posing a low risk of re-offending. Morton told the court: "I thought it was OK to bring them back."
