The new trade union law would force unions to give employers 14 days' notice of action and could limit the amount of money unions have to mount campaigns.

After widespread civil unrest and protest, it was replaced by the council tax in 1993. A Scottish government spokesperson said: "We have set out our clear and strong opposition to the proposals in the Trade Union Bill, which we regard as a totally unjustified attack on workers' rights.
