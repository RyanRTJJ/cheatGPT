 police on Monday. China has lodged a complaint calling for its citizens to be protected. At a press conference on Wednesday, Francois Ormillien, one of the lawyers representing the family, said: "We know that this incident has caused some turmoil. "The family wished for this press conference to launch an appeal for calm." Police have said that Mr Liu was shot as he tried to attack an officer with a sharp object. His family had said earlier that Mr Liu was holding a pair of scissors as he was preparing fish for dinner. On Wednesday, their lawyers said he had not attacked nor rushed at the officers, and that details of his death remained "extremely obscure". One of Mr Liu's daughters, who was in the apartment at the time, also gave her account. "They began to bang on our door and then we heard something we didn't know who it was, by that time I was stricken with panic. "My father was really trying to hold back the door and then the door opened all of a sudden. A shot was fired. All of this happened in just a few seconds," she was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. Read more: French Chinese 'at breaking point'
