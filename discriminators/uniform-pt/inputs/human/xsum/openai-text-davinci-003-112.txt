 guidelines. Kevin McGrath, who attends three appointments a week, said: "This really is a matter of life and death." He lives about a mile away from the hospital but is too weak to walk to his sessions, which last about four hours each. Mr McGrath will be one of about 30 of the 100 or so renal dialysis patients which the hospital says will no longer receive free transport. About 30 patients will continue to qualify through benefits and another 40 for medical reasons, such as being wheelchair bound, the hospital said. Mr McGrath said he was concerned about other patients who have further to travel. "We've got patients from Washbrook to Aldeburgh," he said. "If they're expected to fund their own taxis, people can't do it. They just can't afford it." He has signed a petition calling for the hospital to reconsider the withdrawal of funding. Catherine Morgan, associate director of nursing at Ipswich Hospital, said the hospital was following national Department of Health guidelines. She said the hospital had to treat all patients equally. "For renal patients, it's understandably a distressing and difficult situation," she said.
