 and The Charlatans are the headline acts for this year's events in the Scottish capital. The Edinburgh events are estimated to be worth more than Â£40m to the Scottish economy. Police Scotland said there would be a "very visible police presence" at the event. Divisional commander Ch Supt Kenny MacDonald said: "I'm confident we have an appropriate and proportionate policing plan in place to make sure we deliver a safe and secure event." Revellers are to be allowed back on to Calton Hill this year after a ban over safety fears was lifted. Council officials decided to shut the city landmark for six hours over the bells last year saying "the hill was unlit and uneven under foot". However, the City of Edinburgh Council decided to do a U-turn following a review of last year's events. Some fireworks are also fired from the hill as part of the midnight display. More than 1,000 hours of planning goes into delivering the Midnight Moment at Edinburgh's Hogmanay Street Party, widely regarded as the UK's most intense six minutes of fireworks. There is 8km of wire connecting up to 94 modules, each with 32 cues, to deliver the 2.6 tonnes of fireworks up to 300m above the Edinburgh skyline. They are fired by 14 pyrotechnicians from Titanium Fireworks. There will be more than 10,000 shots and stars in every firework colour. Nearly 10 tonnes of equipment will be used, filling three lorries and five vans. Once 2017 has arrived, a team of more than 25 people from Titanium Fireworks, Unique Events and Historic Scotland will work into the night to clear in eight hours what took five days to set up. All the empty cardboard tubes will be recycled - enough to fill three large skips - as well as a metre square crate with igniter wire. The Hogmanay celebrations follow a torchlight procession from The Mound to Calton Hill on Friday.
