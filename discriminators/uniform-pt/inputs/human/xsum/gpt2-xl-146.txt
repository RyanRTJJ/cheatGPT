 remaining seven races. Hamilton said: "That's irrelevant. I don't go into the next seven races thinking I have to finish second. "I think I have to go and win every one. You don't think about that stuff." Hamilton described his race in Italy as the "perfect weekend", after for the first time in his career achieving a 'full house' of being fastest in all practice sessions, all three parts of qualifying, winning the race and setting fastest lap.

Hamilton, who has won seven of the 12 races so far this season and taken 11 pole positions, said he felt empathy for Rosberg, who was running third in the race when his engine failed with two laps to go. "Other people I know would be, like, 'Yes!'" Hamilton said. "But for some reason I don't have that in me. "When I shake his hand I feel bad because I know what it's like to be in that position and lose when everything has been perfect." Rosberg, whose wife gave birth to their first daughter in the days before the Italian race, admitted that his chances of beating Hamilton to the title were fading fast.

To lose so many points in one day is a massive loss." "In my mind I am with my two girls who are waiting at home, that's the best way to get over a day like this. "It's going to be very difficult from now for sure. That's a lot of points. But I won't give up; I'll go for it." Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff, who runs the teams with a philosophy of leaving the drivers free to race, said the championship was now "difficult" for Rosberg.
