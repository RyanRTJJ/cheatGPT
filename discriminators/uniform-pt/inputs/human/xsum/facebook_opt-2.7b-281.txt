ighshire, died at Deepcut Barracks in Surrey in November 1995. Her father Des James, from Llanymynech, Powys, said he would approach the hearing with an "open mind". "I don't have a result in mind. I just want the truth," he said. "If it is a suicide verdict, as long as we answer the questions - what created that environment? How did it happen? - then that's fine." Pte James, who was found dead with a gunshot to the head, was one of four soldiers who died at the barracks between 1995 and 2002 amid claims of bullying and abuse. The new inquest was granted by the High Court in 2014 after the open verdict recorded at the original inquest in December 1995 was quashed. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Eye on Wales programme ahead of the fresh hearing, Mr James said: "There's no wrong verdict for me in this. "As long as the process is impeccable, as long as I can look back and say everything we could do, we've done, that's the important thing." More than 100 people are due to give evidence when the inquest begins in Woking, Surrey. That number could rise if the coroner overrules Ministry of Defence objections and allows a request from Mr James' legal team to call former Deepcut recruits to testify about the alleged wider culture of bullying and abuse at the camp. "My view is that these witnesses give credence to the culture that I believe pervaded that camp," he said. "Therefore they should be valid in an inquest court becauseâ€¦ the Ministry of Defence deny there was a cultural issue. "Surely to prove there was a cultural issue we have to have these people allowed to speak." A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: "Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Private Cheryl James. "The inquest will now be a matter for the coroner, but we will of course continue to cooperate with and provide support to the coroner where needed."
