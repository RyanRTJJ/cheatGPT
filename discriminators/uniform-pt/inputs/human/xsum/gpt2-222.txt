 to get in touch with family and friends. A statement from his family said: "We still have every hope we can find Edward alive." They said he was an experienced hillwalker and had intended to climb Sgurr na h-Ulaidh. "We know he was very likely to be in this area or the area of Ben Finlay during the day, potentially early in the morning," the statement said. "This is a critical time for Edward. He is very likely to have a small dark grey/green one man tent with him for emergencies and supplies adequate to last several days." The family added: "Edward is physically capable and an experienced hillwalker. He is also a wildlife enthusiast who may have been drawn to particular nature spots beyond the area. "The weather on the Sunday and through the week has been excellent so we still have every hope we can find Edward alive. "We love Edward very much and are all desperate for his safe return. "We would urge anyone who was walking in the area weekend of 7/8th May or since to think back with these details in mind and consider any potential sightings of Ed or anything that may assist the search effort. "Ed's friends and family wish to thank everyone involved in the search so far, especially police and Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team. Their support and determination has been overwhelming." Mr Davies is slim with dark hair and was thought to have been wearing a blue RAB waterproof jacket, a T-shirt or green Buffalo fleece. The last known sighting of him was on the evening of Saturday 7 May at the Clachaig Inn, Glencoe. Over the weekend, members of Glencoe, Oban, Lochaber and RAF mountain rescue teams, search and rescue dog teams, police officers and a coastguard helicopter carried out searches. The teams' search areas included Aonach Dubh a Ghlinne, Meall Mhor, River Coe and Signal Rock. Anyone who thinks they may have seen Mr Davies should contact police.
