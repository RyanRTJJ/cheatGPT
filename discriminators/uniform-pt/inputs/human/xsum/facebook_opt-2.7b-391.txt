 were injured in the incident. At 21:00 BST Eurotunnel said there were no delays from the UK, but some disruption to services from Calais. Eurostar advised customers to check in as normal but to expect delays of up to 60 minutes. There had been delays of up to three hours during Saturday morning while all services ran just one of the two tunnels. The disruption affected both Eurotunnel, which runs freight and car services, and Eurostar, which runs passenger trains using St Pancras, Ebbsfleet and Ashford stations. Eurotunnel said it was concerned there may be another attempt at a breach. Staff were "being very careful because it was such a different tactic, a different approach last night", it added. Trains were stopped from 23:30 BST on Friday after security staff were overwhelmed by the "number and aggression" of the group, Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said. People had gone to the end of new security fencing, installed during the summer months, and broken through older fences. Police were waiting at the tunnel to round up those who reached it, he added. He said staff were shoved and stones thrown as security fences were breached. "Services were suspended because of the very large, determined and organised group of migrants who burst through the fence and made their way to the terminal," he said. French police and British authorities removed people from the area. The situation in Calais is part of a wider migrant crisis across Europe, with huge numbers of people heading north from the Mediterranean. Extra security, including fencing, paid for by the UK, started to be put in place in the summer. It is aimed at making it harder for migrants to get onto the platforms and trains heading into the Channel Tunnel. A man died on Wednesday near the tunnel entrance in Calais - the 13th migrant to die trying to reach the UK since late June and the fourth to have died in September.
