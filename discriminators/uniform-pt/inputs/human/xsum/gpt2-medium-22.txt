 have been cancelled at Southampton airport. A Met Office fog warning for much of southern England has now been lifted, but forecasters say there could be further disruption on Tuesday morning. The cold weather has also meant parts of the UK are suffering from high levels of air pollution, which is expected to continue into Tuesday, as pollutants fail to disperse in the still conditions. Met Office forecaster Emma Boorman said it was likely patches of dense fog would re-form overnight to cause "potential disruption" in parts of England and Wales, particularly in the south. On Monday morning, Heathrow, London City, Gatwick, Southampton and Stansted airports - where visibility has been at 100m - all warned passengers to check flight updates before travelling. Heathrow said the effect of fog on flights there could be more noticeable than at most airports because it operates at 98% capacity, meaning it is harder to space flights out. Stansted has been taking some diverted flights from London City Airport, with a spokesman saying seven had landed so far, but passengers have been warned of further disruption due to the fog. Flights to Amsterdam were the worst-affected due to fog at Schiphol Airport. Liverpool Airport also said fog and low visibility had affected them on Monday morning, despite not being covered by the weather warning. On Sunday evening, freezing fog led to two flights bound for Southampton having to divert to Bristol and Bournemouth airports, but Luton has not been affected. Forecasters said temperatures would struggle to top 0C (32F) in the worst-affected areas on Monday, although it was a rise from the -8C (17.6F) recorded
