, 41, was murdered in Islington on 29 December, 2015 when he left home to post cards announcing the birth of his daughter Fleur. Nigerian student Femi Nandap, 23, admitted carrying out the knife attack. He was handed an indefinite hospital order in October. The Old Bailey was told that police were alerted to the fact that Nandap had gone to Nigeria while on bail and that he was receiving psychiatric treatment while there, despite facing trial in the UK for knife-related offences committed earlier in 2015. Days before the killing, the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case against Nandap in a magistrates' court, saying it had "insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction" over charges of possession of two knives and assaulting a policeman. Ms Ensink-Teich said lessons had not been learned. "It's an issue with austerity, it's an issue with not sharing information. If the police and CPS collaborated, information would have been shared," she said. "The CPS did not even know he was in a mental hospital. All the information came out later on. If they had known about that before, he would have got psychiatric help and then it might not have happened." She added: "The CPS said a mistake has been made and the charges should not have been dropped. "Clearly, mistakes have happened and they admit it and it's like, so what? There was no sorry. There was nothing. "I do not know if there are going to be any consequences and they won't discuss this with me." An inquest is due to be held into the death of Dr Ensink in April, but his widow fears it will not deal with the wider issues. She said: "I do not think they will look much further at what could have been done to prevent this. "I see it as a start. I don't think it's the end of it." The CPS declined to comment.
