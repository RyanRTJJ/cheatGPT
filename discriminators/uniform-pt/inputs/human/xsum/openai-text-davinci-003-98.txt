 of the 30cm tube at the Great North Children's Hospital, her father Dan took to Facebook for help. The tube was driven more than 150 miles (240km) from Glasgow by volunteers. Mr Grace, said: "It was awful to see her so ill and we had to do something about it. "I've seen other people do it and I know how powerful the use of social media can be." After more than 30,000 shares from as far as America and Australia, within 24 hours the right part was located at the QE hospital in Glasgow. "I was just shocked really, my phone has been pinging and pinging will all the shares and requests and messages of help and support, it was unbelievable, really humbling," Mr Grace added. Medical transport charity ScotsERVS sent volunteers Sarah Cameron and Euan Mitchell with the part and Molly was operated on the same night. Ms Cameron, said: "We are sort of turning into the unofficial A Team - if there's an issue with long-distance transport, we seem to be the ones to call upon. "The patients are what it's all about and we had the opportunity to help so we did." Mr Mitchell said: "It was very humbling to meet a brave young lady like Molly and speak to her mum and dad and know that this could potentially give her a bit of respite." A spokesperson for Newcastle
