 when healthy cells are damaged during treatment. Macmillan says patients should be offered continuing support after their treatment for cancer. Although more people are surviving cancer than ever before, thanks to better detection and new treatments, Macmillan says there can be long-term physical and mental consequences to cancer treatment which often go untreated. Using a combination of published data and expert opinion, they calculated that 25% of those who have been diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives will be affected. Currently, they estimate that 350,000 people are living with sexual difficulties, 240,000 with mental health problems, 150,000 are affected by urinary problems such as incontinence, and 90,000 are experiencing problems like diarrhoea and bleeding as a result of having had cancer.

"Many of these problems can be managed using simple and inexpensive interventions by health professionals, while other more complex issues require specialist services."

"We are urging them to ensure that all cancer patients receive a 'cancer recovery package' at the end of their treatment offering ongoing support." He added that no-one should be left to face the long-term
