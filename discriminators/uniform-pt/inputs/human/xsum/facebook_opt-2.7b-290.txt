 argued during their appeal that the punishment was unfair. But the Court of Appeal has ruled the sentences were justified because of the dangers the men posed. It means a string of sentencing hearings for Syria-related terrorism offences, which had been on hold pending the ruling, can now go ahead. The three men had all admitted preparing for acts of terrorism. Each was given an extended sentence - meaning a jail term plus additional monitoring on licence in the community - last April. Dart, from Weymouth, sought training in Pakistan and then discussed plans to attack Royal Wootton Bassett, the town that was the focal point for the repatriation of soldiers killed in Afghanistan, with others in the UK. The other two men, Zahid Iqbal and Mohammed Sharfaraz Ahmed, from Luton, had prepared for a possible attack on Luton's Territorial Army base. Dart received a six-year extended sentence, meaning he must serve at least two-thirds in jail before he can be considered for release on licence. At the end of those six years, he will be subject to a further five years of monitoring under licence in the community. He would face the risk of being sent back to jail if he committed another offence during that time. Iqbal and Ahmed received extended sentences of just over 16 years - comprising an 11-year jail sentence plus an extra five on licence.
