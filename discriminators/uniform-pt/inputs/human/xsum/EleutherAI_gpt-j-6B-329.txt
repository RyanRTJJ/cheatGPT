. Police Scotland said members of Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team were making searches where it was considered safe to do so. The force has also renewed an appeal to hillwalkers and climbers for details of where they were on Ben Nevis last Sunday, or on the days after. A spokesman said the appeal was not only for potential sightings of the couple, but also to help build up a picture of places where they were not seen to help focus the search effort. Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team said the forecast this week was looking better and they would try to have search parties out most days. The searches will concentrate in the area of Coire na Ciste. Rescuers also appealed to anyone planning to climb on the UK's highest peak this week to post their routes on the Lochaber MRT's Facebook page to help them eliminate parts of the mountain. A post on the page on Sunday evening said: "The weather next week is looking a little bit better than last. The winds look like they will be moderating a bit as temperatures drop. Snow is forecast every day with periods of heavy snow adding to the existing snow pack. "The team will try and get parties on the hill most days." Ms Slater and Mr Newton were thought to have been camping near the Charles Inglis Clark memorial hut on the north side of Ben Nevis. The alarm was raised a week ago when they failed to return. Searches on Saturday, involving more than 20 people and a rescue dog, had to be halted due to "increasingly hazardous weather", including high winds, falling snow and limited visibility. Meanwhile, over the weekend rescue teams found two male climbers who got into difficulty on Ben Nevis on Saturday. Brothers Rory and Leon Probert from Wales were located in the summit shelter, cold and wet, but otherwise unharmed.
