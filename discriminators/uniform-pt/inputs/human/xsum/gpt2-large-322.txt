 but by by April the following year the cancer was confirmed as terminal. "While I was trying to come to terms with the fact she was dying, I decided I wanted, or maybe needed, to document the time she had left," says Marchbank. But there was always that question as to whether it was the right thing to do. "I didn't want to create a graphic portrayal of her death - it would have been impossible and wrong to focus only on the dying part - but rather I wanted to photograph our last months together. "I looked at the things that made her uniquely her, the details in her house I thought I knew so well, the things that would also be gone when she was." This is a very personal thing. Others have documented such moments, each in their own way. For some the very idea of picking up a camera at such a time would seem taboo, for others a most natural response. Marchbank feels that the few seconds spent taking pictures each day gave her a way to record the moments that would come to mean so much. "Her love of flowers was a beautiful part of her personality; the house was always full of them, and as I photographed them I realised they were symbolic of what was happening - they represented happiness, love, kindness and generosity, but also isolation, decay, and finally death." The work is called Tulip, after her mother's favourite flower, and it is these small, often overlooked parts of her mother's life that form the narrative of the work. Marchbank found the editing process after her mother's death cathartic, and only now, five years on, is she ready to share the work with a wider audience through the publication of a book. Tulip has become about her own journey through grief. "Grief is like a grey cloud above your head, sometimes just a nagging doubt at the back of your mind, other times a huge storm cloud filling your whole mind. As long as I feel this grey cloud then, in a way, I will always feel her presence." Tulip by Celine Marchbank is published by Dewi Lewis.
