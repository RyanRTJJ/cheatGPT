 was stabbed to death and two others injured in London's Pentonville prison. The government says it will set out prison safety and reform plans soon. It has already announced an extra Â£10m to be spent on prison safety, and 400 extra staff are due to be deployed by March next year. In his speech, Prof Hardwick - chief inspector of prisons from 2010-16 - said homicide in prison had previously been rare at between one and three a year, but had risen to seven in 2015 and five so far this year. "I don't believe this recent increase is a coincidence," he said. "It is the most extreme example of the decline in safety that I... have been warning about for years." Given the loss of control, "ambitious plans to improve rehabilitation and education or tackle extremism are simply not achievable", he said. "I see no sign that the number of homicides, self-inflicted deaths, self-harm incidents and assaults will not continue to rise. "Politicians, policy-makers and senior managers need to think through very, very carefully and honestly the consequences of further deterioration and how this might end up," he added. He went on to say that the Prison Governors Association's call for an inquiry into the state of jails in England and Wales was "the last thing we need", as it would take years before any action was taken.
