 - including pedestrianisation of part of Broad Street - to be completed in 2017. The plans are being lodged later this month. The vision includes offices with 250 car spaces, civic spaces, a 125-bed four-star hotel, and restaurants. The full Marischal Square plans and images can be seen at Aberdeen Art Gallery on Friday and Saturday, then in the reception area of Marischal College from Monday until 17 April. Muse's regional director for Scotland, Steve Turner, said: "The Marischal Square proposal fulfils the vision of the city's Bon Accord master plan by providing a new civic square, creating a fitting setting for Marischal College, as well as delivering a vibrant new mixed-use development in keeping with Aberdeen's justifiable position as one of the UK's leading business destinations. "Marischal Square has the potential to make a long-term impact on the local economy and it is vital the city has the right mix of office and commercial space to capitalise on the opportunities that will arise. "We will be replacing the former St Nicholas House building with new office and commercial buildings that will respect the city's granite history and be no more than seven storeys high, and that again is something the public were keen to see reflected in Marischal Square." Deputy council leader Marie Boulton said: "The project has now reached a very exciting stage and I would encourage everyone who has a view on it to go along to the exhibition at the art gallery to see the plans, including the model of the scheme, for themselves. "There will also be an opportunity to view the information at Marischal College after the weekend. "Whatever your views on the Marischal Square proposals, I would encourage the Aberdeen public to make them known." In 2011, more than 1,000 council staff vacated the 14-storey St Nicholas House building, erected in 1968, for the newly-refurbished Marischal College building.
