A consultant at Great Ormond Street Hospital told the Gibsons last week that CBD trials had been carried out and the results would be published in the new year. However, Danielle believes that may not be soon enough for her daughter. She told the BBC that as Sophia gets older, she is more prone to Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) and that she worries every morning as she wakes Sophia up.
