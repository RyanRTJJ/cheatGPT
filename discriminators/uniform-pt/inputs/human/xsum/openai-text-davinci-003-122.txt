In a tweet, Mr Modi congratulated the scientists on the launch, saying he was "very proud of them". The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) took three years to build the satellite, which was launched by its reliable Geo-synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). The South Asia Satellite has 12 Ku band transponders which India's neighbours can use to improve their communications services. Each country will get access to at least one transponder, but they will have to develop their own ground infrastructure. The satellite is also capable of providing crucial communication links between the nations in times of natural disasters. Mr Modi has called this satellite an "invaluable gift" to India's neighbours. This "gift" from India has no parallels in the space-faring world. All other current regional consortia are commercial for-profit enterprises. So it seems Mr Modi is placing the ISRO in a new orbit by providing this space-based platform that would have cost the participating nations almost $1,500m (Â£1,158m).
