 the recommended annual checks and action taken against parts of the NHS with the worst record. The Department of Health said it wants to improve diabetes services. The charity obtained the figures by analysing data from the National Diabetes Audit. It showed that for type 1 diabetes, just 11% of people meet the targets which help prevent the risk of complications. High blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar suggest the patient's diabetes is not well controlled and can lead to complications such as kidney failure and stroke. The charity also said it goes a long way to explaining why 24,000 people with diabetes die early every year in England and Wales.

It is estimated that the NHS spends about Â£10bn a year on diabetes - 10% of its entire budget - and about 80% of this goes on treating complications that could often have been prevented. There are currently around three million people diagnosed with the disease. Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: "Given that diabetes is serious and can lead to early death if not supported to manage their condition, it is extremely worrying that so few people have it under control.
