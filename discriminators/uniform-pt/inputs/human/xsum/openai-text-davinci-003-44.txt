 in the last year, with a fall from 308 to 274. In England, the number of libraries fell from 3,142 to 3,076, while Scotland saw a drop from 573 to 567. The closures coincide with government funding cuts of £50m to UK library services in the past year, from £0.99bn in 2013-14 to £0.94bn in 2014-15.

Cipfa figures also showed library visits were down 3.9% from 276 million in the year 2013-14 to 265 million the following year. However Cipfa was unable to say if the drop was a direct result of a loss in services or whether other factors, such as an increased popularity in e-books, were a cause. A spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said that, despite the closures, there were still 225 million visits to libraries in England alone in the last year. They added there had also been a number of new libraries opened in the annual survey period. These included recently opened services in Stafford, West Midlands, and in Camberwell, south London.

That's why the government set up the Libraries Task Force to help them improve things like digital access and e-lending," the spokesperson said. "We have also made free wifi available in libraries around
