 the pace. Bottas spun at Turn Six while trying to improve and was lucky not to crash. The Red Bulls of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen took fourth and fifth ahead of Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari. And there was encouragement for McLaren, with Fernando Alonso eighth quickest using the upgraded engine that Honda have introduced for this race. The new Honda is reputed to be about 25bhp more powerful than the previous version of the engine - which still leaves it just under 70bhp down on the Mercedes. Media playback is not supported on this device Kevin Magnussen also impressed in the Haas, to end the session seventh fastest. Hamilton was quickest in both qualifying trim and on the race-simulation runs later in the session, when the cars run with a high fuel load, but his session was cut short because Mercedes needed to change a spark plug. The three-time champion missed about 15 minutes before being sent on his way again but complained over the radio that there was still a problem. He returned to the pits with 10 minutes of the session remaining and investigations began into the source of the problem. Despite his issue, Hamilton was comfortably quicker than both Bottas and Raikkonen when they were all doing race simulations on the ultra-soft tyre. But Bottas' times were not representative because he damaged the floor of his car with his spin and Mercedes did not replace it. Vettel did his race-simulation run on the super-soft tyre first so his times cannot be compared. The low-grip surface caused a lot of problems. Both Ferrari drivers spun, Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson did so twice, Alonso had a rare off-track moment and spin in Turn Six, and a number of drivers ran wide as they explored the limits of the cars on the slippery track. And Daniil Kvyat's session came to end with 10 minutes remaining as he was told to return to the pits with overheating brakes - which promptly caught fire in the pits.
