 Take this post from Facebook: "Left my mobile at home today. See lots of 'No Number' calls. Could be media wanting to know if I'm a 'Leaver' or 'Remainer'. I'm not answering questions like that until I speak with all Montgomeryshire party members who want to speak to me, and at least some constituents. "Not willing to make this important announcement without discussing with them first. So don't bother ring to ask for a week or two. Ok, I won't then. Mr Davies voted "out" in the 1975 referendum and is widely expected to vote the same way this time. Two other Welsh Conservative MPs declared on Monday, as the prime minister was questioned by MPs on his deal. James Davies took to Facebook to announce he would vote to leave. Wales Office Minister Alun Cairns, who is no fan of the EU and spent some time "grappling" with the issue, said he would vote to remain. So the scores on the doors confirm that four Welsh Tory MPs will vote to leave, with six voting to stay (and Glyn Davies still to declare). All 25 Welsh Labour MPs will vote to stay in the EU, as will Welsh Liberal Democrat Mark Williams and the three Plaid Cymru MPs. Plaid's parliamentary leader, Hywel Williams, had his least confrontational exchange with the prime minister in the House of Commons, asking David Cameron "what would happen to convergence funding which has provided large amounts of money for the poorer areas of West Wales and the Valleys?" The PM told him: "If we were to leave the EU then we wouldn't be able to get those funds which have made a big difference in parts of Wales, parts of England, for instance in Cornwall and in other parts of our country." Those who favour "Brexit" argue that with Britain a net contributor to the EU the grants from Brussels could be replaced by cash direct from Westminster.
