 the service, which also includes an anthem by Judith Weir, Master of the Queen's Music. Both Sir David and Bond also turned 90 this year. Weir's anthem will be sung by St Paul's Cathedral Choir and its text is the poem I love all beauteous things, by Robert Bridges, who was poet laureate in the year the Queen was born. Pianist Martin James Bartlett - 2014's BBC Young Musician of the Year - will play Burlesque by Arnold Bax, who was George VI's last Master of the King's Music and the Queen's first Master of the Queen's Music. Organ music before the service will include Flourish for an Occasion by William Harris, who taught the Queen how to play the piano. Guests at the service include the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and Prime Minister David Cameron. Mr Cameron will read from the New Testament and the Archbishop of Canterbury will preach the sermon, which will be heard by other guests including politicians past and present, diplomats and governors general. Broadcaster Clare Balding, who has an association with the Queen as three generations of her family have trained horses for her, will also be present. It will be a national service of thanksgiving, part of a number of formal celebrations being held in June. On 11 June - the Queen's official birthday - the annual Trooping the Colour will be held on Horse Guards Parade. The birthday parade will end with members of the Royal Family making their annual appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, where they will see a flypast by the Royal Air Force. The following day, the Queen will then host a street party for some 10,000 people at the Patron's Lunch - a celebration of her patronage of more than 600 organisations in the UK and around the Commonwealth.
