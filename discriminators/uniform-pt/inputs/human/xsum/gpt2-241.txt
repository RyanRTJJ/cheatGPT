The fire service said 15 people were rescued from the four-storey property after a blaze in a basement flat spread at about 04:10 on Sunday. About 25 firefighters tackled the blaze.

"We were sleeping, me and my son, and the lower window in our basement was just outside the house that actually caught fire so there was smoke coming inside where we were sleeping." Ten residents of the flats were taken to a council rest centre until it is safe for them to return home.

The cause of the fire is unknown and a joint investigation between the fire service and
