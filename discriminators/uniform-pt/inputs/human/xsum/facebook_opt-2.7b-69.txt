 will next week discuss multimillion-pound proposals to redevelop the gardens. The 140-year-old Ross Fountain would also be restored. It is part of plan by city hotelier Norman Springford, who has offered to help finance the project. Mr Springford, who owns four Apex hotels in the capital, said: "Whilst it has been a personal ambition to see redevelopment, the opportunity for this to become a reality arises from a real spirit of public/private co-operation. "I'm sure we are all looking forward to being given the chance to deliver a project which the city can have pride in." Members of the council's corporate policy and strategy committee will be asked to consider the feasibility of the project at a meeting on Tuesday. The next stage would see the publication of a report for consideration by the full council. The plans would then go to the Scottish government as the Ross Bandstand is on common ground. The Ross Bandstand venue was developed as a venue in 1935 and has a capacity of 2,400. The original facility dates back to 1877, gifted to Edinburgh by William Henry Ross, chairman of the Distillers Company Ltd. Andrew Burns, City of Edinburgh Council's leader, said: "Scores of famous acts have graced the Ross Bandstand stage and while it remains a key venue for the city's famous festival fireworks and hogmanay concert in the Gardens, it is more than 80 years old and is nearing the end of its useful life. "It has been a long-held ambition of the council to create a new facility as part of major renewal of the gardens but is not, in the current financial climate, a project we could undertake alone. "We are extremely grateful to Mr Springford for his personal commitment to the project. "Princes Street Gardens are a major source of residents' pride in the city and it is important that we get any changes to the park right."
