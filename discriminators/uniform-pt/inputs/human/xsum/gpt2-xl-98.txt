Mr Combs was the third white police officer indicted in 2014 in a shooting of an unarmed black man in the state. And his indictment came amid two similar US high-profile cases in which officers were not charged. The failure of grand juries to indict white police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, over the deaths of black men caused nationwide protests. The shooting in South Carolina came in 2011 after Mr Bailey visited Eutawville town hall to complain about a traffic citation his daughter had received six weeks earlier for a broken tail-light. Mr Combs attempted to arrest Bailey on an obstruction of justice charge. Mr Bailey left the town hall and Mr Combs pursued him back to his vehicle. Mr Pascoe said Mr Bailey was then "gunned down in an absolutely senseless act of violence" and shot three times as he simply backed out to escape an escalating situation.
