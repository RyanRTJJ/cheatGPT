People are most likely to come across sheep ticks, which feed on mammals and birds, in open spaces with long grass or bracken.

In May, the European Space Agency gave Â£180,000 to a project to test a new app mapping tick hotspots. NHS Highland, the University of the Highlands and Islands and Scotland's Rural College are involved in the initiative which will test the LymeMap app. People out walking or cycling have been asked to use the app to upload information about where they find ticks. Using GPS technology, the application also gathers details such as the height, temperature and vegetation cover of the location where a person uploads their information. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread to humans by infected ticks. Flu-like symptoms and fatigue are often the first noticeable signs of infection. Diagnosed cases of Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics, but, if left untreated, neurological
