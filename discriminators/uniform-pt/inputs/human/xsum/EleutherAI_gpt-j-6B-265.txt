Other apparent search anomalies include the blocking of the term circumcision but not of FGM (female genital mutilation), suicide but not self-harm, the actress Pamela Anderson but not Fifty Shades of Grey.

In case some bad words are present in a search query, our guard robot will block the search," Kiddle states on its website. The site
