degree depraved heart murder, the most serious charge against the six police officers accused of causing Mr Gray's death. Mr Goodson's lawyer has argued Mr Gray's death was accidental. Mr Gray was arrested in April 2015 for running away from police officers unprovoked. He died a week after sustaining a spinal injury in the back of a police van. Mr Gray's death sparked civil unrest in Baltimore amid a national debate on police brutality and the death of unarmed black men at the hands of police. Prosecutor Michael Schatzow argued on Thursday that Mr Goodson was negligent when he failed to use the seat belt to secure Mr Gray, who was handcuffed and shackled. Mr Goodson intentionally took sharp turns to allow Mr Gray to be thrown around, according to the prosecutor. But Andrew Graham, Mr Goodson's defence attorney, contends the death was caused by a "freakish accident," adding that Mr Gray violently kicked and screamed. He also argues his client drove cautiously. The van made six stops on the way from Mr Gray's arrest to the police station. Mr Goodson was the only officer present at each of the stops. Before the opening statements were made on Thursday, Baltimore Circuit Judge Barry Williams rebuked prosecutors for allegedly withholding evidence and violating discovery rules. Prosecutors failed to submit defence material from an interview in May 2015 with Donta Allen, who was put in a separate van compartment after Mr Gray's arrest. Mr Williams did not dismiss the cases, but ordered prosecutors to turn in any potentially exculpatory evidence obtained in the interview by Monday. Mr Goodson, who is also charged with three counts of manslaughter, faces 30 years in prison if convicted. He is the third officer to face trial over Mr Gray's death. Last month, Officer Edward Nero was acquitted of all charges. Officer William Porter's trial ended in a hung jury and is slated for a retrial.
