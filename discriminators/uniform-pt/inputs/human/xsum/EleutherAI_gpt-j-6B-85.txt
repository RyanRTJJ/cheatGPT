 off a balcony at Mr Munkley's Caia Park estate flat in Wrexham last October. Mr Roberts, 33, and Mr Munkley, 53, both deny murder. His wife, Gwenythe Munkley, 55, denies helping her husband evade arrest. Mr Roberts said he was at Mr Munkley's flat because he believed cannabis was due to be delivered. He told the court Mr Davies arrived and Mr Munkley said he would get the money and went to his bedroom. But he returned with a crossbow and shot Mr Davies, he claimed. Mr Roberts said he had nothing to do with the killing himself. The prosecution say Mr Davies was stabbed and slashed with knives, shot with a crossbow, and was pushed or fell three storeys from the flat. Mr Munkley has claimed Mr Roberts was not there and previously told the court the attack was carried out by a Geordie man he did not know. He has denied owing Mr Davies money. Mr Roberts told the jury he used cannabis daily but was not a minder for Mr Munkley and was not involved in his cannabis business. He said: "They [Mr Munkley and Mr Davies] were arguing about money, Munkley was going mad and was saying money he had given him to pay for drugs had gone missing." Mr Roberts said he broke up fighting between them, but Mr Munkley then shot Mr Davies twice with a crossbow. He said Mr Davies ran onto the balcony, jumped over the railings and began to slide down. "I grabbed his arm and tried to pull him back up, but I couldn't," he said. Mr Roberts said he had identified himself on mobile phone footage, previously shown to the jury, which showed him holding a knife in his hand at the scene. He said he picked the knife up for his own protection and did not see Mr Davies injured with a knife or knives. The trial continues.
