 Eilat, Israel. Heather Watson then beat Sofia Shapatava 6-2 6-0 to ensure Britain top Pool B in Europe/Africa Group 1. Britain will play Belgium in Saturday's play-off. Another victory there would see Judy Murray's side progress to a World Group II play-off in April, and the possibility of a first home tie for Britain's women since 1993. In the four years since Murray took over the captaincy they have twice come through Europe/Africa Group 1, only to lose away ties against Sweden in 2012 and Argentina in 2013. Murray's hopes were dealt a blow before the tournament started this year when Australian Open semi-finalist and British number one Johanna Konta withdrew because of illness, prompting the captain to call on Swan. The US-based teenager made her Fed Cup debut on Thursday with a victory against South Africa, but Gorgodze - ranked 197 places higher than the Briton - was a significant step up in class. The Georgian broke serve at the first opportunity for a 2-0 lead but Swan then took 10 of the next 12 games to build a decisive advantage. Leading 6-3 4-1, Swan held off a fightback and saved break points before closing it out after one hour and 31 minutes. Watson, ranked 85th, was far too strong for world number 226 Sofia Shapatava in the second singles match
