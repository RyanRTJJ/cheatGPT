 clinical trials. Cancer Research UK says this type of study offers new insights into cancer. The study focused on Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) - there are around 3,000 new cases every year in the UK. The disease is often aggressive, particularly in older patients - overall survival after five years is about 20%. Treatment is predominantly chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation but for many patients it can be difficult to tell how they will respond. Clinicians currently rely on checks for chromosomal abnormalities and analysis under a microscope. In this study - involving more than 1,500 patients - researchers carried out a far more detailed genetic analysis of the cancer. They looked at more than 100 genes known to cause leukaemia, and investigated how they interacted. They found the patients divided into at least 11 major groups, each with their own set of genetic changes and clinical features. Dr Peter Campbell from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, who co-led
