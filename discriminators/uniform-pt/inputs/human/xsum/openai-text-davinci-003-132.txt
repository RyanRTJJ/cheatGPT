 manager a year ago. An MSP has now passed evidence of the practice to the UK employment minister. Thousands of people have lost their jobs since the oil downturn began. Concerns have now been raised that some companies and recruiting agencies are actively excluding candidates from the sector. Mr McIntyre said: "Explicitly I was told 'we are not interested in people from oil and gas at the moment. You'll just go back up to Aberdeen when the recovery starts'. "I would just like people to see beyond the title and look at the skill set. "I think a lot of people will be surprised how much skills and experience people in oil and gas have." Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin has written to UK Employment Minister Damian Hinds. She says she has seen "documentary evidence" of some level of discrimination against former oil and gas workers and she now wants an investigation into how widespread this is. She wrote: "Many people who have lost their jobs in the oil and gas sector have been trying to find employment in other sectors of the economy. "Examples suggest that companies are discriminating against these workers, regardless of their skills, based only on their past involvement in the oil and gas industry." Scotland's Employment Minister Jamie Hepburn, who was also contacted, said: "These claims are deeply concerning and its absolutely right that Gillian Martin has raised this with the UK government, which has responsibility in this area.
