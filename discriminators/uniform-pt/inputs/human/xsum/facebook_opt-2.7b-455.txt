 the increase it plans to close Walsall Museum and reduce children's services spending by £500,000. The cuts are part of an overall five-year budget reduction of £100m. Two years ago the council announced 430 redundancies in a bid to save £23.5m. Facing further budget reductions for 2014-2015, council leader Mike Bird said: "It is clear there will be less money, fewer people and so we'll be able to do less. "We expect more job losses but it would be wrong to ask us to speculate on a figure." The council's overall budget for next year is £620m. Details of how that could be spent have been released based on no increase in council tax. But the council is also asking residents whether they would pay more tax "to protect more services".

It would also reduce the children's services budget by £500,000, with a further £450,000 cut possible after a review of youth support and careers information. A further £480,000 could be saved by re-negotiating a respite care contract and £500,000 could be taken from the residential care budget. Almost £300,000 could be cut from family support spending and £165,000 could be raised by increasing charges for bereavement services. Grants to allotment associations could be cut by 50% to save about £20,000. Councillor Christopher Towe, portfolio holder for finance, said "tough decisions lie ahead" but the council's priorities lie with helping businesses to create jobs, promoting good health, providing safe environments and supporting children. The proposals will go before a council cabinet meeting on 23 October and residents are urged to
