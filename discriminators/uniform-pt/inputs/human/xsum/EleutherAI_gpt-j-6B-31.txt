 the rest of his career and that the BBC will cover it every step of the way is a huge boost," said tournament director Stephen Farrow. I'm really happy to know that I will play at Queen's for as long as my career lasts Murray, 29, won at Queen's last year en route to becoming the world number one. His victory in the 2016 final against Milos Raonic was watched by 3.7m on TV, with many more listening on Radio 5 live and following online on the BBC Sport website. Barbara Slater, director of BBC Sport, described the tournament as "one of the most cherished events in the tennis calendar". "It's great that the BBC will continue to bring it to audiences across all platforms until 2024," she added. "With a British tennis player as the current world number one, there's no better time for us to reinforce our commitment to the sport."

He followed it up weeks later by claiming his second Wimbledon title, while his second Olympic gold medal followed later in the summer. He secured the year-end world number one ranking with victory at the ATP World Tour Finals before being named the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for a third time. He was subsequently knighted in the the New Year Honours. "I'm really happy to know that I will play at Queen's for as long as my career lasts," said Murray. "My first ATP World Tour match-win came at Queen's in 2005, so for it to become by far the most successful tournament of my career is a great feeling. "Looking at the names that have won the tournament four times, [they are] some of the best players ever. Winning it five times means a lot to me."
