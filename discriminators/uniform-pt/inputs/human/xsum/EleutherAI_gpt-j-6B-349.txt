 funding in place". Bids are expected to be made for government and European money, but local businesses could also make an "increased contribution". This could take the form of additional "ring-fenced" taxation on businesses or additional business rates, Birmingham City Council said. Jerry Blackett, chief executive of Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce, said transport had been a "key issue" for the city and that "inner-city travelling is fraught with congestion and poor public transit coverage". He said businesses needed "clarity" on how the plan would be funded and that "blunt instruments" such as a parking levy - a tax on firms with parking spaces - could "stifle economic growth" in the city. The council said it would also look at the "long-term future" of the A38 through the city centre, including closing existing tunnels and sending traffic along a "substantially upgraded ring road". Sir Albert Bore, leader of Birmingham City Council, said that could take the form of joining up the tunnels or even creating a motorway under the city. Dr Pat Hanlon, a transport expert at the University of Birmingham, said a "supertunnel" could not only improve congestion, but open up parts of the city for building, allowing key areas such as Great Charles Street and the Colmore business district to be joined up. Dr Hanlon said in terms of transport Birmingham had "lost an awful lot of ground to Manchester" in particular. More than one million car journeys were made into Birmingham each day, the council said, and the current public transport system meant commuters had "no real alternative" to driving. The council estimated by 2031 there could be an additional 80,000 cars in the city if nothing was done. The council also wants to reopen and upgrade rail routes to Moseley, Kings Heath and Sutton Coldfield, with new stations at Fort Parkway and Castle Vale. A low emissions zone is planned for the city centre, with incentives for taxis and buses to switch to electric power.
