 National Anthem Bill to Parliament on 13 January. If MPs voted in favour, a public consultation would be held to choose a song. The Labour MP said: "I have nothing against God Save the Queen but that is the national anthem of the United Kingdom. "England is a component part of the UK but it competes as a country in its own right and I think a song that celebrated England rather than Britain would be more appropriate." Mr Perkins said he was proud to be both English and British but they were "not the same thing". His proposed new law would bestow a responsibility on the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to hold a consultation. All relevant sporting bodies would be instructed to use the chosen anthem prior to international sporting contests, at medal awarding ceremonies and whenever else a national anthem was required for teams or athletes representing England. God Save the Queen would continue to be used for teams or individuals representing Great Britain or the UK. "I hope that Scots and Welsh will also recognise this not as an anti-union move, but a pro-union one," said Mr Perkins. "By recognising that England is a component part of the union but a different entity, I think this strengthens both our Englishness but also reminds us all of what the union is." Liberal Democrat MP Greg Mulholland raised the same issue in Parliament in 2010. Prime Minister David Cameron has said that Jerusalem would be his choice for England's national anthem, according to the ConservativeHome website. Jerusalem was chosen as the anthem to be played for English athletes competing at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi following a month-long public vote. Voters were able to choose from three songs, and Jerusalem beat both the UK national anthem and the anthem previously used for English athletes competing at Commonwealth Games. Jerusalem drew 52.5% of the votes Land of Hope and Glory was voted for by 32.5% God Save The Queen was voted for by 12% Survey by YouGov of 1,896 entrants
