 Jalal, for one goal, did not help matters, but Mills insists the problem is at the other end. "I thought the lads did well. We had a good shape and we worked hard, but we are struggling up-front," said Mills. "We've got a situation where we want to address the striker situation and it's not possible to do that. "Unfortunately we did not look like scoring a goal again. We need the striker situation to change. We need more up top." He said a number of players had left the club in the summer in search of better deals and the club had been unable to stop them.
