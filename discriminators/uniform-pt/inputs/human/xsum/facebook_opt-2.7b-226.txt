 its tracker device leading the team to a Northamptonshire field but "Major Tom", as it has been named, had gone. A reward has been offered by owner Rob Wisdom, of Essex, who wants to recover a camera that filmed the flight. More down to earth news from Northamptonshire The space flight - which used a modified original space capsule for the doll and a parachute to help it back to earth - was the brainchild of Chris Hillcox, from Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands. A keen Action Man fan, he got in touch with fellow collector Mr Wisdom, and said: "I want to put an Action Man into space for his 50th anniversary year, and I know how to do it." Mr Wisdom and Mr Hillcox - who runs a near-space photography business - used a crowdfunding site to raise more than Â£3,000 to fund the "Mercury 10" mission, named after the NASA Mercury missions of the 1950s and 60s. They used a vintage doll and modified its space suit and original capsule to include sponsors' names. The launch took place from a field next to the old Palitoy Factory in Coalville - where Action Man toys were made under licence from Hasbro. "He was sent off with a helium balloon from his spiritual home, 50 years after his birth," Mr Wisdom said. However, when Major Tom fell to earth in Creaton, 75 minutes later, someone snapped up the orange balloon, the doll, capsule and the on-board camera, within 20 minutes. "The sad thing is we won't get to see what it was like up there as that is all on the camera," Mr Wisdom said. Also missing were 100 brass dog tags, which had been minted as gifts for the project backers. "We're hoping a child just found the capsule as it was near a play area, and thought Christmas had come early," Mr Wisdom said. "Hopefully, their mum will see the #Findmajortom posts on
