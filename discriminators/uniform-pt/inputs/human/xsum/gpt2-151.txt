 to ensure safe healthcare provision when considering new developments, it said. The Scottish government wants to see 50,000 affordable homes by 2021. It said it was considering recommendations from an independent planning review report relating to infrastructure. Plans to build 1,000 new council houses were announced by North Lanarkshire Council in August. And earlier this month Springfield Properties revealed plans to build 1,700 new homes at 13 sites across Scotland. However the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) claims major developments could have a "direct impact" on GP surgeries in the areas concerned.

"Many GPs simply do not have the capacity to deal with larger lists of patients. "What appears to be good news for housing could have disastrous implications for the healthcare service." He said that each new home was likely to house at least two people. The average size of a household in Scotland is 2.19, according to the 2011 census. Dr Mack added: "What consideration has been given to the capacity of the existing local GP practices? "Clearly, these people will mostly already be accommodated elsewhere but at a time when practices are restricting their lists across the country it is absolutely crucial that serious thought be given to the services for patients once they arrive in their new area.

Until they do, patients face uncertainty with the possibility of their practices simply buckling under added pressures." Earlier this week the Scottish government came under fire after it emerged that Scotland will face a shortfall of 830 GPs in 2020. It emerged in June that one in five GP surgeries in Scotland has a vacancy. The Scottish government's planning minister, Kevin
