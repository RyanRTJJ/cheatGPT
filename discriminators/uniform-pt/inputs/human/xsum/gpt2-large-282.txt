225 Super Puma crashed in the North Sea after picking up passengers from an oil platform. Thirteen people died - 11 Norwegians, a Briton and an Italian. Some of the victims' families have chosen not to identify them publicly. The Briton has been named as Iain Stuart, from Laurencekirk in Aberdeenshire.

Mr Halvorsen confirmed that the crew had no time to send an emergency message before the crash. He told Norway's VG website that there had been less than one second between the fault appearing and the helicopter's flight recorder coming to a halt. The recorder is thought to have stopped working when the rotor became detached. But he stressed that the investigation - in which British and French experts are participating - was at an early stage and no conclusions could yet be drawn. The Super Pumas remain grounded in both Norway and the UK, though their manufacturer, Airbus, said on Monday that it was no longer recommending a blanket ban on their use. It insists the fleet is safe. The Offshore Co-ordinating Group, which co-ordinates trade union policy and campaigns in the oil and gas sector, released a statement calling for the H225 helicopter to be grounded until the
