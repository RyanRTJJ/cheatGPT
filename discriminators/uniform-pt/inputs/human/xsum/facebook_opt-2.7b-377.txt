 the New York Times show Milwaukee has seen the biggest rise, with a 76% increase. It is followed by St Louis, Missouri, which has seen a 60% increase, and Baltimore, Maryland, with a 56% rise. Some senior police officials say that heightened scrutiny of use of force by officers may have caused them to withdraw from everyday policing and emboldened criminals. But others say an increase in gun ownership, a spike in gang-related killings and more young people settling disputes with guns may be contributing factors. While it is unclear what has led to the sharp increase, some say it can be attributed to "the Ferguson effect" - the theory that police officers have been withdrawing from everyday enforcement due to fears they could be charged. It follows a nationwide debate over the police's use of force and race relations in the wake of the fatal shooting of black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, last year. But others argue that while this may be the case for some local populations in St Louis and Baltimore where racial tensions have been high, it does not explain the nationwide surge. Violent crimes are mostly driven by social factors such as the size of the youth population, the amount of socioeconomic disadvantage and social disorganisation in a given city.
