 The Voice UK moved from the BBC to ITV after the last series. Both shows peaked with 6.9 million viewers. Let It Shine aims to find cast members for a new Take That musical. The Voice UK saw the return of Sir Tom Jones, who was dropped by the BBC from its version of the show in 2015. He was joined by fellow coaches will.i.am, Jennifer Hudson and Gavin Rossdale as they listened to contestants hoping to win a record contract. The Let It Shine judges, alongside Barlow, are Dannii Minogue and Martin Kemp. They were joined for the auditions by guest judge and former Glee actress Amber Riley, who is currently starring in the West End stage show of Dreamgirls. Other guest judges on the show, presented by former Great British Bake Off host Mel Giedroyc and comedian Graham Norton, will include pop veteran Lulu. Barlow has previously said the success of his new show should not be judged on TV ratings because they are less relevant than they used to be. The Voice UK gave a boost to ITV's Saturday night viewing figures, with only 3.2 million tuning in during the same slot on the channel last year. But the opener was slightly down on the debut show for the last BBC series, which attracted an average of 7.1m viewers on 9 January last year. However, the latter had its smallest ever audience for a final last April, with 4.5 million watching, compared with 6.3 million the previous year. Audiences for TV singing contests have been in decline for a number of years. December's The X Factor final was the least watched in the show's history and lost out in the ratings to BBC One's Planet Earth II, which was shown at the same time.
