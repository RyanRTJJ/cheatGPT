It added that Canadian officials were seeking access to Mr Lim. Mr Lim was sentenced after a 90-minute trial at the North Korean Supreme Court.

Mr Lim and his colleagues travelled to Pyongyang on 31 January as part of a humanitarian mission. His family said it was to support a nursing home, nursery and orphanage. Mr Lim, who heads the Light Korean Presbyterian Church, had made numerous humanitarian aid missions to North Korea for nearly two decades, the Church said. He was detained in February and in July a KCNA report said Mr Lim had given a press conference in Pyongyang where he admitted to using humanitarian work as a "guise" for "subversive plots and activities in a sinister bid to build a religious state". He also reportedly admitted to giving lectures that "North Korea should be collapsed with the love of 'God'", and to helping the US and South Korea to aid North Korean defectors.
