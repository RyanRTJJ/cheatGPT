 to a new low. In the previous week, only 77.2% of patients were seen within four hours. The Scottish government target is for 95% to be seen and either admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours. Scottish Labour said a total of 3,852 patients had spent more than four hours in A&E since the hospital opened. The party's public services spokeswoman, Jackie Baillie, said: "NHS staff in Scotland work incredibly hard to deliver the care that Scots need, but it is clear that even at the new £850m flagship hospital things are going wrong. "Just last week we saw the hospital needing urgent specialist support for the second time in just four months. "It's clear that the hospital hasn't been getting the long-term resources it needs from the SNP government. "The hospital struggled to hit the SNP's A&E waiting time target in the middle of summer and autumn - the problems at the hospital need to be fixed now before winter comes. "Scottish Labour asked SNP Health Minister Shona Robison back in May to consider pausing the transfer of patients to ease the burden on the new hospital, but she said no. "Now we see thousands of patients waiting longer than they should have to for care. It's just not good enough and SNP ministers must get a grip." The £842m facility, formerly known as the South Glasgow University Hospital, started taking patients in April. Dubbed a "super-hospital", the campus replaced the Royal Hospital for Sick Kids at Yorkhill, the Southern General Hospital, the Western and Victoria infirmaries and the Mansionhouse Unit.

In June, the Scottish government announced that a team of experts would be sent in to help staff improve A&E waiting times at the site. Performance rose
