 he strangled Ms Parker after she called him "gay" for wanting to do her hair. Nolan, 48, was ordered to spend a minimum of 18 years in jail. Ms Parker was killed in Heywood, Greater Manchester, in August 2015. The trial heard how, after strangling her, father-of-four Nolan bundled her body into the boot of his blue Nissan car. He later bragged to a man he was trying to buy cannabis from that he had killed a woman. Police said that when the man "expressed his disbelief", Nolan "pulled one of the rear seats in the car down and revealed Katelyn's body". Following a tip-off, officers spotted the car driving on Claybank Street in Heywood the following day. After a short pursuit Nolan abandoned the car behind a pub on Bamford Road and attempted to flee before he was detained nearby. The car was then searched and Ms Parker's body found. Nolan and the other man were both arrested on suspicion of murder. No further action was taken against the 70-year-old man. A post-mortem examination confirmed Ms Parker died from ligature strangulation. After the sentencing, senior investigating officer Duncan Thorpe, of Greater Manchester Police, said: "What happened to Katelyn was a tragedy and her friends and family went through something that nobody ever should. "I know the sentence passed here today won't change what happened but I hope it will go some way to giving them all some form of closure." In a statement at the time of her death, Ms Parker's family paid tribute to her, saying: "Katelyn was a loving and special person. "She saw the best in everybody and was happiest when spending time with her friends and family. "Katelyn was a vibrant and sociable young woman with a big heart and an even bigger smile. "She will leave a void in all our lives and her death under such tragic circumstances is something that we will never be able to come to terms with."
