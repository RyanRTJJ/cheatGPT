 and then blackmailed. A warrant has now been issued for the arrest of Archie Gian Tolin in the Philippines. The Crown Office wants to see him face trial in Scotland. In 2014 he was arrested and bailed in the Philippines along with many others as part of an operation by British and Filipino police into organised gangs said to have been involved in cyber-crime. Mr Perry was said to have believed he was talking to an American girl online. However, he was then understood to have been told by blackmailers the conversations had been recorded and would be shared with friends and family unless he paid them money. Inquiries by detectives from Police Scotland revealed an online trail, which led to the Philippines and links to organised crime groups there. The extradition move is thought to be the first since a new treaty came into force between the UK and the Philippines. A Crown Office spokesman said: "A warrant has been issued for the arrest of Archie Gian Tolin in connection with the death of Daniel Perry. "Steps are now being taken to enforce that warrant and secure his extradition from the Philippines." After the initial operation in the Philippines, Police Scotland warned there was "no hiding place" for those involved in extortion and blackmail. Det Ch Insp Gary Cunningham said: "Following the death of Daniel Perry, Police Scotland has continued its inquiries along with a number of other agencies including Interpol and the authorities within the Philippines. "A 20-year-old man is now subject to an international arrest warrant in connection with this investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time." Speaking in 2014, Mr Perry's mother, Nicola Perry, said: "The manner of Daniel's death is every parent's worst nightmare. "Losing Daniel has left us all devastated and we are still trying to come to terms with what has happened."
