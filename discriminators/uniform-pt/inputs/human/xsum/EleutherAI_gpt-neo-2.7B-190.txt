 measures have been put in place for the three-day final. The GB team delayed travelling to Belgium because of the security alert. Britain's squad of Andy Murray, Jamie Murray, Kyle Edmund, Dominic Inglot and James Ward arrived on Monday after postponing their Sunday flight, and were due to practise for the first time on Monday afternoon. They will have very tight security as they travel between the court and their hotel. Belgian police arrested 16 people in anti-terror raids during Sunday's lockdown and a further five subsequently, but a suspected gunman from the Paris attacks, Salah Abdeslam, remains at large. The sport's governing body, the International Tennis Federation, said it was "greatly concerned" by the terror threats affecting Brussels and was "closely monitoring the situation". Soldiers were patrolling Brussels' streets on Monday and many businesses and public services remained closed. Latest updates from BBC News Gijs Kooken, chief executive of the Flemish Tennis Federation (FTF), which is staging the event, told BBC Sport he was in regular contact with the Belgian government and had "not yet had a signal that it's not safe to organise the event". The final, which runs from Friday, 27 November to Sunday, 29 November, will be played on clay courts at the 13,000-seat Flanders Expo, with more than 1,000 British fans due to attend. Fans have been warned that entry into the arena will take longer than usual and they will not be allowed to take in food or drink. Sniffer dogs and explosive experts will be patrolling the venue, and spectators - who can expect to be body searched - will have to leave all bags in lockers outside the entrance. Great Britain, who last won the event in 1936, reached the final for the first time since 1978 with victory over Australia, while Belgium are competing in their first final in 111 years after beating Argentina.
