Traffic police drove at the dog on the dual carriageway between Llanfairfechan roundabout and the Conwy tunnel. North Wales Police said firearms officers were sent to the scene, but there was concern they would not be able to get a safe shot. The force added the dog had gone missing from a hunt, which was in the area at the weekend, and its owner was being "actively sought". The case has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Ch Insp Darren Wareing, of the roads policing unit, said police had not taken the decision to kill the dog lightly and it came after an officer was bitten while trying to bring the animal under control. One car and a HGV had to swerve to avoid the dog running towards traffic, he said. He said the "potential for a serious collision was present throughout" and there was "no alternative way" for them to minimise risks to motorists. "The only safe option was to run the dog over at sufficient speed to ensure that it was destroyed and would not suffer. Other methods of destruction were considered, but were ruled out on the grounds of public safety," he added. "Both officers have their own dogs and did not take this decision lightly. Due to the seriousness of the incident it needed bringing to a conclusion quickly for the safety of all concerned." North Wales PCC, Mr Roddick, said: "These were highly unusual circumstances and it was a difficult judgement to make, especially as I understand both officers concerned are dog owners themselves. "I will be raising the matter with the force and I will be asking a number of questions because it is important to ensure the matter is looked into fully." Charity People for the
