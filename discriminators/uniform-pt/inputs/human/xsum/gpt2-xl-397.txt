, before the tour to play Tonga and Samoa in June. "Those lads will come into the campaign bouncing and it's important we learn off them," said the Harlequins centre. "We've seen the way they play - the way they've attacked they've done pretty well." Roberts, 30, who has won 91 Wales caps, believes that Scarlets winning the Pro12 will provide a positive boost to the whole squad. "I'm stoked for the Scarlets lads. It's not easy to win a domestic title and they've achieved something quite remarkable," Roberts added. "Everyone in Welsh rugby is hugely proud of them - even as a Cardiff lad I'm saying that! "So it's important they feed into what we're trying to achieve here. "Test rugby is a bit different to domestic rugby. There are subtle differences there, but certainly those lads can come in and give us a lot of energy and smiles on faces." The match against Welsh Premiership side RGC 1404 is part of a six-day training camp in north Wales before the squad fly to the southern hemisphere to play Tonga on 17 June and Samoa on 24 June. "It's a fantastic occasion, not just for us, but more importantly for rugby here in north Wales," Roberts said. "It's a sell-out weeks ago for this match. I know how much support there is for rugby up here and Welsh rugby in general, having been up here before the World Cup in 2015. "To come here again and play at Parc Eirias it's very special and certainly I'll make sure the lads know that. "It's a great, great occasion for RGC.
