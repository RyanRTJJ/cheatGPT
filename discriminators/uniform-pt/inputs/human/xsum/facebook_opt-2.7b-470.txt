 as the "secrecy" surrounding the move. Some staff at the college have praised her and claim she is being treated unfairly - others had concerns about how the college was run. Ms Walsh's disciplinary hearing is scheduled to take place this month. The petition calls on Education Secretary Angela Constance to "make a speedy decision and bring to light the secrecy surrounding the suspension and bring this situation to an end". Some claim she had a robust management style but others praise her performance and dedication and deny there was a culture of bullying in the workplace. However a staff survey suggested 24% had experienced a culture of bullying within the organisation. One member of staff told BBC Scotland that staff and students had been given no information about what was happening and the reason for the principal's suspension had never been made public. They said: "The board of management's disdain for its duty of care to students and staff is quite staggering." The employee, who asked not to be named, claimed requests for information were either being blocked or ignored. They also claimed that student leaders and others who had asked for information since the suspension had faced bullying and intimidation. It is always difficult for employers to make public comments in situations like this because of their duty of care towards the people who are affected. Glasgow Clyde College was established two years ago from the merger of three separate colleges in the city. It employs about 1,000 people. It was created as part of a process which has seen colleges across Scotland merge into so-called "regional super colleges". In Glasgow there are now three separate large colleges. Questions have also been asked about the board, which takes responsibility for them following the resignation of its chairman - the former first minister Henry McLeish - and some other board members. Across the whole of Scotland, college budgets have been cut and more than 1,000 jobs have gone.
