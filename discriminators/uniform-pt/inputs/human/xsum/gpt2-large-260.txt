 law earlier this month and Australia has had plain packaging in place since 2012. Westminster's move follows a series of public consultations on the issue. The government announced in 2011 it would be considering the issue and ran a consultation in 2012. But then it appeared the government had gone cool on the plan, prompting accusations it had been influenced by the tobacco industry, before another review of the public health benefits was ordered.

Health campaigners have long been pushing for the move, saying it will help save lives. Alison Cox, of Cancer Research UK, said there was a "growing weight of evidence" that it would have an impact.

The regulations were discussed and agreed by a committee earlier this week and will now be subject to a free vote. But as it is not primary legislation, there will be no further debate.
