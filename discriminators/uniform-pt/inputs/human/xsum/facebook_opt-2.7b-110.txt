 and given up for adoption. Mrs Appleby has pursued her case through the Spanish legal system without success. "The last appeal that we did was to the constitutional tribunal," she said. "When that was rejected that was considered there was no where else we could go, so it opened the door for us to the European Court of Human Rights." More on this and other North Yorkshire stories Mrs Appleby, from Catterick Garrison, gave birth at a hospital in La Coruna in northern Spain where she was living at the time. The following day she was told her child had died. When she returned to the UK in 2010 she had her daughter's remains exhumed for cremation but said the skeleton she saw in the coffin appeared to be that of a much older infant. The following year she learned of the scandal of stolen babies in Spain and went on to report the matter to police in 2012. In May, she travelled to Madrid with a number of MEPs from the European Parliament who were investigating the claims of child abduction. Labour MEP for the North East, Jude Kirton-Darling, who has campaigned alongside Mrs Appleby, said: "The... decision to hear Ruth's case is a great step forward for both finding the truth about her child, and the countless other mothers who have had their children taken from them. "One of the human rights which is defended in Strasbourg is the right to fair justice, a fair hearing in court. "The second right that Ruth is really challenging on is her right to a family life. Her child has been gone for so long and that's a child that's missing from her family. "It could be a massive precedent which will really blow open this whole scandal and allow people to finally get the justice they have been calling for." Spain's 'NiÃ±os robados' (stolen children)
