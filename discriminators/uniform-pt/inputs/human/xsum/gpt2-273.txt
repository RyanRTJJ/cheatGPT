-resident who said she was given drugs more than 1,200 times at the Kent home. Dr Proctor led inquiries into sex abuse by Savile at Leeds General Infirmary. Her report in 2014 found 60 people said they were abused at the Leeds hospital by the Ex-BBC DJ, between 1962 and 2009. The Kendall House review has been set up by the Bishop of Rochester as a result of concerns raised by former residents. A website is to be set up to allow former residents to contact the panel in confidence and a video has been made about the issues. In 2009, Teresa Cooper told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was given major tranquilisers, anti-depressants and drugs to counteract side-effects while in the children's home. The programme found 10 ex-residents at Kendall House had gone on to have children with birth defects after being forcibly given cocktails of drugs including tranquilisers, during the 1970s and 80s. In 2010, Ms Cooper agreed an out-of-court settlement with the Church of England, which did not accept liability. The Diocese of Rochester said a number of other former Kendall House residents had settled legal claims regarding their personal treatment, but none had started legal proceedings regarding birth defects in their children. The bishop, the Rt Rev James Langstaff, said Dr Proctor would chair a panel of three people who will receive accounts of what happened at Kendall House. He said the panel would also identify lessons learned to inform best practice in the future. Other panel members are retired Det Supt Ray Galloway and part-time judge and barrister Samantha Cohen. "The Kendall House Review panel is an independent panel of exceptional quality and experience," said Bishop Langstaff. "The Church of England is not in a position to act as judge and jury in the absence of any birth defect-related claims being made, and it would be foolhardy to attempt to do so. " I urge all former residents to participate. If former residents feel they have a legal case regarding their treatment, they must bring proceedings accordingly."
