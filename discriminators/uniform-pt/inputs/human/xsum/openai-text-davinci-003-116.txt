Velothon Wales said its team did "their best" to give "clear information" and "never intended to mislead anyone". Mr Davies launched the stinging attack during BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad programme on Wednesday. "The arrogance of this organisation - they're telling lies to people," he said. "They told me that all MPs support it, and that was a lie, they back-tracked when they found out that I was an MP. They told me they consulted with MPs in April, that was a lie because there was no MPs in April." Ahead of the general election in April, all MPs became candidates. On Tuesday, businesses affected by the road closures said they would lose millions of pounds as a result. Residents claimed they will be trapped in their homes on race day. Mr Davies said businesses that lose money should be compensated. "Why should they suffer if somebody else is making a lot of money," he said.
