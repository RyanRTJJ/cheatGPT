The Somali-based group, which much of the world labels a terrorist group, wants to try and create the impression that the attacks are a direct consequence of the presence of Kenyan troops, and Kenyan airstrikes, in Somalia. But the message from Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was uncompromising. At one time during his televised address, in language that reminded me of the language of President George W Bush in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in New York, the Kenyan president told his people they were either with his government, or with the "terrorists".
