 Dons have made a habit of scoring late goals in the competition and Jonny Hayes levelled the aggregate score with two minutes remaining. "I was delighted with everybody but especially the response," said McInnes. "The tie went the way we wanted apart from losing that goal near the end as we were asking questions of a team that defend very deep, just as we planned. "We got in the box, made chance after chance and caused them all sorts of problems. "It could have been a case of 'oh it's just not our night' or been gallant losers again but the goal we got can be so important for us. "The intent was there from the outset while being respectful of what the opposition can do to you because they are a skilful side. "But it says a lot about the team the number of late goals we have had this season. That pleases me no end. "I think that is a mental attitude where they never know they are beat and never know that time is running out. We play on all the way and that got us the very least we deserved out of the game on the night." Aberdeen go into the return tie at the 13,000-capacity Ljudski Vrt Stadium next
