shell Fields in Londonderry in 2008 by her partner Stephen Cahoon. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) will debate the issue at its conference in the city later. Clare's Law was introduced across England and Wales in March 2014. Victims or their friends and relatives can request the information so they know if there are grounds for concern. The initiative is named after Clare Wood, who was murdered by her violent ex-boyfriend several years ago. Emma McBride said her daughter did not know Cahoon had a history of violence against women. He was described by the PSNI as "a dangerous sexual predator with a history of violence towards women". "People would have been aware of who he is and what he was. People could have warned their children, warned their daughters," Mrs McBride said. "I remember asking at the time 'Why was he not on an offenders list?' "If we only had have known what he was like, if he had been on some kind of list, maybe my daughter would still be here today," she said. Emma McBride is convinced the law would have saved her daughters life. "Jean loved her children and they came first, if she had known what he was like, there's no way she would have put them in any danger. "The way I found Jean, I wouldn't like a mother to find what I found," Emma said. "It's a terrible situation and a terrible stress, I miss her a lot." Clare Moore, Equality Officer with the ICTU, described the implementation of Clare's Law in Northern Ireland as an important legislative move. "This issue will be debated at the biennial policy setting conference of ICTU on Wednesday when delegates representing thousands of members will call for women in Northern Ireland to be afforded the same protection as granted to women in other parts of the UK," she said.
