 Championship. "We believe we can win every single game," he said. "If you're going into it with a different mentality than that, you're obviously going to get beaten." Hogg believes Scotland learned from their agonising 23-22 defeat to Australia in the first of the November fixtures, putting those lessons into practice in beating Argentina in similarly dramatic fashion a week later. "You saw at times us going into zigzag patterns and milking penalties against Argentina," he said. "Ultimately that won us the game. We're a fairly young team throughout, so we're continuing to learn and work hard and hopefully we'll continue to improve as well.

I think we're in a very good place. "We've got good depth in our team, everybody's competing for places which makes training a lot better. We're playing some fantastic rugby out there and when we get good set-piece ball, get on the front foot, we look dangerous. "We'll keep grounded, keep working hard, and when the Six Nations comes along we'll fire into it." Scotland begin their Six Nations campaign against Ireland at Murrayfield on 4 February. Captain Greig Laidlaw admits the defeat to the Wallabies still rankles, but says a similarly dynamic and comprehensive preparation is paramount if the Scots are to overcome Joe Schmidt's side. "If I'm being honest, I'm probably still upset about the Australia game," said the scrum-half. "We feel we were good enough to win that and we're disappointed we let it slip away. "But that game's gone, and we'll never get it back, and when we do come back, the training week will be so important. "We trained so much better in the week leading into that Australian game and that shone through in our performance, and if we're going to come close to putting Ireland away, we'll need to train and prepare well for that game."
