Details of the funding were revealed just after new figures for recorded crime showed that the number of sex crimes in Scotland increased by 11% last year, partly linked to a rise in reporting of historic offences. The Scottish government said the cash almost doubled the funding for Scotland's 14 rape crisis centres between 2016 and 2018. The money will also allow Rape Crisis to work with young people on issues of consent and healthy sexual relationships. Mr Matheson announced details of the funding during a visit to the Edinburgh Women's Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre. He said: "We are absolutely committed to tackling domestic abuse and sexual offending in Scotland and this £1.85m funding will help provide important additional support for victims of these terrible crimes. "Organisations such as Rape Crisis Scotland are doing fantastic work across the country, providing a vital service and giving support and advice for victims of sexual violence. "Each of the 14 local rape crisis centres are receiving an 80% rise in financial support and the new services in Orkney and Shetland are very important - making sure women all over Scotland are able to access these vital services." Rape Crisis Scotland national co-ordinator Sandy Brindley said the organisation was "delighted" to receive the "significant additional funding". She added: "This funding will enable every rape crisis centre across the country to employ a dedicated support and advocacy worker who will provide much needed support and assistance. "The funding will also enable us to work in partnership with Women's Aid to establish a rape crisis service across Orkney and Shetland." The money is coming from a £20m pot announced by
