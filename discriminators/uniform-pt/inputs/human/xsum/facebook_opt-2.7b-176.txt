There have been warnings from Ofsted about geographical divides in school achievement, with much attention being focused on weak exam results in coastal schools. But the analysis of provisional results, put out early for the first time this year, shows the north-south gap, based on a line roughly drawn between the Severn estuary and the Wash. According to SchoolDash, this line splits England into 3.7 million pupils in mainstream state schools in the North and about 4 million in the South. And this year, the gap in achieving the benchmark of five good GCSEs, including English and maths, is 4.7% in provisional GCSE results, compared with 4.8% in the final results for 2014. In 2013, the gap was 2.8% and 1.8% the previous year. The results breakdown suggests that London has been consistently the top achiever, with the South West and East Anglia improving. But the analysis also shows that the gap at GCSE level is not consistent with primary school tests or A-levels. The gap in national tests at the end of primary schools has been much narrower - with the most recent results showing a 1.1% difference. The analysis suggests that once deprivation is taken into account, northern primary schools could be seen as more effective than their southern
