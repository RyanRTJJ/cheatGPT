She is known to dislike publicity, and told the TV reporter that flying was difficult for her. "Vladimir Vladimirovich is completely drowned in work," she said. The divorce was "civilised" and the couple would "always remain close", she said. "I am very grateful to Vladimir... that he still supports me.

They have two daughters, Maria and Yekaterina, both in their 20s. "Our children have grown up; they have their own lives,"
