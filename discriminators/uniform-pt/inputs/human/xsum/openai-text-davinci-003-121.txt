 was the second period in a row "with exceptionally high numbers". Scarlet fever commonly affects young children. Parents should look out for signs of a sore throat, headache, fever and pinkish rash on the chest. The rash, which appears within a day or two, can spread to other parts of the body. Although scarlet fever is now a much less serious infection than it used to be, complications can still arise, particularly in those who are not treated promptly. At present, there is no vaccine for scarlet fever. Public Health England said this is the time of year when the highest number of scarlet fever cases are normally seen and they are likely to tail off after a few weeks. But it said it was unclear why substantial increases in cases had occurred in the past two years. Dr Theresa Lamagni, head of streptococcal infection surveillance at Public Health England, said parents should keep an eye out for signs of scarlet fever.
