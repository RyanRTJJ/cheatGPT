results of the independent review have been called "a compelling, exciting and ambitious vision" by the education minister. Prof Donaldson - a former chief inspector of schools appointed last March to look at what is taught in Wales - suggests: Analysis: Curriculum change in Wales 'Positive, profound and patient' proposals Read a copy of the full report The Successful Futures report has taken nearly a year to compile and Prof Donaldson said he had received a "clear and consistent" message after taking evidence from more than 700 people, from pupils and parents to teachers and business. The former schools inspector was commissioned by Education Minister Huw Lewis to undertake a comprehensive and wide-ranging review of the national curriculum and testing. Mr Lewis said: "The scope and scale of the changes he envisages are both fundamental and wide ranging and will take time to create and secure". Prof Donaldson said the proposed changes were about better learning and higher standards. "Better learning because it draws on evidence from Wales and beyond to focus on what really matters in a modern school curriculum," he said. "Higher standards because it sets high expectations for learning and provides ways in which schools and teachers can help young people to meet, and often exceed, those expectations." Chris Keates, general secretary of the NAS/UWT union said the report would be considered carefully. "We broadly welcome the thrust of the review which has the potential to make a positive difference for learners, teachers and the wider workforce in Wales. "The emphasis on ensuring that teachers are given sufficient autonomy in the classroom to make decisions about teaching and learning is particularly welcome." David Evans of the NUT praised how the review had been conducted, adding: "It is absolutely critical now that what Prof Donaldson has set in motion is implemented fully in conjunction with the profession". The Welsh government said it would launch a "great debate'" on the curriculum shortly.
