and politician in southern Africa, represents white supremacy. The university said it had already invited the group to help it achieve an "ever-more inclusive community". The group issued seven demands, including a call for Oxford to "acknowledge and confront its role in the ongoing physical and ideological violence of empire". A university spokesman said the institution was "engaged in constructive and productive dialogue with students on a range of equality and diversity issues". He said: "Last Friday, we re-extended our invitation to Rhodes Must Fall to join other students in this effort to achieve an ever-more inclusive university community. In particular, we wish to discuss the need to address the under-representation of black and minority ethnic (BME) students... We hope they will accept this opportunity." Campaign organiser Sarah Atayero said: "We continue to believe that the removal and relocation of the monument to Cecil Rhodes is critical for Oxford to reckon with its past, and for Oxford to acknowledge the present-day issues it faces around racism and representation." Oriel College denied claims that donors threatened to withdraw more than Â£100m of funding if the statue was removed. Rhodes was a student at Oxford and a member of Oriel College in the 1870s and went on to become prime minister of the Cape Colony in the 1890s. He also gave his name to the historical region known as Rhodesia, which is now Zambia and Zimbabwe. When Rhodes died in 1902, he left money to Oriel College. A scholarship programme in his name has so far been awarded to more than 8,000 overseas students. The "Rhodes Must Fall" campaign began in South Africa, where a Rhodes statue was removed, and the movement was adopted by campaigners in Oxford. On Thursday, the college said the statue should remain but it would add "a clear historical context to explain why it is there". It said: "The college believes the recent debate has underlined that the continuing presence of these historical artefacts is an important reminder of the complexity of history and of the legacies of colonialism still felt today."
