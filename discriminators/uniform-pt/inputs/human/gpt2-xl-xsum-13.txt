monitor is conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) and Grant Thornton UK. It found year-on-year profit growth has fallen from 6% in the second quarter of 2014, to 3.3% in the latest figures. There has been a similar trend in sales volumes and turnover, with export growth being especially hard hit. ICAEW Scotland President Andrew Hewett said: "It is disappointing to once again see a drop in confidence amongst Scottish businesses, particularly when it takes us into negative territory. "This is part of an ongoing decline in confidence in Scotland, which can perhaps be attributed to ongoing uncertainty. "The aftermath of the referendum, the run up to the general election, the forthcoming Holyrood elections and the possibility of an EU referendum combine to mean that there is, potentially, an even deeper degree of uncertainty in Scotland than there is elsewhere in the UK, a feeling which is reflected in Scottish confidence levels." The research found companies were scaling back on recruitment plans. The number of employees was reported to have increased by 0.7% over the past 12 months. The UK figure for the same period was 2.2%. Companies in Scotland expected their workforce headcount to increase by just 0.3% over the next year. The monitor pointed out that, with Scotland's greater dependence on the public sector, UK government plans to cut spending will combine with a slowing of private sector job creation to "impact dramatically" on the Scottish labour market. Grant Thornton UK managing partner in Scotland Kevin Engel said: "This significant drop in confidence north of the border is naturally concerning, particularly given Scotland is the only part of the UK showing such a marked negative trend. "The quarter examined covers the pre-election period, which could go some way to explain the downward shift in confidence. "However the Scottish business community is historically resilient. Now is the time for that tenacity in the face of challenging conditions to come to the fore to resist the potential dip in economic performance that may follow."
