 Hello, I will never forget you or what you have done. You took my trust and shattered it into millions of pieces, like taking a hammer to a piece of glass. I thought we were friends, but friends don't do what you've done. I thought that I could trust you, but I was wrong. I read all of the guides about how to avoid people like you. You know the ones. They warn women to stay with their friends. The guides advise to never leave a drink unattended at a bar and to watch when drinks are poured. Don't become unaware of your surroundings. Constant vigilance is needed. Take RAD classes. Aim for the junk. That was worthless when it came to you. The guides never told me how to avoid you. They never told me how to recognize when a friend was actually anything but friendly. The guides never said that you would respect my bodily autonomy until that one day when you wouldn't. They never said that such a poisonous intention would be wrapped beautifully like the universe's worst gag gift. The worst part of all of this isn't the lost friends, the harassment by the police or even the fact that you got off, literally and figuratively. The worst part is that I will never forget you. I will never forget the taste of you or the way that you smelled. I'll never forget the taste of the fruit punch that you gave me or the way that I couldn't taste the drug you fed me. The worst part is that I will never forget that I can't remember. I will never forget you or what you have done to me.... and I hate you for it. I want you to know that you have not broken me. I am just another victim to you, but what you don't know is that I am a survivor. You will not keep me from
