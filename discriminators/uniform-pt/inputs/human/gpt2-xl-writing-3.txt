 "DEATH!" The crowd's roars fill my ears. It might have been exhilarating if the stakes weren't so damn high. Even with my ace in the hole hidden on my person, the gladiator in the ring with me is terrifying. I'm not even supposed to be the real challenger for him. I'm just the one he warms up the crowd with. Nothing like a good bisecting to make the masses go wild. He turns to the crowd and raises his arms triumphantly before drawing his sword and charging straight at me. It takes one shot and he's on the ground bleeding just like the two lions that had been in the arena before us. I can hear the crowd gasp and some of them stand up from their seats, unsure of what to make of this new weapon. I fire two more shots into the crowd and, predictably, two patricians come tumbling off of the stands. I then shift my aim to the head honcho himself - the emperor. I'll give him credit - he doesn't flinch. I stride up the stands until I'm nine feet away from him. His guards have javelins and arrows pointed straight at me but they wait - unsure of what might happen if I get too close. The crowd has long since started fleeing. "Impressive sorcery.... what do you ask of me?" the emperor asks of me. I smile before gunning down his guards right in front of him in the span of three seconds. His stoic face falls and he looks at the destruction I have caused with nothing but a Glock. "Give me three legions and enough warships to carry them all and I'll be out of your hair forever." I tell him, grinning at just how confident in my victory I'm feeling. He nods reluctantly and my grin widens. I wonder just how history will change once Rome's best legions lands in America and begins to conquer under my command...
