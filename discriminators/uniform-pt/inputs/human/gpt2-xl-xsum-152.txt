Victory this week would see McIlroy become just the sixth player to complete a grand slam of majors, adding to his US PGA Championship titles from 2012 and 2014, his 2014 Open Championship win and the US Open success he recorded in 2011. Last year he chose to sit out the traditional Par 3 contest - played on the eve of the Masters - to focus on winning the main event, but finished tied for 10th, his third top-10 finish in a row.

He will play in this year's Par 3 competition, adding to the number of holes he has amassed on the course in the run-up to the season's first major.
