 14% to £3.38bn. However, total viewing across its channels fell by 3% last year, with the share for the main ITV channel falling from 15.6% to just 15%. The broadcaster, which shows dramas such as Downton Abbey and Coronation Street, said ratings came under pressure in 2015 from the launch of new digital channels, a strong year for the BBC and a poor performance from some programmes. Chief executive Adam Crozier said ITV had an additional 50 hours of drama in the schedules for 2016 as well as major sporting fixtures including the Euro 2016 tournament.

That gives more content to use at home and to sell abroad," he said. "Earnings are enhanced by the deals, and ITV becomes less dependent on terrestrial advertising revenues, which are still an important source of income for the group." ITV Studios has become a global production business with total revenue up 33% to £1.2bn and with 53% of revenues now coming from outside the UK. Last year's acquisition of Talpa brought John de Mol onto the ITV team. He founded Endemol, which went on to develop the Big Brother reality franchise.
