 Jack lived in an ordinary suburban town. He was a cashier in a local grocery store and wasn't rich therefore. One day he finally got enough money to buy a computer. He wanted to do it for a long time, because he used computers of his friends and knew that it allows to do many things. When a computer had finally appeared on his desk, he decided to try playing some games. He knew that there are 5 standard games always installed in modern computers, and he already played all of them. But he found another game named "The Sims 5". He started it, created 2 characters, and then spent a few hours managing their lives. There were some strange things about the game. The game was much more elaborate than others and the characters could do quite a few actions. Also, some of other characters, their neighbours and postman, looked familiar to Jack. Next day, finally returning from work, Jack called his friend, Alex, to visit him. He thought that Alex would be interested in the game. Alex moved into nearby house a year ago. He was an IT guy, successful enough, but sometimes he behaved strangely. He could sit not doing anything for a long time or repeat the same phrases several times. Alex accepted the invite and came in an hour. Jack sit to start the game, Alex stood nearby. After launching, there was a map of the town, and Jack noticed that the town resembles his own and even houses are similar. He found his own house and sent one of his characters there to look around. He saw the character approaching to his house, there was a ring in his doorbell and then.... Nothing.... It seems the universe had stopped to exist. "Fatal error" it reads on a screen. In front of the screen sits a smiling guy looking suspiciously similar to Alex.... -- -- -- -- -- - P.S.: my first try
