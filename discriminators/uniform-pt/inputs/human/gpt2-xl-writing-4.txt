 Day 1 I have spent the last ten years helping my village to survive, and to prosper. I have taught the children every thing I know so they can survive and bring us into the future, or what little future is left for this world. I have protected them, done things no man should have to do, but I did it to protect the village. Can't they see that? Traditional ways do not last in this world. We need to stay caught up with the times. That is why I and to kill the elders! They were a threat to our very existence, being caught up in the ways of the past. The past is dead! And now I am being sent to the one place on the planet that nobody would ever want to go - the deepest, seediest depths of humanity, the urban jungle, Old New York. Day 7,300 something Finally, after twenty years of living in this jungle, today is my last day. I get picked up in a couple of hours. I wonder what the village looks like now. I walked by the Statue of Liberty one last time today. I have always wondered where the head and top part of the torch went. It is a funny thing though, when you think of all the Statue of Liberty meant, now crumbling and forgotten. It used to mean freedom, and now that we have true freedom, the freedom to kill each other because we can, the freedom to rob and rape, the freedom to commit all manner of crimes, we realize how too much freedom can be bad for a nation. Sure, we complained, and we bitched, but deep down, we knew we had it good. But now it has all gone to shit. Well, it will be time to go back to the village soon. I better pack up my belongings. I wonder if I will still have family left to greet me when I get back. Who ever reads this, please
