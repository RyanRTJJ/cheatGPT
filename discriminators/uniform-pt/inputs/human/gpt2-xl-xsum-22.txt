in privately-owned care homes. Their employers are to receive a 2% increase in the rate paid by the health trusts. The decision whether or not to pass that increase onto staff is at the employers' discretion. The Department of Health hopes that the money will be used to boost wages. Stephen Mooney, a healthcare assistant who works at Aughnacloy House care home in Lurgan, County Armagh, said problems recruiting staff were simply "down to wages". He receives about £6.80 an hour and said he felt that rate did not reflect care workers' work and dedication. "It's the type of job that unless you are committed, there's no point in being in it," he said. "If there was a better hourly rate I think it would make more people come forward and there would be better opportunities for people like me." Mr Mooney said a pay increase "would be a nice bonus" for care workers. "We're all dedicated, we work hard and that would enhance it for us." Health Minister Simon Hamilton said the care sector was "a crucial partner" in delivering vital services to vulnerable people. "I am acutely aware of the different challenges they face including recruitment," he said. "This support package should bring some stability and confidence to the sector and reassure residents and their families that we are doing all we can to ensure their continued well-being." Pauline Shepherd, the chief executive of Independent Health and Care Providers, welcomed the extra cash. "Domiciliary care is nearly in crisis and a number of care homes have had to close," she said. "I believe and I hope that it is an acknowledgement that something needs to be done urgently pending a more in-depth and fundamental consideration of what the problems are." The BBC understands the sector will receive an additional rise on 1 April to reflect the change due in the new compulsory National Living Wage of £7.20 an hour, announced by the government last year.
