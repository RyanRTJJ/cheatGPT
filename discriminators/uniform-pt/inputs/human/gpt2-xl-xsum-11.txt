the estate - where houses cost millions - have threatened to block roads during the PGA contest but the club said they were "not the type". PGA organisers said any impact on May's event would be "extremely unfortunate". The Beijing-based Reignwood Group, which bought Wentworth golf club in 2014, unveiled a new membership structure last year.

He said many residents were not multi-millionaires and could not afford the new fees, which are due to come in to force in 2017. "We can, in practice, make it very difficult to hold an event like the PGA," he said. "There are obviously a lot of people who are prepared to block the road if required," he added. A spokeswoman for the club said it was disappointing to hear of the threat to block roads, but if there was a "serious threat of this nature" the estate would make the club aware. She said Wentworth residents had respected the PGA championship for 44 years and there had never been any disruption before.
