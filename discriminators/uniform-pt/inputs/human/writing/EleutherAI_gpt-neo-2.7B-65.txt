 Frank finished his margarita and set the empty glass back in the cupholder of his chair. The waves rolled over his bare feet in the sand as the sun slowly set over the pristine ocean. Not a soul was in sight, except for the gorgeous woman he held in his arm whose blonde hair caressed his face as it blew in the wind. It was the most beautiful place he's ever imagined, and he was very proud of that fact. Ever since he bought his new DreamScape Lucidity Device he had been striving to create the perfect paradise, something he could share with his future soulmate, whenever he happened to meet her. The DreamShare module was going to hit the market next month, and he knew it was his chance to share something beautiful and untouched by the devestation and pollution which had befallen the real world. Designing this place had proven more difficult than Frank had originally thought, as he had to start anew after the world disintegrated into nothingness each time he awoke. Now after so much practice sculpting the landscape and breathing life into the world around him, he could create his personal heaven at will. The woman next to him was but a figment of his imagination, but he was practicing for the day he would find his true love. The woman was real here and now, and they had spent hours talking, making love and enjoying the halcyon beach before them. Frank's watch beeped a shrill tone, and as he stood up the woman's blissful face changed to an expression of dread. As much as he enjoyed his time in paradise, he'd been late to work too many times already. He pushed the button on his watch. "Please don't go..." were the woman's last words as she and the beach ceased to exist. Frank awoke and looked to the empty half of the bed next to him. One day, he thought, he would not be alone.
