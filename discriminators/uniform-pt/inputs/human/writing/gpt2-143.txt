 I sat there, staring at the clock, waiting for the clock the hit 18:56- the exact time of my birth. On my lap sat a phone, my phone to be exact, open to a text conversation with my crush, asking her about the process of getting her powers (Pyrokinesis), which she assured me was completely painless. She did, of course, have to wait a few weeks for her eyebrows to grow back in, but that was beside the point. I looked at the clock, 18:55. Then, after what seemed an eternity (really only 5 seconds), the clock struck 18:56. I looked around the room and at myself. I certainly didn't feel any different, I didn't look different, and after a few hundred attempts, I was forced to admit that I couldn't control a thing or anyone. As a last ditch attempt, I shot Suzanne a quick photo with the caption'Any different'? She quickly replied back,'Not that I can see. What'd you get?' 'IDK' I responded, crawling into bed, crying softly into my pillows. The next day, I was woken by a loud rapping noise on my window, and the bkices of a thousand men. I slowly trudged out of my bed, into the front room, where I saw that it wasn't in fact thousands, but thousands of thousands, each wearing the most fabulous clothes I had ever seen. As I opened the front door, they all turned, simultaneously, and man at the front looked at me and said, "H-Hello, Mr. Waterson, right? Umm, well, not to say I work with the NSA, well actually I do, but well, umm I just happened to see your picture, and well, I just want to tell you that you look absolutely gorgeous, and that, umm, well, will you go out with me?"
