I hit the guardrail and begin to flip, time slowing down to a crawl. I am concious of someone screaming, probably me, and then I hear a sickening crunch as the car lands upside down. My neck snaps on impact, as I was securely belted in. I yawn, then stop mid yawn. What the.... I was just dead, of that I'm sure, and now here, waking up in some strangers bed.

I hear the baby crying. Well, dead or not,
