 Life on Earth had changed drastically since the first Flood, which eliminated countless cities built below sea level. Global warming and climate change supporters claimed they were right all along, that our selfishness and denial had doomed us to this fate, as parts of frozen continents like Greenland and Antarctica simply melted away. Three months later the world experienced the harshest winter ever recorded in history, and the world refroze. World leaders came together and vowed to make an immediate change to renewable energy to prevent anything like that from happening again. It seemed to work, for a while. Until Antarctic scientists began reporting massive polar cap losses again. The next Flood was more brutal than the last, as was the next winter. Every year more and more land began to shrivel and shrink away from us until finally it became clear that the next Flood would leave no land left at all. The U.N. began holding emergency meetings. Frantic and frightened, the world leaders struggled to come to an agreement on what to do next. Some leaders, such as the U.S. and the U.K., suggested building a cornucopia of boats to try to preserve the population. Russia began erecting massive buildings to stay above the flood, while China began constructing gargantuan walls to keep the waters at bay.

Liquor stores started selling out like crazy, another thing people turned to in order to cope. News stations capitalized on the imminence of death and the failure of those in charge to make a decision in time. And then word came from SCAR, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. The polar caps were melting slower
