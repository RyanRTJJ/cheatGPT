 I stood in the market peeling the potatoes to put into my soup, 25 coppers for a single bowl, not bad right? Especially considering how it heals you for 500 health. I looked over at the clothing stand and saw something peculiar happen. A strangely outfitted man named XxDankKushxX walked around carrying only a sword. An adventurer? No. He couldn't be, he was not wearing any armor, not even a scrap of cloth on his back save for a loin cloth. He walked over to my stand and dug around in his small bag and pulled out 3 gold coins. "25 bowls please." I waited a few moments. "Tw-.... twenty five?" I asked. "My soup heals for 500, are you sure you want that many bowls? They don't last very long." The strange man stared at me.I followed his vision down to my breasts. Oh for the love of god, I cant go one day without encountering a pervert. He dropped the gold coin on the counter and walked away with his bowls of soup to sit down at the table. I looked at his name tag that hovered over his health and mana bar. What a strange man he is. He pulled out the bowls and started to drain them, one after another. "What a waste," I thought to myself. His health bar was only missing a few inches.... that were only going up by a few centimeters each bowl. No no no, that cant be happening. The average adventurer's health is only supposed to be at around 900 in this level 95 area. I pulled out my glasses of inspection, which only npc's had. I put them on and started scrolling through the statistics. "lets see here," I mumbled quietly. "100 mana? That can't be right. What is this?
