 "Get inside." The henchman grunts. The man is weary from continuous work and determinedly walks up the stairs being guarded by the mobster scanning the perimeter for anyone around. The man walks up the stairs. "It's about fucking time." He says. He looks at the "welcome" mat and it makes him even more willing to do what he has to do. Looks down at the henchman. The henchman aims down the sight "Don't do anything stupid now." He said lining up the sights with his head. The man chuckles and lights up a cigarette he has tucked away on top of his right hear. The henchman still has the sights on him as takes a few a few puffs while setting the weapon down calmy before him. "Easy now, Easy," the man says mid puff, "no need to get weird here my man. I know how many guys are in there. My last smoke." setting the weapon down gave the false sense of security to the guard just a split second away from the sights to say, "Yeah, why so man-" were the last words he could get out before the man kicked the gun in the air and punched him in the throat. Not being able to scream, the man is able to grab the gun and in a golf swing fashion at his genitals. A swift gun whip to the temple knocks him unconscious. The man collects the weapon and hides the body. Looking at his cigarette, he has a pull left. "Looks like this is it." He says, and taking the last hit and chucking it. Picks up the two guns and kicks down the door. "And **scene**!" The henchman runs up to the man angrily. "Hey man, I know acting and all but why did you have to actually hit me?" He said holding his crotch in pain. The man replied, "I'm **Steve Martin**, I do what I want." and blew the last puff of smoke in his face.
