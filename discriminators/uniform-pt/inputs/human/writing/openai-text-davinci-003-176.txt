 I thought to myself this had to be some kind of joke, like any minute now some camera crew with a slick host is going to pop out from hidden spots and told me I've been punk'd. When I stared at the glowing golden ticket in my hand though I realized, this was no game or trick it was very real and I was now expected to rise up and lead our country to a more prosperous future. It has been close to 24 years since the revolution of the common man was won, and the very first act put into place upon that victory became known as the Common Man Bill. This bill was passed as a way to stop all the conspiring between politicians and big businesses. The first ticket lotto resulted in a mechanic from Illinois named Bob ascending to the position of president of the United States. Bob and those who would follow after him seemed to have rocky starts but always managed to leave the country in a good state, not great mind you but considering they were just an everyman moments before each lotto occurred they did amazingly well. This year I finally became of age to enter the lotto myself and did it merely on a whim, thinking it was probably rigged anyway no way someone like myself was going to win. Win it I did though, and now I have to head over to the state capital where I will be briefed upon all that will become my responsibility before heading off to D.C... I take another look at the golden ticket in my hand, sigh to myself, and made the call that will change my life forever.
