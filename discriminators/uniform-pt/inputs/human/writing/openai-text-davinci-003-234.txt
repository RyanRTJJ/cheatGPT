 "Ho ho ho! What's your name my boy?" "I'm Jimmy Carlson!" "And what do you want for Christmas this year, Jimmy?" "I want my puppy, Santa!" *MY puppy? What kind of kid takes ownership before even being told they'll get the thing? * "Don't you mean *a* puppy?" "No Santa, I want *my* puppy, Cochise!" "Where is this puppy named Cochise, that makes you need to ask Santa Claus for him?" "He's in the backyard, Santa.... I want him back in the house." "Why is he in the backyard, Jimmy? Is he in trouble? Did your puppy eat your homework?" "No, Santa.... He's **IN** the backyard. I want him **OUT**." *I drop my smile for a split second and glance longwise at the nearest elf. * "Wh-what do you mean he's in the backyard?" "I put him there." "You want him back even though you put him out there?" "I wanted to put another one there, but none of my neighbors have dogs, so I need Cochise back. And I didn't put him out there, I put him in there." *I signal the elf to come take over. God, I hope he's heard enough to know what he's walking into. * "Well, Jimmy, Santa Claus has to go consult The North Pole's library about bring back little pups named Cochise. You just wait right there and Santa will be right back, okay?" *I really need to learn how to mask my emotions better. Panic is all over
