 It took exactly 29 minutes for me to get bored of the party back in Stacy's house. Brad's drunk shenanigans got annoying after 5. Stacy got tired from blowing every single person at the party at 17. Don't forget about Margot, who beat Raj as the beer pong champion at 26. Her parents must be so proud. I walked out of the party, and almost instantly walk into a strange smell. I ignore it, not even trying to guess what it is, and seat myself beside an old oak tree across the street on the park. I take a sigh of relief. I have full view of Stacy's house, and the shenanigans that it currently hosts. But here, its peaceful, and quiet. Alone in the dark. I smile, and close my eyes. The smell returns. I open my eyes. As I sniff the air around me, I hear a faint noise, almost like, a giggle. My body goes stiff, and I slowly crane my head above me.... Where my gaze meets two red eyes, staring back. My heart almost stops, and a gasp gets caught halfway out of my mouth. The thing giggles, and smoke begins wisping through the branches above. I can't stand it anymore. I take out my phone, and shine its light into the now hazy branches above me. I must see what this creature is, even though every part of me wants to run. My light finds.... Aaron Bromley, giggling and puffing on a joint as his red eyes continue to gaze at me. "God fucking damnit, Aaron."
