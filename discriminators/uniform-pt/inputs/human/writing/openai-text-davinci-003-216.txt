How they never want to see it again, and how the dolls talk to them at night, and blah blah blah. Just kids being kids, right? Love a toy one day, bored of it the next. Parents were also complaining that their child would start talking like “ some kind of creepy British girl. ” Saying “ mummy dearest ” instead of “ mom ”, and babbling on about “ completing the blood-ritual on the next full moon
