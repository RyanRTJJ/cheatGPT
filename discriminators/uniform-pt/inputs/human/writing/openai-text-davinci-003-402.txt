 He was a scrawny thing, with pale skin that hinted at a life devoid of sunlight. A thick wool scarf was wrapped tightly around his neck, and he kept his chin tucked into the mound of fabric to keep warm. An abnormally large cranium teetered atop his osteoporotic spine like a dreidel that was about to come to terms with gravity. I almost felt for the poor bastard, but there was no time for pity - the registrar had been breathing down my neck for three weeks, and if I couldn't come up with the cash by sunrise it was game over. I looked him over with cold, clinical eyes. Using my extensive knowledge of the human body, I quickly found my target. The same target I always used. As he stepped forward to shake my hand before the match, I made my move. There was no place for congeniality in a street fight, and brainiac was about to find this out the hard way. With cat-like speed I lunged forward, planted my left foot, shifted my weight and then drove the dorsal surface of my right foot straight up into his groin with astonishing force. But something was wrong - I felt a sickening crunch and fell to the floor, clutching my shattered foot in shock. That punt would have ruptured the testicles of an elephant! How was this possible? As I looked up at my opponent, I noticed something that defied all logic. Something that shook me to my core. The scarf had fallen loosely towards his chest, and beneath the tufts of unshaven facial hair I noticed a wrinkled and elongated sack of flesh dangling from his chin like an overripe pear. The crowd gasped in horror. I heard a voice cry out: **He's a ballchinian! **
