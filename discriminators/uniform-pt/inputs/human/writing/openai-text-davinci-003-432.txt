 'Kaiju' That's what the plaque beneath it said. Brass, and glimmering under the high lights that cut through the dim dimensions of the structure build around this staggering monster. I used to visit it as a child- bent glasses and scraped knees and curious hands. There is a sign saying don't touch- but no one was looking. Milling about sure, hell people were milling about now looking at rocks and relics of the day this thing first crawled from the sea. I blink up at it, squinting so as to try and see it's head from the ground floor, impossibility- but I always try. "Kaiju..." I say to myself, rolling the word around my mouth and letting my eyes score down it's scales. Before I freeze- I swear to god that it's tail twitched. Just at the joint, minutely. I wave at a security guard, who puts down his paper and I tell him in hurried tones that I swear I just saw it move. He smiles and says they all say that and is then interrupted by a low creaking. Everyone freezes, and you can feel the tension- primal in the air. Years, this has been still for so long and now.... Now it is moving. "Out. Out!" I shout to the people behind, repeating it a good few times I didn't count until eventually we are talking museum wide panic. Good, good response- because it is beginning to move, and oh god the people upstairs- I stop, security guard batters my shoulder and moves on. I am looking up, I don't so much see it as feel the weight leave the ground as it slowly lifts it's foot. "Kaiju."
