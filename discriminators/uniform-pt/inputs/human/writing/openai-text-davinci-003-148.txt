 Pushing aside a pile of discarded papers, Roy lay on his bed waiting for inspiration to hit him. Looking at the thousands of pages surrounding him he contemplated the value of his work. "20 years," he whispers. Starting in his youth, Roy set out to write a novel that would truly sum up everything he felt about life. The ennui of the everyday, the joy of creation. The problem though is his life kept changing and his views on the world with it. Rifling through a stock of papers he finds a pile from around Chapter 52. He reads aloud. 'He never truly gained any insight from the loss of his love other than he could feel pain and plenty of it...' "Ah," he thought. "This was after the divorce." He thought back on that time in his life and relived the feelings. He still doesn't understand why his wife never supported his work or why she felt him committing to writing full time was a mistake. She will see though. The importance of this work was too great to not be seen. Inspiration was lacking tonight. The protagonist in his story had reached a crossroads he couldn't resolve.
