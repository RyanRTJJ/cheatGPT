 I stuck the last pin into my hand. One of dozens. One for even the smallest chockra. I breathed in the cool night air. I savored the feeling. I would need to do my organs next. Breathing would soon become uncomfortable. My gaze drifted from the pile of long metal pins still unused by my side to the city on the hill below me. From up here, it looked so insignificant. Some times I thought it was insignificant. I had done something I wasn't supposed to do. I had fallen in love. I had experienced what it was to live. All of it.

I needed to wait many lifetimes to fulfill that purpose. But it had been too long. The world seemed hollow and unreal, so different from the animal skin tent I had grown up in. And now, I had to carry a pain with me that I was not sure would ever heal. For how long? Another few thousand years? I sighed. I had been chosen for a reason. I was stuborn. I was resolved to my task. I picked up another pin and shoved it into my kidney. I looked at the young man tied down and gagged next to me. I put a pin into his kidneys in the same place I had just put for mine. I felt the energy flow from my body to his. I watched him wince. This task had never been pleasent. But then again, what ever was?
