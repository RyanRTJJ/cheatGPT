 Before last night, everything was ok. I was going to a party with my friends. All I remember before blacking out is taking a shot and talking to a girl. This morning, I woke up with so many tally marks it was unbelievable. I looked black, that's how many tally marks I had. What did I do? Weirdly enough, I woke up in my bed at home. I was cleaning up in the bathroom mirror when I saw what was covering my body. I looked different. I looked.... more experienced. Weird. I walk into my living room to see a handgun on the kitchen counter. Everything feels so weird. My place looks different. Is that a new TV? When I pick up the gun, almost instinctually I load it and cock it. I've never even seen a gun in real life before. I take out my phone to call my buddy Jeff to see what happened. This is all too weird. What the fuck is this? This isn't my phone, what is this? Touchscreen? Was I so drunk I went and bought a futuristic phone? An icon pops up: 10 O CLOCK APPOINTMENT: SENATOR JOB. Senator job? I'm confused. My neck immediately starts hurting immensely. I look down at the phone again and look at the blinding letters: JUNE 12, 2016 2016? No. It can't be. It's 2007. I hear a creaking sound and turn around. Standing in front of me is a woman who looks so familiar. She points her gun at my chest and shoots. As I lay on the ground, numb, I hear her talking. "There was a malfunction in his chip, bring in the next one."
