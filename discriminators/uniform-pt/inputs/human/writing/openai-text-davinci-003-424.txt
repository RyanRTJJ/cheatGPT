 This must be some sick game, he thought after huffing his mix of bleach and ammonia for a while. He had read it was supposed to produce lethal fumes, but for some reason it just smelled sweet. Sugary. He decided to take a sip. Yep, it was soda. He sighed. "Is there no way to end this sickening life", he thought to himself. He was starting to run out of ideas. He sat back down on his computer and opened a new tab and started typing, once again: *Easy ways to end your life*. "That is pretty childish, even by your standards, Mischief", said Bubonic Plague. Startled, Mischief turned around. "Look, stepping on a rake and hitting oneself on the head with the shaft got old as soon as they invented leafblowers. I got to pass the time somehow, you know", he replied with a smirk on his face. Bubonic Plague sighed and shook her head. "You know how boring it gets for me in these modern days, with all their science and medicines? Cut the man some slack and let him end his days if he so wishes." "Yeah yeah", Mischief replied with a wave of his hand. "Look, I've been keeping count. His next attempt will be the 51st. I'll let him go soon enough. It's starting to bore me -- wait, wait! You got ta see this one!" The man pulled the trigger of the revolver placed against his temple. He sighed. Yet another "Bang!" -flag came out of the barrel. Bubonic Plague rolled her eyes and started to walk away. "Whatever floats your boat, Mischief."
