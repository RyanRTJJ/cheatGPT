 This had always been, and hopefully always will be a safe haven. My permanent residence, now. At least, when not on a voyage. Am I a pirate? Perhaps. Though I hardly call taking back what is rightfully mine stealing. It's almost like a children's tale. A deposed prince is sent in exile on pain of death. Except this tale doesn't have a happy ending. At least, not yet. The Consul would argue that I'm a thief, a crook and a murderer. But then that lying king-killing son of a bitch would, wouldn't he? An Imperial galleon every time my money runs out doesn't seem too bad though, does it? You might call tying up the captain, whipping him raw and dangling him upside down from the mast might be cruel, since I'm only after their provisions and any interesting loot they happen to have. But considering what they'd do if they caught me, I think it's fair enough. There are other, more populous ports, sure. I go to them when I need to sell any loot, or when I start lusting for things a crew of seventeen men and three women can't provide. Or at least aren't willing to provide. But if you're a 21 year old with his money burning a hole in his pocket in one of the most debauched places on earth, well, that changes things. You either become a lot more attractive to the ladies if the town or you go searching for the ladies of the night. But there's something peaceful about the solitude and camaraderie the Hidden Harbour provides. Something I wouldn't trade for all the money and all the tavern wenches in the world. Well. Maybe
