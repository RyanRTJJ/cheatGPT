 I've been sitting at these doors for a while now. Thousands if not millions of people have passed me and chosen n a door. Everyone who passes me is always so sure of there decision. Many pick the door of happiness. It sounds nice, to always be happy, no worries, every thing you could possibly want. Some pick the intelligence door. Most of them exclaim "Could you imagine! Infinite knowledge! There would be nothing one couldn't do! Nothing one couldn't do with all that power!" as they pass me by. All look down on me. They all immediately know the right answer and scorn me for not being able to make a decision. This third door though.... I'm curious. What could the third door contain. Many have said that it obviously contains hell since one of the other two contains their idea of heaven. It's too obvious. Why would God not simply tell us that hell is in it then since it is so obvious. After a millennium of thinking, of saying now countless souls pass by and! make their choice I come to a realization that the doors can not possibly contain what God has said they do. One can not have eternal happiness without infinite knowledge as they would always be left wondering if they made the right choice. One can not have infinite knowledge or else they would know how to return to this place and choose the second door and would also be able to tell people like me what exactly is in the third door. To me, both of these conclusions are a kind of hell. God watches as I finally rise and walk towards the third door. I turn the handle, open the door and walk through. A voice speaks to me. It tells me that I have made a good choice. The voice tells me that this door contains the result of both other doors combined. I am perfectly happy now, knowing that I made the right choice. I have infinite knowledge, including knowing the contents
