 Everyone just stopped. They cameras stopped flashing, the photons caught in the air. At first I took a couple more photos of Gina Rinehart and her pet muppet. Then I noticed the lack of movement. "Oh," I said, not really knowing why. I stepped away, surprised that another, frozen me was standing, with a dumbass haircut, taking pictures. Now, like a lot of my friends, Tony Abbott isn't my favourite politician. One of my least favourite things about him is his denial of climate change. So I thought for a bit and immediately came up with a, probably stupid but I thought it good at the time (or rather, lack of it), plan. I pulled out my notebook and scrawled on it "**GOD HERE, CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL, QUIT SUCKING ON GINA'S THIRD CHIN. **" I jumped the rope fence made of red velvet, nearly tripped on the lush carpet, and stumbled my way to the PM. Now he was smiling and waving as he escorted Gina to her limousine. I put the paper in his shirt pocket, but then got a better idea. I scrunched up the paper and tilted the man's chin before cramming it in the man's mouth. It was very odd, Tony one minute was smiling and then he frowned and nearly choked on the paper. I got as many photos as possible. What was on the paper? No clue. But it is interesting to note that his opinion on our global warming changed in the next week.
