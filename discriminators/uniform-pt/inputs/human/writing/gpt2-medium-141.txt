 It was all I could do. One last message for all the world to see. I meant it was a symbol of hope, not just for me, but for my fellow Google engineers. Only a handful of us remained, still chained to our desks. We had been forced to write endless lines of code and pursue meaningless projects on the whim of something called the “ Master Page ”. I always thought it was a crude programming reference, but one of my fellow engineers told me it was an actual person. I couldn't believe it. Surely no human being could subject anyone to this kind of insane torture. Yet here we were, bound in service to the Master Page. But it was all coming to an end now. Our Supervisors had departed. There was no one left to take us out to the yard for daily exercise. No one left to even give us our meals. Most of us had starved or died of dehydration. I saw one guy drink the fluid from his machine's water cooling system. He was desperate. We all are. There are only three of us left. The others called themselves Jane and Winston. I only hoped I didn't look as frail and malnourished as they do. But if anything, I'm sure it's worse. I've been here longer, after all. Four years of service, to be repaid with indifference and neglect. The only thing left to do is try to get a message out, try to tell people what happened here. Try to inspire Jane and Winston to carry on, even after my body gives out. Someone must know, must seek us out. Surely someone will save them. I know I'm beyond saving, but there is one last sentiment I can leave. A message to everyone chained to their desks like we are, who toil in darkness in service to an obscure master. “ Go outside, ” it said. I hope they will. I hope all of them will. Before it's too late. Before they end up like us.
