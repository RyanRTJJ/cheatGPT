 My kid needs me. He's small, he's got glasses, but he smells good and he's always talking to me, playing with me and taking care of me. We do this game together where we put our heads low to the ground, against each other, and do this weird sort of push off. I mostly let him win, because he grabs me and hugs me a lot when he does. I mostly like to listen to him, to be honest. I'll lay on my side and he puts his head on my side and looks up at the sky, telling me all sorts of things. Sometimes it's good stuff, like some award he's won at school, but most of the time he's talking about his bullies and how frustrated he is with them. I gave up getting angry about it. I know he needs met to listen more than he needs me to bite them, though I tell you I still fantasize a little bit about doing it. We go everywhere together, he and I. There's other kids, but he's mine, and we've got each other's backs. Why am I telling you all this? Because he needs me right now and I can't be there. He's the kid on the street, bawling, trying to get his Dad out of the school over there. Someone threw a stick out in the road and I ran out here and got hit by a car. See how my leg is bent up the wrong way. That's the least of it. I can feel everything busted inside. Do me a favour, OK? You seem like a nice lady, so can you take care of him for a bit? I'd love to lick him one last time, to be honest, but he's too busy trying to find someone to save me.
