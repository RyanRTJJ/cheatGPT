 I stepped into the empty room, with nothing but a granite chair in the center. I heard a voice through an intercom, "Welcome Daniel, thank you for choosing Power Source. We will be guiding you in finding out your power. Let's get started with the chair. Can you try lifting it?" I walked over and placed my hands to both sides. I tried concentrating, but it wouldn't budge. Before I could try another angle, I heard the voice again. "That's fine, you can stop now." I got up from the floor feeling slightly disoriented, and sat down in the chair. I noticed a new object in front of me, some sort of puzzle. I blinked, and it was gone. "Wait, what's going on?" .... I got up from the chair, noticing the clock now hung on the wall in front of me. "Hello?" Something was off. I could have sworn I came in here at 3, but according to the clock it was almost 5:30. "Yes, We're almost done with your evaluation. One more test. Imagine it being 6:00." I closed my eyes and concentrated. I imagined moving ahead 30 minutes. I opened my eyes, and to my shock, the clock said 6:03. "Fascinating," I heard the voice say. "Thank you Daniel, your evaluation is finished. You may now exit the room. An assistant will take you to the observation room where you may review video footage and be given your classification. Thanks again for choosing Power Source!" I opened the door and was taken straight to the observation room. I looked at the paper.... My power is.... Great. My brother gets telekinetic gps and I get to will narcolepsy.
