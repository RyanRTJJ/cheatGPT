 Every person in the world has a number. A number that shows how much cash you make in this world. This number updates every hour, defines social hierarchy, and (the best part) tells who is most likely to get robbed/killed. Over this last year, there has been a 20 % increase in crime all around the world. People know how much you make. For us in the ghetto, we only make an average of 35,000 per year. Anyone here that shows 55,000+ ends up getting shot. I used to be sick about how we are like that and how often it would happen, then I started doing it to support myself and my family. The income that is displayed is money that is given out by the government and corporations we work for. The number is based on how much goes in the bank every day. Depositing your paychecks and other cash is mandatory and you must do it at least once or twice a day (at least for us immigrants). There is hardly any jobs here in Oakland, California. I get, at most, $ 7.50 an hour working in the day, but nighttime is a whole different story. Sometimes, I drive out to major cities or even Beverly Hills to try and see if there is any rich, white people that come home drunk. Right before they think about entering their houses, me and my crew off them and, if their security isn't on, we try and rob their expensive items. How do we get away with it? It's easier than you think. The government can't track the money we steal. I mentioned that the income updates every hour. In the 59 minutes you have after it updates, that's when you hide the money in a safe and not check it through the bank. Safes are almost impossible to find in this country, and if the police catch you with one, you are going to jail. Luckily, my cousin Arturo found one from back home
