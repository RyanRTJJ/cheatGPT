 Mr. Dictionary, that's what they call me anyways. When I was only six is when it started, my mother had us take a trip to Europe and when we were in France, I could understand the people there, all of them. I tried talking to one of them and my mother stood in shock. I, a random Minnesotan had spoken perfect French at age six. I hated it as a kid, all the journalists in my house and the constant questions whenever I would go out. "Speak in Spanish!" They would yell at me. But I got used to it and finished school with straight A's in foriegn languages. I got a job as a computer company's foriegn ambassador after college. it paid well but my passion was traveling, going anywhere and understanding everyone and having them understand me. Then I met him, the odd one out, the outlier, the unaccounted for, the person who I didn't understand. I couldn't take it, it was all just jibberish, nothing made sense, my brain couldn't handle it. We met again and again, we even had English professors come with and broadcasted our "conversations" on the radio. But thank the Lord, my savior was listening to the radio program. My problem person was speaking a constructed language, one he knew how to speak but nobody else. We picked it apart piece until finally, I could understand him, it worked, all was well in the world, I could sleep again, and my dictionary was complete once again. FWI: I suck at grammar, sorry if there are mistakes and sorry for my bad storytelling EDIT: some spelling
