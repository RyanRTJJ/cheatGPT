 (First story here. Input is appreciated.) Five minutes to the bell. It took me a while to set this all up. Had to watch the janitors and the technicians. Had to keep an eye on the security guards' movements and rotations. It wasn't hard. I analyze everything. It didn't take much.... just a lot of time. Four minutes to the bell. Through the door, head down, straight to class. Same as always. Avoid their glances, avoid their stares. Don't speak, just walk. Funny, I kinda like talking. Enjoy it very much. They just never wanted to hear it. Three minutes to the bell. I was sure I would find friends among the nerd crowd. "My own kind," if you will. I was wrong. They were even worse. None of them wanted to think. None of them wanted to discuss every detail or look deeper to the story. No one wanted to hear, "This is bad," or, "This could be better." They only wanted praise. So the analyze was pushed aside. Again. Two minutes to the bell. You know the one thing I learned in high school? There is no happiness. It's an illusion. Nothing is going to get better, and nothing will ever be good. Friends will betray you, people will make incredible mistakes, and no one will pause to think. One minute to the bell. There's my first classroom. The first is there. The pistol in my hoodie's inner pocket suddenly feels a lot heavier. I check my watch again, carefully synchronized to the ringer. The smoke bombs wired into the system won't hurt anyone. They'll just make some chaos. Chaos I can use. One quick, suppressed shot to the back. Keep is concealed, do it as inconspicuously as possible. 30 seconds to go.
