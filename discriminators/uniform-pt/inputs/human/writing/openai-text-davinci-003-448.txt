 "You should have listened to us Jack. If you did you could have been home with your family celebrating your birthday." He leaned against the cell door. Your typical beaurcratic man in black. Trimmed hair cut silver spoon fed his whole life and money to every step in his life. Jack chuckled. "And if I did, half of Miners District would be under 100 ft of rubble." Jack was dressed in prisoners orange garb, shackles on his feet and hands. A tear slid down his eyes. "WE'VE PASSED THE MOON, ENTERING ATMOSPHERE SHORTLY PLEASE FIND THE NEAREST SEATING POD AND GET READY." The man stepped back and sat down across from the cell strapping himself in. Just as the ship began to descend he replied," Welcome home Jack, the birthplace of our species and your personal hell till the day you die." He grinned and Jack grinned right back. They would not see him break. "We're gon na land I think what they used to called the United States. Hell of place you know? Ravaged by nuclear war in late 2100s and then it seemed as if the very earth turned against them. Constant earthquakes, tsunamis hitting the coast and nonstop storms all across the land." He laughed. "Not to mention the without human interference and the late radiation caused all kinds of lovely mutations and if you think that's it, wait till you meet your neighbors." He cackled again. "Man you got all this money but dear God, you need to hire a better dentist." Jack grinned. He made a sour face. "WE'VE BREACHED THE ATMOSPHERE. WELCOME TO THE BLUE PLANET EARTH, MAXIMUM PRISON C-6. LANDING IN 20."
