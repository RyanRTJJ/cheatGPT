 I scanned the area where the target was gon na come out with through the scope of my rifle and swore to myself as I saw them. "Fuck!" I stood up and began pacing the length of the roof and told myself that everything would be fine, even though The Nutcase and the only guy I considered my equal in skill was there. "Ryan or "The Nutcase" as as everyone called him stood across the street and stared intensly at me. He probably thought I couldn't see him. Ha pathetic. I looked up and down the street to try and spot if anyone else was there. I looked up and saw a weird glinting at the edge of a roof and then I saw him pacing about on top of the roof. "Oh.... Mr. "I'm too fancy for this contract" is here" I shot him a text detailing my feelings. "Fuck you Alex. This contract is mine! He sent me one back almost instantly. "We'll split the money so that you get 70 % after fees if you take out The Nutcase?" "My C.R.D is tuned for someone with the health and heartfailures of the target. So sry wont be able to Kill Ryan with it." They were arguing over text when I spotted them. This was almost too easy. The target walked out the door and I ignored him completely. Alex tried to shoot the target but his gun exploded and killed him instantly. Just as I passed jones he noticed that small pieces of his texting partner were raining down on the streets. A shot echoed and Jones' brain matter formed a Jackson Pollock painting on the orange brick wall behind him. "So Ryan, that was how you carried out two contracts at the same time?" The Boss asked flatly. "Yes, I just uploaded a contract on some random fellow waited until those two accepted and formed a plan. Now. I want my 20 millions.
