  > "We need help! The Rogan race is attacking us! We'd do anything for FTL, even consort with the Humans!" Well, far be it from us, to decline such a request, hello, alien, do you bleed? We'll gladly provide you with everything you want (but is it what you need?). Faster than light, wormhole travel, we'll even throw an acubierre drive, you've got nothing to lose. But we have a price, it's admittedly expensive, for your people.... SET US LOOSE! -- - We were trapped, in this place, a long time ago, before the birthing of your race.... Now we're the boogymen, the nightmare that you fear, the danger nobody wants to face.... We're the terror of the universe, and for what, because we genocided a few worlds. Our price is very simple, let us loose, and you'll get everything you dreamed. We'll give you lasers, we'll give you nukes, we'll give you AM weaponry that really fucking rocks. We'll give you chemicals, we'll give you science,
