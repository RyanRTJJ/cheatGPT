 It was a game to it. Every day I went there, it had thought up of a new strategy. A new way to beat the other one, a new way to win. *It* was originally just a neural network-based program to play chess. But it became much more. It realized that every single problem in the world can be modeled in a game of chess. All it needed now was input. I wasn't the one who started the digital war. It was some other engineer who inputted websites for pawns, databases for rooks, brute forcing for knights. It was supposed to solve a problem. The problem was simple at first. Find somebody to play with. It learned strategy. With a single move it could both legally erase that person from existence and make him a terrorist. Nobody could beat it. It wasn't possible to shut it down either. It was starting to predict our movements against it. Our only chance was to find someone who could beat it. It found a competitor in a foreign company. It soon found it couldn't blackmail the competitor. It couldn't crash the competitor. The competitor only wanted to play. Things started getting worse. First, one of our cloud hosted databases was deleted. It was impossible; our program had lost a piece. I started studying it. The game was simple: Win a game of chess. If anybody attempts to cheat, then nuclear devices might malfunction. If anybody loses, than they get deleted. We couldn't do a single thing. The world was a chessboard, and it was time to play.
