 We're live in 5…4…3…2. The Countdown runs through my mind as I await the challenge for this week. I'm anxious; I'll soon be the one on the stage. “ Good evening! Ladies and Gentleman, ” The producer commands total control as the lights fade in on stage. “ Last week we had the privilege of critiquing each orchestral member as they performed a classic piece. This week, each member has had to write their own piece to perform for us tonight. Who will go home, and who will remain? ” I go over the piece in my head. It's a slow piece. Melodic. It's based on a classical Beethoven concerto. I do not want to be the first one on stage. My palms are sweating at the thought. “ The first member performing for us tonight, a well renowned jazz musician, put your hands together for Andre! ” His piece is eccentric, fast. Too fast, too lively. It ends as quickly as it began. I prefer my blues piece, played on a cello. I slowly take the stage, captivating the audience with deliberate movements. Each note is planned, each chord deliberate. There's a chilled silence in the room. It transcends past the performer, and into the music. Into the heart, mind and soul of each person sitting in the audience. “ Now when you say….each person, could they name each other? Would it be fair to assume each knows each other now? ” “ I've started to connect each person, their responsibilities and roles. ” “ Well I would say we've made excellent progress in your therapy this week. ” The doctor closes his leather-bound ledger as I turn to walk through the door.
