 Monroe and I looked at the body. It was an odd way to die, a crazy contraption consisting of a gun, a clamp, and various mechanisms and electronics that had presumably pulled the trigger. It seemed like a very complicated way to kill yourself. On the positive side, it was suicide which was still plenty of annoying paperwork, but considerably less trouble than a murder investigation. “ Do you think it's true? ”, I asked Munroe. “ Seems like bullshit, but who knows? ” I reread the note one more time: > Quantum Immortality Experiment # 160. By now, I am absolutely certain that the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics is true. Every day, I trigger the quantum random number generator with a 50/50 chance, and thus far, every day I have survived. The odds of this event happening are 1 in 2^159, which is essentially impossible. Unless *all possible things* happen, in which case I have died in many universes but this is the one where I lived. Until now. > > If you're reading this note, you're in a universe where I died on the 160^th attempt. But don't worry. In another universe I'm still very much alive. Sorry for the body. I wondered if this was some sort of physics breakthrough that would shake quantum physics, or just a garden variety nutter. I considered what to do… I pushed the button on the quantum random number generator, and looked at the result. * **Heads**: I called my sister, who taught engineering at a local community college. She was no science genius, but she knew people who knew people, and the news got passed along. As I understand it, it's a pretty
