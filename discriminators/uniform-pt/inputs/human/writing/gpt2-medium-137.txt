 When I see people, I see numbers. Just floating there. I can't remember since when it's begun, but that's not important. An innocent baby would measure as 1. A fellow high school student, typically a 3 or 4 - there's a lot of stress involved. The day before my best friend stabbed his entire family to death and hung himself, he was abnormally quiet - a 9. Just seeing a living being's image is enough: on television, the rioters at Ferguson measured around 6 and 7. When I was daring enough to watch videos of ISIS members committing atrocious murders: a 9. That day the transfer student came, something was off. His slow, calm stroll into the classroom, the way he looked off at every one of us with no cold, emotionless eyes. What caught my eyes was the number above his head: a big fat zero. No person I had ever met measured that low. So how? How was it possible? Were my numbers inaccurate all along? A solemn day after, I detoured from my usual path home to pick up groceries at the market. On my way back, I glimpsed a horrific sight in an alleyway: a student lying in the alleyway, his arms detached, his leg being steadily sawed at. Kneeling next to him was the transfer student, whistling without a care in the world. Above his head, a one accompanying the zero I had once seen. A ten. As he carried out his work, his glance flickered over and his tune stopped, replaced by a cold smirk. His number ticked down: 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. 0\. The last thing I saw before the knife.
