 I'd had the ring for some time now, and I still couldn't figure out what it did. I knew it was special because I could feel whispers of the power it contained, but I had no way to unlock its full potential. The closest that I came to being able to use it was when my old college football team won the national championship and I got really excited. The whispers became shouts, but I still couldn't use any of the power. It just kind of shot through me and into the ground, like lightning through a lamppost. That was the only clue I got: the ring's power was unlocked by a certain emotion. I think it was some form of happiness, but I wasn't sure. So I did what I could to be happy. I got a better job, moved out of my old apartment into a small house. My car worked perfectly, and my fridge was always full. But no matter how happy I was, the ring wouldn't do anything for me, and there was always something missing. Then one day, I decided to ask Megan out on a date. I had met her on a community forum online, and we started talking. Since the forum was related to local events, I knew that she had to live in the area. After we talked some more and got comfortable, I took her out. We had a nice meal, and walked along the riverfront for a while. Then we went back to my house to watch a movie and talk. I guess the date must have worn Megan out more than I thought, because partway through the movie, she fell asleep on my shoulder. I just sat back and relaxed, and realized that I had everything I could want in life. I was perfectly content. Then the whispers of power from the ring became shouts, then the shouts became instinct. The ring was quiet, but it was different. I could use it. That's when I realized that the only time I could use the ring was when I was completely happy with my life.
