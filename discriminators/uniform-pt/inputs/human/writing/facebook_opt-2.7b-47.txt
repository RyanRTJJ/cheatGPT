 It had happened gradually, this change that had come upon you. It had begun innocently, with a hopeful wish: Let me escape the chaos and pain of my life. And every day, for eight hours, your wish came true; every day, for eight hours, you dreamt. The very first dreams you had were of fantastical worlds where you were the hero, where everything went your way and you could do no wrong. There were dragons, foul beasts to be slain, villains to thwart, evil kings to overthrow, damsels to be saved. You were happy to be wanted and needed, even if it was only in your dreams. But good things do not last and those tales soon lost their glamour. Riding off to slay the dragon and rescue the princess, leading a nation's people in revolt against a corrupt king, these things that had once excited you had become boring, tedious, repetitive. So you shifted the focus your dreams. You decided that escaping into fantasy was no longer an option, but escaping into your own reality had untold potential. Every event, every moment in your life where things had not gone your way; where God, the Devil, someone had given you the finger and shoved you off the road, all of those moments could be relived and rectified in your dreams. You weren't going to escape your reality; you were going to augment and manipulate it to your liking, even if only for eight hours a day. Every night, you went to sleep worn out, reliving your unhappy moments. Every night, you dreamt, rewriting those very same moments. Every morning you woke up feeling relieved. Every morning you woke up with the vague feeling that you had a good dream. Every day you rewrote your reality in your dreams and dreamed about your reality. Yet good things do not last. One day you don't remember going to sleep. One day you don't remember waking up. One day has become eternity, a paradise turned into hell.
