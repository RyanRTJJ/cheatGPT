 "What can a civilization 200 cycles away from us do? All we would do is drag their hidden planet into our war and get them destroyed. They are still infants and would be of no help." "You are mistaken knowledge with intelligence. Yes we have more knowledge, but it is questionable who is more resourceful. They have reached the point of exponential growth by themselves and the rate of their development is unparalleled. Their curiosity knows no bounds and they will never be satisfied with what they currently possess. There is little doubt among our experts that if given our technology they will learn it, integrate it, and adapt it to their own. According to our studies they would have discovered us within 50 cycles and eclipsed our technology with 400. They are restless. More importantly, they are from an extremely hostile world. No other planet with such a dense population of life and unpredictable weather patterns ever gave birth to a sentient race. They have prospered in the face of plagues, diseases, and famine. This is a civilization forged through hell fire and emerged on the other side with indomitable will. Their entire history is marked with one war after another war. In the end these are entities who will do everything they can to survive. Trust me when I say, they will sacrifice and they will fight. The only question remaining is that what happens when we unleash a wildcard upon our galaxy.
