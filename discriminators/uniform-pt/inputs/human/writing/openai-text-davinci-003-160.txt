 At first it was shocking, But then it became normal, How she tells me I'm good, and that I belong; How she rubs my back and the space below my neck. I try not to cower or growl when she holds out a treat. I snatch it carefully from her hand, then swallow quick. I can feel my tail wagging, imploring me to trust her. Trust it this time. It is not like before. She is wonderful. The way she smells of lavender and watermelon. She says I'm good. I try to believe her. * The small ones want to play with me. They have balls and sticks. They have bones that taste like fresh meat and open meadows and purpose. Their tiny hands and high voices mean they need someone to guard them. I want to guard them, but when they touch me or call me from behind, When I can't see them coming, I can't be certain it is them And not the ones from before. The ones I couldn't make happy, Who I could not even protect myself from, Who said I was bad. When the small ones come from behind, I bark at them, Showing my teeth. They run from me and hide. I hate myself. They tell me I'm good, but before I was bad.
