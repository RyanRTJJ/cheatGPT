 The day started like any other day. You know; get up, take a shower, hop on the city bus, check out everyone's mentality ratings.... Oh yeah, did I mention? I can see people's mentality. I guess it's kinda like a "Stranger-Danger" sense. For instance, a sweet little kid might get a 1 or 2 (I swear, most kids I know are more like 4, but anyways....) and a serial killer would get probably a 8 or 9. I don't know for sure, can't say I've ever met one in person. See, I have to actually be looking at them for me to be able to tell. TV and pictures don't count. I don't know why I have this power, it's just something that comes naturally to me. I'm 17, and I learned fairly quickly that I couldn't tell others about my.... gift. They wouldn't understand! So.... Why am I telling you all this? Well, that's the thing. We just got back from Fall Break, and there was this transfer student. A boy, about my age. Looked rather average, really. In
