 Sometimes the happiest of stories have the saddest of beginnings. I grew up in a desert. My family had little money and we had little to eat or drink. I remember playing soccer with the kids on my dusty street. It is perhaps the only fond memory I have of that time. One day, a few men came to visit our small town. They told me they wanted to give young men like me a job. I asked if they had food and water. They assured me they had this and much more. They spoke of the accepting community, the proficient educational system, and the rather pretty women. I turned to my parents. "Go," they said. "Go and make us proud." The journey was not as long as I had expected. I looked around: there were several buildings in good condition. There were dozens of kids my age walking around with food and water. It was paradise. I thanked God for my luck. The next few months kind of blend together in my mind. Before we were to get to work, we had to be educated. We learned a new language. We learned how to operate machines with many buttons and switches. After months of preparation, I finally got the chance to prove myself. They gave me a chance to use my knowledge and skills in the real world. They took me to Boston. It was a place so unlike my home. I didn't know what to think of it. But it wasn't my job to think. I bought a ticket for LA, and I boarded the plane at about 7:30 AM. Soon, the plane took off. I did good.
