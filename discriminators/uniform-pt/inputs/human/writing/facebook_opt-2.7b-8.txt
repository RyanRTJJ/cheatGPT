 "Terry, its time to come in now." My mother shouted from inside the house as I played in the barn. I didn't really want to come in though, me and my friend Lexus where having so much fun pretending to be pirates. Mum said that Lexus wasn't real and that someone would be here soon to talk to me about him. I didn't like when she said that, Lexus is the greatest friend I ever had. I could tell him secrets and he'd protect me from the bullies at school because I was too small to defend myself. I said bye to Lexus and made my way to the house, the smell of freshly baked pie was overwhelming I could practically taste the different berries this made me run into the house. "Where you off to in a hurry champ?" My dad said as he picked me up and kissed me on the head. "I'm going to get some of mum's pie." I replied in excitement. He put me back down and kissed my mum on the lips. "Gross." I thought to myself. Wait till Lexus hears about this tomorrow! That was the last happy memory I had, before the woman named Jill came over to talk to me about Lexus. They put me in a hospital and watched me day and night, Lexus never turned up to see me in hospital I think I made him angry. As I lay in the bath with a bottle of wine behind me, a bottle of empty prescriptions pills and a straight razor by my side. I knew it was my time, I knew life didn't want me any more, I knew Lexus didn't care about me. Then I picked up the razor, taking it over my wrist and within one swift motion I cut my veins.
