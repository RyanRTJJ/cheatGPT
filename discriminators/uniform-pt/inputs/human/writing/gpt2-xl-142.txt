 "We have come to take you home!" The alien boomed in his most impressive voice. I stared at him. I was currently in the middle of fap session and he had just teleported in. Wasn't there like some kind rule against that? I pulled my pants up. "Mate. While I would likely have not been a very welcoming host if you had used the front door, I am downright awful when disturbed while reliving some stress." I reached over and grabbed the bat. Tested the swing a few times. "Ah what do you intend to do with that?" The blue human looking alien said "Well Mister Genie, I'm going to beat you with this bat. Since medical technology is probably more advanced on your ship, I won't hold back." I then began the beating. The fucker had vanished mid swing after a few hits. That ladies in gentleman is how I met my father in law. Turns out that we are like the racist Amish descendants of the Galaxy. Our ancestors had basically dropped on Earth with nothing but their drop capsules and zero technology to escape from the highly advanced civilisation. We had been recently rediscovered. You might think we have nothing to offer but that's not true. Because of the advanced technology, genetic modification is done very often and casually. This means that you have strange creatures who are all technically human. We are valuable for our very genes. We are the largest concentration of people with a completely pure Human genome. Even the ones who look exactly like us are different. The reason we are also valuable is that we can breed with almost every species in the galaxy. Since our genome is Pure Human, other races can have offspring with Earth Humans and produce stronger children. This is important because some races are so different it makes it impossible to breed with other members of the human races,
