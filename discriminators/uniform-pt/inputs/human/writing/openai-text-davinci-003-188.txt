 Listen to Atmosphere's In your Glasshouse to see which parts I stole. I blatantly stole but I like the result. Woke up to that familiar feeling, looking at an unfamiliar ceiling, still got your jeans on but you're topless, stomach aching, head feels nautious. Ask the barman for the time, feeling like you left it all behind. Look around to try and find a mate, you don't know how you and they relate. Tuesday morning, went to work in your car, now it's thursday, here you are. Tap your pockets to find a phone, you miss your wallet, a friend, and a home. Best idea is to stay put and wait, it's already to late, somebody might walk in and relate. Pick your shirt off the stool to your right, stomach rebels, you're losing the fight. Rush to the bathroom, find a pissoir, feels like you might've seen this before. Find some tissue to wipe your mouth, wondering what you might do now. Eyes closing, sleep kicking in, next thing you know weekend begins. Saturday, you're still on this bathroom floor, they don't know where you are, tell you that you asked before. You walk outside, stumbling into the sunshine, eyes aching to adjust they need some time. Look in front of you, there's your car. And it dawns on you where you are. Turn around to look at the bar's entry, this is your life, this is where it's ending. Stumble back in, see the bathroom stall's door, walk inside, empty, all yours. Fall asleep aching, lost and confused, might matter when you wake up, doesn't to you.
