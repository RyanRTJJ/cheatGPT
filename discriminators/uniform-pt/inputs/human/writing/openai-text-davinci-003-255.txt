 She looks to him with half a wrinkled smile, eyes shining with hope. And expectation. He supposes his own eyes had held the same shine, a lifetime past when he was in the same position as she is now. The glass tumbler in his hands trembles slightly. One sip, and the frail old lady will revert to an equally frail baby, and he will hold her and feed her and clean her for years. She had always been a.... *difficult* child. Every time. He tried to raise her differently each time, tweaking his parenting, trying to improve. It was exhausting, really. The first time, he had only been twenty when she took that dangerous sip; her'immortality' took his youth away from him. And it did so again. And again. And again. And now she looks to him with eyes halfway to pleading, one shaky hand reaching in the direction of the doorway where he stood. Every forty years, they had agreed. She had given him that. Every forty years, on the date they had been born to at the very beginning, from their own mothers. She can't wait to begin again. She reaches for him. The *please* does not reach her mouth. She is so *so* weak. *Give me the water*. He looks at her with an unfamiliar stony stare. And turns to leave. A *please* leaves her as a muffled croak. She can almost *feel* her heart betraying her. She catches a word before the door clicks shut. *No*. # # # EDIT: First story, only commented because thread looked dead. Please be honestly critical! _/\_
