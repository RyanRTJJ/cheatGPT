 I've got a secret. It's too important to tell anyone. They want to know, though. They keep asking me. Shouting at me. When I won't tell them the secret they hurt me. At first they would only hit me but I still wouldn't talk. Then they drowned me. Over and over. I found a trick though. If I break myself they can't make me speak. So I bit my tongue off. It hurt, but I won. As the blood joined the water burning in my lungs I died again. And they woke me up again. They were upset at the blood. They beat me until I nearly drowned again on the blood in my mouth. Now every time I wake there is a lump of charcoal on the rough stone floor of my chamber. I didn't win. I could still tell them if I wrote with the charcoal. I'm not free. I can only be free if I can't tell them. They won't let me die if I can still tell them. They don't drown me now. They have a file, a rasp. They drag it across my shins. There is no pain that compares.
