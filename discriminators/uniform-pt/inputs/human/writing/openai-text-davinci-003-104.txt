 "Is this a big joke? How did he climb the polls so quickly?" "It's just a stupid meme, probably." "No way, I think it's symbolic. You know, something about how we don't need the president, and that the power should go to the people." "Well whatever it was, I voted him because he's cute, unlike all the others." As the dark horse of the presidential candidates grew in popularity, so did his official partner, me. A few years ago, a strange old man with magic powers told me that I could save the world by doing this. And here we are today, waiting to see the results of the electoral college. There's a silent crowd outside, waiting like us. There are signs displaying various people and parties, but none so much as my presidential partner. To be honest, I was scared at first, but now that we've come this far, there's no going back. A short man in a business suits walks up the stage and hands a note to the announcer. The old man adjusts his glasses and unfolds the piece. From here, I can see that his expression is shocked. He takes a breathe and he slowly sulks to the stand. "People of the United States of America, meet your new president..." He takes a breathe. He's visibly frustrated. ``.... Mr. Mittens." The crowd cheers. I scruff the new president of the United States and I quickly scoop him up by the belly. I make my way to the stand and I stare at the announcer. He's cringing, I can feel it. I tap the mic twice and I prep my adorable housecat for his speech.
