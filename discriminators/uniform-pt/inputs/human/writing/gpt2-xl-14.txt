 When my wife died in the accident I went to a bad place, but I trudged on, having always been a creature of habit. Yet, I had to adjust to only cooking for one instead of two, which did not go that well.

And falling asleep on the couch in front of the TV. I woke one of those nights and stumbled towards the bathroom. The humid buildup toward thunderstorms had always given me a headache, but judging from the spinning I could not honestly divert the blame toward the weather. Get a grip I thought, and that was when I noticed it. We both used to read a lot, and throughout the years wall after wall in the small apartment had been hidden behind bookcases and shelves.

The next day I concluded that the door, being placed as it was, could not possibly lead to any room in the apartment, but I was too hungover to examine it closer. I did not sleep uninterrupted that night either, the bad weather was back again slamming the open window shut and startling me awake. I checked the window and noted that the door was still there. The cat was news though, fur dripping from the storm outside, examining the plate on the coffee table. I went for a towel from the bathroom. No necklace, no ear tattoo either. I fell asleep on the couch, still holding it in the bundle of towels. The next day I fed the cat the meatier parts of one of my leftover dinners and pulled some blankets together
