 Dear Erica, It is December 6th,2015. It has been 13 years since I found you unconscious in your bedroom, an empty pill bottle next to you. Thirteen years since I held you until the ambulance arrived and saved your life. You decided that life was worth living, that I, was worth the struggle. Thirteen years. It has been 10 years since I placed a ring on your finger. Ten years since you said yes. We decided to continue life together, a life worth living, together. Ten years. It has been 9 and a half years since we fought about you visiting your old friends and family across the country. Nine and a half years since I told you they were your biggest enablers. We decided you and our relationship were strong enough to stay clean. Nine and a half years. It has been 9 years since I was wrong about us. Nine years since I received a call that you were in the hospital, your heart had stopped. Nine years ago you survived another overdose, this time you decided to stay in your hometown. Nine years since you mailed back the ring, with a tear-stained letter, and empty apologies. Nine Years. It has been 5 years since I received your email, a cry for help, addressed to the only person
