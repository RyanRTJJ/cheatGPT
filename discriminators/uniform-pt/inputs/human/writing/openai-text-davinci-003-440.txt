 It was a breakthrough. Since the discovery of glitch-particle at CERN, thousands of scientists focused on ways to contact the outside world. All of them failed. Before this moment. It wasn't exactly a'contact'. All we found was some kind of metadata, additional information attached to our reality -- yet it was much more than anyone has discovered before. We focused on decrypting and understanding it, and after some time we were able to decode it as piece of video. So of course we sat down and watched it. Over the white background, an alien creature. It had two small black eyes and a long nose. Its head was full of green-gray feathers. The weirdest part was a dark suit -- weirdly tailored, but unmistakably human fashion. The creature opened its mouth, full of small sharp teeth, and said in perfect English: "I, Drek Mir Jun, welcome you to the 3567th season of the Land After Time. We all wonder what the future holds for us. Some of us think a day ahead, some months, some years. But what about a million years? A comet hitting the Earth, turning the skies black. What if we don't survive? What if the civilization is lost? What if, millions of years after, mammals gain sentience? You'll find those answers in the Land After Time. A new simulation technology allows us to see the raise and the fall of empires, fashion, technology -- all based on just a few initial parameters. Will there be a nuclear war? A global warming? A new rock group? A new way to wear a suit? A colonization of Mars? That and more on the Land After Time. The monkeys always deliver!"
