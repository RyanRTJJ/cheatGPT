 "Ah shit" I whispered as I heard the van pull up. They weren't supposed to be back for a week. "Tell me about it" a voice whispered back. The sound of it made me jump, and then immediately freeze. I'd been made. "Mate, you look like you've seen a ghost" the voice whispered "What?" I said, thinking about how that comment wasn't really contextually appropriate "It was a joke because I'm.... you know what, nevermind" the voice said, and my eyes finally adjusted to see my companion. "Oh! Because you're a ghost. That's funny." I said without laughing. It was at this point that we heard the door being unlocked. "They aren't supposed to be back for another week. What gives?" the ghost said to me, and I gave him a firm nod in agreement. From downstairs we could hear a distant voice loudly saying "Crikey mate, I'm Gary from Ghost Adventures. What we've got here is a real beauty - this house is the most haunted house in the neighbourhood. Maybe even in the whole world" "Why is he pretending to be Steve Irwin?" the ghost asked me and winked. I laughed in spite of myself. The downstairs voice must have heard us, because within moments they were clambering up the stairs - commentating the whole time. Ghosty and I locked eyes. He clearly didn't want to be on national television, and I didn't want to be in national prison - so when the Ghost Hunters opened the door I did the only thing that made sense and shot them both to death. Problem solved. -- - Less than pleased with how abruptly this one ends, but I really got stuck on it and I have other things to do. Like.... eat.
