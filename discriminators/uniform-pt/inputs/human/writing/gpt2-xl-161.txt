 Sand, fuckin sand as far as the eye can see. Still sand everywhere, sand and heat. Finally on the horizon a shine catches the eye, could it be after days in this god damn desert a sign of water? If I had the energy I'd run but every step is torture, slowly, slowly I edge closer until at last I'm there. Its a lush desert oasis. I sink into the water whic is hot from the sun and break down into tears, I had to leave her she couldn't go on, I couldn't carry her it made no sense for us both to die. I cup my hands and pull some water to my lips, it feels hot, grainy and dry, I start coughing and in an instant the oasis is gone. Everything is sand again. As I pull myself to my feet I hear the crack of a whip, the doom riders are out again looking for something worth stealing, they already took my water and turned me loose like some sick joke to wander out here until the sun gets me, as they get closer I hear another crack this time louder and deeper, it seems like its coming from all around me. Then. Slowly. Drop by drop. Water is falling from the sky, like magic the water pours over my skin, it fills my open mouth, fills me with vigour. This continues for days then dissapears but some water stays in lakes and streams, the sand slowly turns to grass, flowers bloom and animals return. I venture out to find her body hoping the doom riders haven't eaten her. After a few hours I spot her lying beside the same rock where we parted, as I approach I think I see some movement,
