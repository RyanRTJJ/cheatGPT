 My dirty mouth had always been something I needed to work on. For what felt like the first time since I was old enough to curse I had actually gone a few days without swearing once. For something so small, I was actually pretty proud of myself. Then, one morning after an entire swear-free week, this plain jar ended up on my desk one day. I asked around, it didn't seem to belong to anyone and no one else knew how it got there. "Well, fuck" I muttered to myself, only to then see a dollar bill materialize in the jar in front of me. The first time I swore in over a week, and now I'm getting rewarded for it? I always thought whatever being runs this show had to have himself a sense of humor. This jar was magical, and I had no idea what the hell to do with it. I checked it countless times in the next few days to make sure I hadn't lost my damn mind. Stubbed my toe? Dollar in the jar. Burned myself at work? Dollar in the jar. Idiot ran me off the road? A fresh tenner in the jar. I had to use this gift, but I had no idea how. In the face of this dilemma I did what I always did when my mind hit such a blank, I started writing. After a few feverish days, I had a damn notebook full of ideas. Pages and pages of filthy song lyrics and scripts that would make Tarantino blush, anything that could get me swearing into a microphpone or camera. I don't know if that jar had anything to do with it, hell I don't particularly care, but that shit was good too. Before I knew it I was fucking rolling in it, enough money to quit school and do this full time. Before long, I made it here. And that's the origin story behind Swear Jar Entertainment. Unless you have a reason to keep wasting my time, get the fuck out of my office.
