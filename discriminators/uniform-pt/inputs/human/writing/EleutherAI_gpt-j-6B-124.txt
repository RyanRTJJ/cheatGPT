 I walked towards the basement of one of the largest buildings in the city. An officer lifted the police tape for me and I ducked under and continued on my way. Police held back a terrified crowd that were for some reason not fleeing to a safe distance. Maybe they realised there was no point. From what I'd been briefed on this bomb already, if it went off, it would probably take out half the city. I don't know. To be honest, I wasn't really listening. The technical aspects of bombs bore me. I just choose a wire and go snip! And the thing is, I've never snipped the wrong wire. I finally approached the bomb. One of the squad members had already removed the outer casing. I liked it when they did that. It made it easier for me. I knelt down and looked at the bomb. Four wires. Red, blue, green and yellow. I made a show of looking at where each wire went, but it didn't matter. I pulled a pair of clippers from my pocket and reached in and snipped. What people don't know is that in three timelines, the bomb exploded and wiped out a significant chunk of the city, killing me and several million people. But there is always one timeline where I cut the correct wire, and that is always the one I'm on. Wouldn't make sense for me to be on a timeline where I die, right? With the bomb disarmed, I walk out of the building to the cheers and adulations of the crowd and the police officers. They all love me. No one knows that I don't know anything about bombs. I don't even know which colour wire I cut. My eyes were closed when I snipped that wire. Each choice we make creates an alternate timeline. The secret to my skill is knowing there is always going to be a timeline where you succeed. It's pretty simple, really.
