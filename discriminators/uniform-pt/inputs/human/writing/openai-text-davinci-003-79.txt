 The mesmerizing sand made up of metals not yet named whipped around her feet, In a rush to a destination unknown to both of them. The building in front of her was beautiful but weathered. Like it wasn't designed to handle the sand that kept finding its way inside the cracks, one grain at a time. It was submerged at the base too, the doorway more appropriate for human height than whatever, or whoever, lived here previously. Any paint would have been long chipped away, though for all she knew they could have been colorblind. She took a step inside, her suit protesting against the heavy strain of gravity, whipping up more of the Teal sand as she went. The building had been sunk deeper into the sand on one side and was currently tilting ever so slightly. It was a disorienting sensation to be sure. She knelt down to sweep the now stationary sand off the floor, only for it to reveal wonderful patterns depicted beneath. She smiled slightly to herself at this completely alien expression of art, she lived for these moments. She marked the building on the display attached to her suit, they would need to revisit this one later. For now, she walked back out and looked toward the horizon. There lay the impossibly large vessel, at least 15 times the size of their own ship, deeply entrenched in the sand. Most of their efforts were set on getting inside, and it was proving difficult indeed, but Irene was more than happy to go around exploring the remnants of a people turned to dust in the solar winds of time. After all, we owed them that much.
