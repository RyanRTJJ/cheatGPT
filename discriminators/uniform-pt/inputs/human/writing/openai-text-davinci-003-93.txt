 At a eye shop in the year 3,000 three people walked in at the same time. A little pink robot the shape of an egg welcomed them, asking what would they like today? Cindy, the most gregarious of the three, spoke first. She said, "I'm getting my eyes changed to blue today." Mark, the most passionate of the three said, "I'm getting my eyes upgraded to the new model" Lisa, the most curious of the three, said "I'm not sure. What do you all think?" "Oh," said Cindy "definitely a color change! You want to see the person you want to be in the mirror!" "No way," said Mark, "you should get the upgrade. You'll be able to see colors you've never even imagined" Lisa thought for a moment and said, "Oh they both sound nice, but I still can't decide. Why are you getting yours?". "My neighbor got them and says people really like her a lot more! Can't have enough friends! I always say", Cindy did say. "Because I want to expand my self, be better. So I can better serve man-kind." Mark said. "Again both sound really good. Maybe I'll think about it. Whats the worse that could happen if I didn't get one?" Lisa wondered. Mark and Cindy said at the same time, "You could be unhappy!" Before Lisa could ask another question the little pink robot beeped and announced that Mark and Cindy's appointments had come. They both walked down the hall to the surgery suites. Lisa didn't get new eyes that day. New eyes, she decided, where some thing unhappy people got. She could have any thing she wanted. So, she wondered if she'd ever find what happy people wanted.
