 At first, the tattoos were simply a universal experience. One day everyone woke up with a tattoo on their chest. Everyone except me. It was quite the sensation, as religions and scientists clamored to explain the phenomenon. Everything was wild speculation for the first day. Then, it became painfully clear. I guess the most obvious hint was all the elderly with tattoos of them in bed or in wheelchairs. Another one of the obvious hints to their meaning was from the car crash victims that day. Every single person who died in a car accident, had cars crashing on their chest. Everything about this was crazy. How did the tattoos get there? Were they always the way you died? Could you avoid them? I remembered hearing of a news story where a man with a plane crashing on his chest vowed to never fly again. The story was note worthy because a plane crashed into his home. His wife and child had tattoos of them in hospital beds; they died hours later after they had been taken to the hospital. It seemed inevitable. But then what did that mean for me? That I was immortal? I started getting reckless. Who cared? People were starting to get crazy. A lot of crazy theories as to what was happening started gaining traction. Large chunks of religious groups became radical, claiming the apocalypse was coming. I was in crazy dangerous situations, but I never died. I became a hero, fighting off rioters, saving people who probably weren't meant to die anyway. It wasn't until a tanker carrying bleach exploded that I realized that maybe I didn't have a tattoo since bleach cleans so well.
