 I crawled off the air mattress, shrugged off the girl I didn't know the name of, and limped outside. To my shock, it smelled even stronger of alcohol outside than it did inside. I could hear a sickly moaning in the distance, but at the time I figured it was some poor sap losing last nights booze in the woods somewhere. I drove back to the dorm, blissfully unaware of the complete lack of traffic at what would have normally been rush hour. I got back in the dorm and did as I did every morning as I came to, I turned the TV on to the news. The news was unbelievably dire, a visibly distraught anchorman giving the details of what was basically the end of the world. They believed it had something to do with alcohol, believe it or not. Some contaminated yeast, shipped all over the world, gave rise to something called prions as it fermented. These prions worked their way into the brain after consumption, turning the victims into something not different from a typical Hollywood zombie. Unsurprisingly, this apocalypse started on the college campuses. From there, it spread throughout the western world, creating a somewhat comical wave of undead drunkards spreading this illness through their alcoholic essence. In this condition, the undead were rather easy to deal with, the majority being dispatched by the armed members of the populous within a matter of months. We didn't know what to do after that, we still don't to tell the truth. There's about 400 million left on Earth, in comparison to the seven and a half billion when it started. I feel like it's safe to say no one's doing much drinking nowdays, which is a bit of a problem
