 I sat in the office, stunned. "Janitor? JANITOR? That's my best option!!?? I have an IQ of 207!!" The assessment agent sighed. "Yes, you do. But so do millions of others. I'm afraid without an IQ of at least 210, your options are quite limited." I didn't know what to say. 3 points. 3 points destroyed my life. 3 points stood in the way of me achieving great things. "Let me retake the test, I'll study harder, I'm sure I can get to 210." I pleaded. Another sigh from the agent. "Look... do you realize how many other people say the same thing? You can't change your results. Even if you could, so would everyone else, and then the bar would be higher. You have to accept the fact that while you are highly intelligent, you are not exceptional. I'm sorry." He closed my file and left the room. What was I to do? I knew there was no way I could live my life this way. I needed stimulus. I needed fulfillment. I needed a challenge. I knew what I had to do. I walked out of the assessment room, up the seven flights of stairs, and opened the door to the roof. Without hesitation, I walked right off the edge. ______________ So began the end of human civilization. 90 % of the population committed suicide one way or another. Without workers, everything collapsed. Water distillation ceased. Crops died. Electricity failed. All the scientists, doctors, and the rest of the top 10 % could do was watch as their world collapsed. Edit for spelling
