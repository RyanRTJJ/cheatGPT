 Diary of Amelia Greene I have never been a good writer, but I feel my experiences should be recorded in case I disappear. 12/1/14 I feel it. Everything around me is moving differently. I told my best friend, and she thinks I am joking. People just seem to be more choppy, everything people do looks like some sort of flip book. Going to an eye doctor next week.:) 12/8 My eyesight is above average. The effects have worsened. Now everything is so choppy I am having trouble doing simple tasks, and communicating with other people. The only thing I can fluently see and use is this diary and my grandmothers pen. 12/16 All communication with the outside world is gone. I feel invisible. I watch my family, crying, searching. The world "updates" the frame about once an hour. I am about to go insane. Everywhere I go people are frozen. I wait every day for the next hour to pass just so I can see my mom move, even if it's just enough to see her blink. I'm not sure how long I can take this. 12/23 I tried to kill myself 7 times. Because I can not pick up objects in this world or cause any movement I had to force myself to bash my head against a concrete wall. I think I may be stuck forever. 12/25/14 It was midnight last night. As I lay on the floor bedroom floor weeping A huge boom shook the house. Ever since then everything has been still. 12/25/ There are others. I see them outside, congregating and talking. I can not use the doors and escape, because all objects besides the diary are frozen in time. I am about to come up the chimney, and can not take this diary with me as I climb (I have always been a little clumsy). Until I can free myself
