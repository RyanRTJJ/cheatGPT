 "Come my children. Come and listen to a tale of old. A tale of destruction at the beginning of our time." They came in moving mountains set ablaze. Falling from the skies, creating a blanket of black ash in their wake. The first touch of their behemoths onto our land was a kiss of death. Whole tribes were extinguished when their mountains fused with the soil, crushing them in scorching fire. We cried out in anguish at the loss of connection. 100,000 Scrahn blinked out of existence in a single, terrifying moment of confusion. That wasn't the end. The mountains started shaking and changing. Tentacles reached out and stabbed the earth with malicious intent. Only evil spirits could explain the unnatural motions. Beams of the sun also pierced our land from the heavens. To approach them meant only death. A *Great Marhyrm King*, a being of power and strength would shrink from the site. Then all was still for 4 moon passings. Then *it* came out of a opening. A pet behemoth. It moved from its mother and destroyed its surroundings, consuming them within its maw. Smoke rose from it and the heat could be felt from afar. However, that was but a foreshadowing of the true death of our lands. The machine kept moving never stopping as it consumed all life. More of them appeared from the other mountains and every few hours another type of monster would appear to desecrate what remained. Three more moon passings and our land is but waste. The pets return to their cages and a something else climbs out. An imp. A servant of the mountain. The sounds it emits is the same every time; every cycle of 6,000 moons. The words, for that must be what they are, have been passed down litter after litter. To foretell and to warn. "The carbon harvest on P-1056 is complete, boss. Requesting dispersion of terraforming material. Let's get these puppies back on the road to P-1057 for more of the C's!" "Permission granted."
