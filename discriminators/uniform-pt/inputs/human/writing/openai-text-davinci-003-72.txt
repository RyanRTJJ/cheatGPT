 The wizard- no, janitor- huffed in frustration, leaning against his ladder and working the doorjamb as best he could with a screwdriver. The stupid door was stuck. If he could just use his damn powers he could have it fixed in a trice. He moved to replace the screwdriver with his wand, but stopped, chastening himself for being so quick to turn to magic to solve his problems. "Maybe it's a penny," called out a young voice. The wizard blinked once, twice, then turned and eyed the man who spoke. He stood somewhat uncertainly, leaning forward slightly, dressed in the light blue scrubs of an intern. "A penny," the wizard echoed. And suddenly he recalled the young man from earlier, standing over the doorjamb and cursing his luck at having dropped the penny. A dark look crossed his face, "You stick a penny in the doorjamb?" he questioned. The wizard watched the young man, waiting to see if he had the courage to admit his mistake. The medical intern's eyes widened and he quickly backpedaled, "What? Me? No I wouldn't do something like that." His lips pursed with guilt as he looked down, then off to the side, before hurrying off in the same direction. The wizard- no, janitor- scowled. The young man had failed his test of character. But perhaps he could yet learn. The janitor nodded to himself in satisfaction. Yes, he would be this young man's test of mettle for as long as he worked at this hospital, for as long as he was a doctor here at Sacred Heart, the wizard would play janitor.
