 I've seen the cruelty of men. I've survived the American civil war both world wars, encountered countless instances of slaughter and genocide. Seen entire species wiped off the face of the earth. Today is special for me, you see, today I become recalled and I will give my report to the council. After a few hundred years on a forsaken, dying planet it will be good to be home. My team had descended on earth around 1850 in your human years. We all blended in quite well I thought. We were horrified at what we saw. Humans are a quite cruel species, if we couldn't have taken your form it would quickly have ended our work on earth. As I understand I am the last remaining survivor of the task force, the human purge has been quite effective of ending my work. I don't think I'll miss it here, while humanity can be quite devout and loving I fear this is not the future you have left for your children, and by that, mine either. My species was only interested in you and your development it had taken us a long time to find you. But your persecution had sealed your fate. You have unknowingly chosen to hate instead of love, to kill instead of heal, to destroy instead of build. I wish you luck humans, but the fact is that, you are simply incompatible with life forms, when the world burns we will watch from the sky's;
