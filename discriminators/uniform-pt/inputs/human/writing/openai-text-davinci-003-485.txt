 Dear Reader You have probably found this note by now. You see I made a grave mistake of wearing a seemingly ironic costume since the turn of events that transpired. It started at 3 pm you see the blizzard approached out of no where perhaps hinting towards a series of unfortunate events. Around 4 pm people were gathered not being able to leave they sat and talked. Then it happened a man died in the restroom surprisingly no one saw or even were in the area when the event transpired. I found him and told the crowd the reaction I received was one I didn't expect they scoffed and laughed and thought it was a joke. Finally after they discovered I told the truth they said "you are Sherlock Holmes aren't you supposed to find the killer". Seemingly a twisted joke since this was the life of a man that perished I took the challenge and determined a great idea to catch the man I sought. You see the note of which I have left was hidden in the pockets of the dead man which we shall call toby funny thing was he seemed to work at a paper company what a bore he must have been. I was also the only one who was allowed access to the body. Well after much time had passed the note disappeared exactly as I had hoped you see how did you end up reading this piece of work. It is time to look up from this note for you are now under arrest.
