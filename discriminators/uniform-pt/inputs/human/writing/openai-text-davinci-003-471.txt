 Dear Michael; I do not even know where to start. I am sorry. I am sorry it took me to long to love you. I'm sorry I toyed with your emotions like a bored house cat toying with a mouse. I am sorry I abandoned you when you needed me most; that I was too engulfed in drowning my troubles in substances to see how badly you were hurting. Maybe I just blamed you being on the road the majority of the time. I thought I was strong enough for long distance, but I eventually caved in to my boredom. I acted like we were worlds apart when in reality it was a simple three hour car ride to see someone who I would kill to see right now. And I guess that's what makes me feel the worst, I could not stay sober for a measly three hours to go see you and be reminded that all could be right in the world. I am so worried about you Michael. I worry about you all the time. I hope your attempt on you life was the only one you try in your lifetime. If I found you to succeed in a future attempt I would lose the one ray of sunshine I have. Even if you continue to ignore me and never speak to me again, nothing would make me happier than seeing you find someone who loves you and you two to grow old together. It
