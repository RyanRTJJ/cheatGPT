 Honestly, do you know how hard it is to perfectly emulate someone? There are a million mannerisms, a billion things to know, and depths to a person's character that aren't immediately obvious when done right but are glaringly obvious when done wrong. Once the first of us were found and people knew that there were shapeshifters among them, the rest fell quickly as you humans started connecting the dots. Me? I chose a different approach, one deemed insane by everyone I knew. I studied human anatomy, growth, and development much more closely than my colleagues. Then, when I thought I was ready, I transformed myself into a baby human and left myself outside a church. They took me in. They placed me with a human couple. I acted the part of the innocent child named Ted. I went to school. I learned their history and their culture from their own teachers, people who *expected* me to be ignorant in those things. And when my own kind started getting caught, I was horrified but extremely smug at the same time. Nobody suspected me. My own personality, filtered through a human guise, was everything the humans knew about me; there weren't the normal discrepancies because I hadn't replaced anyone. I was a character of my own creation. It's been twenty years now since the last of my kind was caught. People were still paranoid, but since no shifter has been detected in that time, the humans are starting to calm down. That paranoia, however, was good for me. People took the time to get to know each other better, just in case one of their own was ever taken and replaced. The government instituted a policy that says all salaried employees have to take breaks in pairs so that they can spend time getting to know each other. That's how I met my wife, Andromeda. Now if only our daughter, Nymphadora, would stop changing her hair color. -- - *A/N: Why yes, it is a Harry Potter
