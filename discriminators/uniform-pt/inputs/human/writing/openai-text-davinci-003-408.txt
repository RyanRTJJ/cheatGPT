I hope this will be worth it." Yean had learned a little, just enough to do what he needed. He stood close to Marcel and held his hand for a second before dashing down ethereally into the canyon. Marcel followed after him just a few seconds behind. Yean's last moments were focused. You could hack even if you couldn't see the code if you just had one good line in your head, just one *good line* you really *wanted. * His line was "open" and when he hit the bottom of the canyon it crackled out of him.
