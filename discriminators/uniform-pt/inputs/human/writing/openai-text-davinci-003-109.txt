 I feel as though people think of me as a person who does not care for other people as much as myself. Well, those people are right, I hate holding other peoples babies. They are like little bald people who poop themselves and can't take care of there own self, kind of like if your grandma was 95 but small and bald, Yes your grandma. Now I don't donate to charity even though I inherited half of my family's multimillion dollar company. I don't give people money on the side of the street, they should have made a better life for themselves. So know that you know me as the asshole I am let me explain to you a story. I was walking down the road one day and just got done handling business at my company. I see this person on the side of the street, no legs and was wearing a Vietnam vet hat. He stopped me and said "sir would who please donate some money or at least food or water." I stared at him thinking to my self "My dad was a Vietnam vet before he died". So I said ok and I went to the Subway on the corner of the street. I bought a Cold Cut Combo with a water to drink. On my way back I could see the man already saying thank you before I even reached him. I stopped and stared at him again and smiled, I opened up the sub took a bite, threw it in the trash
