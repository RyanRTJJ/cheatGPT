 Legend tells of a time before music Well it wasn't really before music but back then music was just a thing you listened to and sometimes played and sometimes put together on CDs in the hopes of coitus happening so maybe music has always had power but like not this much Anyway then came The Musicians which was a combination of the M from magicians and usicians from musicians.... Humanity was kind of in a slump intellectually And so it was that the power changed hands going from the rich to the musically gifted (which was like a combination of the super rich and just depressingly poor.... and dirty.... and politically ignorant....) The Metal heads moved north because "Cold is so metal" and the wastelands helped them right their lyrics, which they swear is one of the most important parts even though no one knows what they're saying Jazz got Europe No one really knows why, sometimes life just goes its own way Canada was given over to Progressive rock because Rush America got Country The less said the better And on and on the world divided itself, because when you give humans something like magic, channeled through something like music, instead of taking a step back and realizing how dope that is they just go ahead and figure out who they should be killing.... Didn't take long before a metal head found a killer riff that could bring down an asteroid wherever the fuck they wanted and of course that shit don't fly so Proganada (humans got really bad at naming things) found a mildly fantasy sounding lyric that summoned a titan that could wreck fucking everything America just resorted to the gun thing Because half their fucking songs were about no one taking them away Even though no one fucking was because they had magic.... And you never knew what you were going to get with Jazzope (Just go with it) And even though the world had magic it was just the same old shit on a different station
