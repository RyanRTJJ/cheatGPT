 [ Punch ] (http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown) That clarity you needed, that moment necessary to pierce the bubbled fantasy of your world, it is full color lucid and needle sharp sticking in your eyes right now, now, this fucking second, NOW. It's in the screams, my god, the convulsing shaking epileptic thrashing and slaughtered animal wheezing and frothing of the hundreds at your feet. They're clutching their chests and throats and flopping like fish on a carpet after the bowl burst. And it's in this tidal roll, these gasping dying throngs, they're lying down in this convulsing collective and it's spreading them flat. Women and fathers, mothers and brothers and the children, my god why them first? You have this lucidity, but it is not an aid, not at this moment, it is far too late to help. It is only an enhancement to empathy, a karmic promise allowing you to absorb this tragedy with each witnessed passing. It is here to provide your mind time and paralysis to reckon the flood at your feet. Janet, oh Janet. Such a sweet mother. Her children are sobbing out their last pitiful moments, and you are rewarded a stabbing sympathy. Her children were as trusting as yours, and are minutes from being just as dead. And Janet, sweet soul, she takes a moment to mourn them before she rises and shambles to face you, and you exchange telepathic and pathetic anguish with crippled eyes. And she reaches behind you, past you, to the table, and takes the cup, swallows it fast, and now you watch her go. And then it's your time, but you turn and realize Janet, that cruel bitch, she drank the last cup of Kool Aid.
