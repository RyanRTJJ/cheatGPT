 this was written by an eleven year old I started to realize the mistake they had made a few weeks after I had been taken. earlier on I hadn't figured it out due to the fact the I was terrified out of my mind. Who wouldn't be? I had been abducted by aliens who were conducting experiments on me. They were surprisingly stereotypical experiments, probes, odd substances being injected into me and so on. but soon they stopped. they kept giving me food and water and making sure I was staying healthy and fit. But that was it. I had no contact with the aliens except for the occasion check up to see if I was sick or when they came to do maintenance on my enclosure. I only started to realize why when they gave me a translator. it was a little thing with a screen and an on/off switch, that was it. whenever an alien said something nearby it would translate it into English. Not long after I was given the translator greeted by a two aliens in my enclosure. They called themselves something but I can't remember what. They were frantic, as though they were desperate to leave again. "you aren't Alex Mills are you?" the first alien said with fear in his eyes "no" I replied, confused as to what was happening "we were meant to get somebody else" the second alien continued "and you have to help us, if the general finds out we are dead, just, you're Alex Mills, alright?" I nodded, showing I understood. they left in a hurry, like they had somewhere to be. It's been a week since then and I've started to notice things like names that don't match mine, information that is wrong and so on. now I'm here
