 A bright flash screams in through the windows, and a loud boom shakes the house to its foundation. I rush outside to see what had happened only to behold a telephone box at the epicenter of burnt ground in my driveway. It opens as I start to approach, and three men step out. The first two are covered in black everywhere even on their faces, but the third man I immediately recognize as my father. As he steps out he looks to me as if I was six years old again, and had broken mom's vase. He approaches me without a word with the two men behind him, and it isn't until he is on top of me that I notice something further wrong about him. My father was always taller than I was, and he never had strait blonde hair like me. "I am you" the man before me says "and you will thank me." With that he snaps, and the two faceless men rush me faster than humanly possible. They hold me by the arms, and force me to the ground. I scream and one of them grabs my face forcing my jaw open. The man claiming to be me straddles my chest, and forces his hands into my mouth. I feel a thin string enter my mouth, and begin forcing its way in between my teeth. I struggle fruitlessly as my future self flosses my teeth. After several sickening moments he rises from me, and the other men let me go. Once I am up on my feet again I see him one last time. "I'll be back tomorrow" he says with a grin full of fake teeth. Also a [ related comic you might find interesting. ] (http: //www.optipess.com/2014/07/14/important-timing/)
