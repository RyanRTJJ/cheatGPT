 It was such a beautiful day too. Then again the type of day it was rarely made much of a difference. People rushed like ants, pulsing lights of red and blue turning the shades of their white jackets. A ring of yellow tape, so thin and flimsy that the wind might tear it away, was the only wall between them and the ever growing crowd. 'Why do they come?' It was a question that he always asked himself, though he never got an answer even when he did build up the courage to ask. To walk the sea of whispers and and flashes. "What are you trying to see? What do you think you'll find? Is this entertaining to you? Then why do you have your phone out?" They would never answer him but the guilt in their eyes was enough. They would give one last glance and leave, heads ducked and clutching their phones. It always went like that and he would always wait. Wait for the whispers and flashes to stop, wait for the crowds to vanish, for the seas to dry. He would wait for the men and women in their white jackets to close and carry the large black bag away. He would wait for the pulsing of red and blue to dwindle away. He would wait for it all to end, and then he would go. He would walk the distance to the familiar yellow ring, his hands in his pockets, his hood shielding him from the cheery sun's rays. He would cross the ring and stop at the red stained concrete. Stop and stare and wonder why. "Why am I such a failure?"
