 Throughout history, we have been plagued by a single mystery. What was the meaning of our arms? We lived our entirely lives branded, our own living identification numbers, but yet, the order always seemed to be reversed. Each time the number lowered, charged, diminished, it brought with it a great change to the human race. It fell with Julius Caesar, it fell with Alexander of Macedon, Napoleon, a host of revolutionaries all within the same range too numerous to list. Then, it became clear out great scientists numbers lowered as well, all changes predicted by their number - by their genetics. I am number one. I've never felt as though I was different. Perhaps I am the great divine mistake? Perhaps, no one really was meant to be number one. I have lived my life as a normal man in an ever changing world, I've seen war, famine, strife, and disease spread across the globe. Our brightest minds have risen to the challenges of trying to save our species, and yet, we have never found that hope. Merely more death. That all changed when my purpose was discovered. When my son was born, he bore no number, instead there was a single symbol. Alpha. Like myself, he was a mystery, until that day when it all changed. He has.... powers. Different from any man alive. Some believe him to be supernatural, however, many of us realize the truth. I was not the last human to be born.
