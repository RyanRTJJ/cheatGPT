 She is driving home from an amazing date. Thinking about what a gentleman he was. How he opened all the doors for her, how he gently put his hand on her lower back as he escorted her out of the restaurant, how he looked in her eyes with such gentle loving eyes and let her talk all night. Her euphoria is interrupted by some bright lights down the road. She slows down and realizes this isn't normal. She starts to get terrified and her heart starts to beat faster and faster. She slams on her breaks when she see a creature she has never seen before. Ring! Ring! Ring! She wakes up and realizes it was just a dream, a dream she has had every night since they took her. She has finally arrived back home on Earth. She finds a stranger and asks to use their cell phone. She can't believe that after all these years she still remembers his phone number. At first he was confused and didn't know who it was, but as soon as he realized he got dressed and came to get her. "Where have you been all these years?" he asked. "You won't believe me." she stated. He looked at her and saw she was different. She was in shape, but skinnier. Her hair was short and messy. Fingernails looked like they haven't been done in a while. Her clothes were unlike any style he had ever seen. She had a few scars and her nose was crooked. "I'll listen to anything you have to say." he told her. "I'm really tired... I just spent days flying at light speed, I mean traveling. I just want to sleep for a couple days." she told him. "Off course I'm here for you." he whispered in her ear as he brought her closer to him.
