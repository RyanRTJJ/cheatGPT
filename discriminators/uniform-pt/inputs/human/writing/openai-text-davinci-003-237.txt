 I am alone. For the first time in what seemed to be eons of unrequited empathy and self-sacrifice in the name of others, I am alone. This foreign quiet comes with a whispered sigh and a dulling of emotion. For years I have pledged myself to others. Disregarded my personal wants -- my needs -- to ensure that they were kept safe and content. I have bled silently and invisibly for my friends, my family, and sometimes complete strangers without an ounce of complaint. It felt good at first. Many saw me as a friend. A hero. A savior. But no more. The betrayals. The unrequited affections from the general populace has left me broken. I was a shield for the people, now I lay jaded, fractured, and alone. Alone. Despite the uncountable amount of people I have bled for, my companion is the only one to see my descent into villainy. Only she weeps for me. It came slowly of course. Even she could not see the seeds of doubt and self-loathing that had begun to plant within, it was only until it claimed me in its dark web that the sickness began to show. The plague is visible now. It pains me to see her upset. Once a loyal and devout partner who showered me with support and affection; now a worried stranger who can not stop what is to come. She has tried and tried; unwilling to face my transformation any longer she has departed. Her scent lingers, but like any hope for redemption it has faded into near-nothingness. I am alone. My surroundings begins to blur and I slowly fall into my bed, with dreams of me playing the hero creeping on the edges of my vision.
