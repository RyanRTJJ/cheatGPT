 "We don't have much time," he says. "My battery is almost at 10 % and I can't sustain an erection in low power mode." I grin, fumbling with his belt and slipping a hand inside. He is smooth, hard, and *warm. * I lean close to his ear and whisper, "I *need* you." His hands—all four of them—tear at my blouse and pants. The servos in his fingers are too strong, too rough, and buttons from my blouse fall onto the concrete floor of the supply closet. "Jerk! I left my spare uniform at home—oh!" I gasp as two of his hands pull open my bra. I arch my back and press myself against him, against the unyielding metal of his perfect, molded chest. "Hurry," he pants. "I've turned off a few non-essential processes but I don't know how long I can last." I bat his hands away and bend down, shimmying his pants down to his wheels. Still on my knees, I look up and make eye contact with his visual sensors as I slowly trace a fingertip up his inner thigh. I stand and we kiss. He wraps his arms around me, cupping my head, my waist, my back and one arm. For a moment, I close my eyes and swoon in the warmth of his embrace. His battery beeps, loud and insistent. I open my eyes and smile as I snake a hand downwards. Suddenly, his steel feels cold in my hands. I look down between us, below his perfect chest, his perfect abs. I sigh. "Sorry," he mutters. "I told you to hurry." I step back and try to fix my ruined blouse. "Yeah, well, *I* told *you* to use Energizer." ***** If you liked this story, you
