 It was a long time since my adventure began; I can't remember how many years. It has been a good time but now, wearily, I lay my head down on my pillow to take me to that destination, where all quests end. I dimly notice that I have friends, relatives, aquaintances everyone around me. They don't want me to go, they think I will be lost, that I have no guide, that I will be alone. There is only one way to find out. I close my eyes A tunnel appears before me with a great, blinding, light at the end, it calls to me, wants me. I feel pulled towards the end like a moth to a flame. It is not forced, nor painful, but rather a desire, to discover to find what the light holds in store for me, to find what is in that great beyond, to finally know the secert - the ultimate answer. I find myself falling gently to wards the end when I hear a voice. It is a child, about 2 years old I'd imagine, shouting and sceraming for me. "Grandpa, Grandpa. I don't want you to go" There are others now to, dozens of them, some sob and whimper while others yell and cry but they all penatrate. The tugging is gone. I see them now. They look so sad. Do I have to go through with this? Is the answer that important? The answer will come for me eventually, whether I look for it or not but these people, they need me now and I don't want them to fade just yet. I take one more whistful look to the light before making my way back.
