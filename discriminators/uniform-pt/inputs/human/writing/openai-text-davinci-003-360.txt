 "Which one do you want me to explain first?" I asked. I couldn't look past the barrel of Joe's shotgun. "Why the fuck..." bellowed Joe belligerently. ``..am I naked?" I said, as I completed his sentence. "It's Thursday." Joe cocked his shotgun and said "You have three seconds to explain yourself before I blow your head off. " "Look, Stephanie works two jobs. Thursday is her only evening off work. I like to be prepare for that by first..." "Ugh, enough. Why the hell are you in my living room? "he enquired. "I was closing the window blinds when I saw your wife in the bathtub with the water flowing over. Naturally, I wanted to make sure she was alright first, so I just ran here. When I went up, she was already unconscious so I came down here to call the paramedics. That is when you showed up." Joe furrowed his eyebrows. "That still doesn't explain the hole you are standing in" he said, sounding unconvinced. "How does the hole.." Joe started again. Before he could finish his question, his eyes rolled over as a baseball bat swung right into the back of his head with a sickening crunch. Joe crumpled into the hole right beside me. "The hole was for you, you sick bastard" screamed the woman who had been unconscious only a few minutes ago. As I looked at her, utterly confused at the turn of things, she dropped the baseball bat into the hole, picked up the shotgun and looked at me undecidedly. "I guess the hole is big enough" she said. "Wait what the...." *BOOM*
