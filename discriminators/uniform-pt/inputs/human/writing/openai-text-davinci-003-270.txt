 It was a place of unrivaled surprise. It was a place where digging down one foot could yield a coin thousands of years old, or a stone implement tens of thousands of years old. It was a place where our biome had spread itself so thin that we could journey to the farthest corners of our world and still find life thriving in ways we had never thought possible. It was a place of great imagination where some of us were lucky enough to spend our lives making the world more beautiful. We could bask in the intracity of our interconnected state. We could live as we wanted. It was also a world of great discontent. The jealous few saw what the world had, and wanted it all for themselves. The constructed systems and influenced others to rob people of what they had and leave them without means to live a life of substance. These billions of haggared victims remained largely voiceless, rendered moot by the vast distances and barriers of culture which lay between them and their oppressors. These people are our legacy, it is their suffering which allowed us to live on past their extinction. We will, and we must hold it as our goal to construct a new world of freedom, of equality, and of plenty. It is not my task to do this. I am old now, it is my job to teach you what I can. It is your job to shape this world. And when you do, you must do so with the grave knowledge that you can fail. You can do as we did on earth, and allow evil men to prosper. It is far easier to do
