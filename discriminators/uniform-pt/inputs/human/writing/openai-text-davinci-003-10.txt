 Part of this I heard from a Muslim lecturer. This is how he narrated, in short. We were first created as souls and all gathered together and asked who our Lord is? In one voice all souls replied the one true God. That's why in the middle of the deepest problem who ever you worship at that time you will remember the one God. If you worship Jesus or Ram or Buddha at that movement you won't ask from any of them but ask directly from God. This is because deep inside we know the truth. Next he explained that all souls were stationed in garrisons and souls would meet each other. Sometimes they would become friends or at times would not see eye to eye with the other souls. He went on to explain that when we are born sometimes our recognition from the souls is brought with us that's why when at times meet a person for the first time yet we feel we have known that person all our lives. At times we have a brother or sister we don't get along with. Some of these things are from the soul stages. After death we than go into another waiting stage where we in part either have it good or bad depending on how we have lived our lives on earth. This will be followed by Judgement Day when will be brought before God to answer for our actions which will than lead to either eternal bliss or eternal suffering. In short that is the story of our souls.
