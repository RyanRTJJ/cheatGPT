 This is my first honest attempt at writing, constructive criticism welcome! -- - We've already had multiple vaults with different experiments which lead to me believe there wasn't much left for us to attempt. From Vault 11 with its sacrifices to Vault 34 with it's abundance of weapons and ammunition, we thought we had covered it all along with the two Vaults designed to hold a thousand males and one female and vice versa. We had everything covered, or so I thought. You may wonder, would anything surprise me at this point? The answer to that, my readers, is yes. Out of everyone hired: top-of-their-field scientists, people no one would think twice about like teenagers and low-waged employees, who would have thought that my son would be the one to surprise me. To make this clearer, my son is five years old. From what he gathers of my work, I make environments for video game characters. Convincing enough, in my opinion. I jokingly asked him one day what he'd like to see and he responded with the idea of placing one man and a box full of puppets in a vault. This experiment is quite possibly the most absurd and ridiculous one yet. My employees fought to give me the craziest ideas for a raise and who beats them all? My own son who is barely learning to count. I wish the story of this absurd vault was greater. It'd spare my employees from the humiliation of being outdone by a kid. Vault 77 was born in a child's imagination. It has a stark beauty to it doesn't it? That day, after filling out the paperwork and polishing the idea up, I went out with my son to get some ice cream.
