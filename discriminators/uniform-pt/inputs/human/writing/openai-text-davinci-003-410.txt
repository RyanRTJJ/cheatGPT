 The bright flash fills the sky, breaking through the rain as I was huddled in my cave. The'boom' that comes shortly after scares the mother of my children and her children. I am scared too, though I'll never admit it. I have to act strong so the other men don't steal my woman or my hunting grounds. With these thoughts in my head I get up the courage to go out and investigate. Following where I saw the brightest part of the flash, I walk through the dark forrest. I know the area so well that I don't trip on any of the downed branches or bushes. But there, suddenly, I see light when I go around the tree. It's a light I've never seen before, red and warm looking. At this point my curiosity overwhelms my desire to look brave and strong in my motivation and I hurry toward the light, stumbling as I rush in. There is the source of the light. It's a flickering, see-through mass on top of that downed tree. The rain is pelting it and distorting it as if it was attacking, but no matter how much the rain is falling, the light keeps standing up higher and higher. I walk up to the light and it's hot. The light feels hotter than the rocks of my cave do after a day in the warmest part of the year when I don't need to wear my pelts.
