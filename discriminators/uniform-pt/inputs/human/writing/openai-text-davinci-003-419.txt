 Many seek the Golden Sword. Many have found it, many have lost it, many have never even touched it. Many have fought and died for it. Some have hidden it that it may not be found, only for another to stumble upon it. Every one who has placed their hand upon it has attempted to keep it forever. To call it their own. All of them have been destroyed. Not a single one has kept the Golden Sword forever. Those who seek it, have no rest until they find it. Those who have found it, have no rest until they lose it. Those who seek it, will fight to find it. Those who find it, will fight; that no other may place their hands upon it and call it their own. All of them perished. Not a single one succeeded. The Golden Sword remains; ripping into the hearts of those who seek it. Those who want the Golden Sword are molested by it. They are restless trying to find it, and restless trying to hold onto it. They are not available for anything else. How long will they stumble over themselves for that which is unattainable? How long will they fight for that which will kill them? The Golden Sword remains; tearing through the flesh of the wanting men.
