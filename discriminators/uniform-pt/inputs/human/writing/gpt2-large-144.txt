 "Millions of dollars, thousands of hours of research and development, and finally we have something to show for it." The labcoat-clad man coughed into his hand, not used to speaking in front of a crowd. In front of him stood the greatest leaders of the nation - renowned scientists, generals, politicians, and CEOs. His hands fell to rest upon a shining cherrywood podium, and he continued his speech. "Today, ladies and gentleman, I would like to introduce the new age of military."

The body count was easily in the thirties already, all hostiles, and the unit's tempo showed no signs of slowing. The scientist smirked, pleased beyond measure with how this was turning out.
