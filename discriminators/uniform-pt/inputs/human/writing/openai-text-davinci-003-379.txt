 It's a stormy night in the land of Veron, the streets are relatively empty in this shady part of town. Everyone knows codename MP is inside the tavern, right now, grabbing all the quests and maybe purchasing some consumables he may or may not use. We've trained for years perfecting our very specific roles and failure is not an option, and it's my time in the spotlight, this is my moment! The world seems to materialize around me and I know that it's go time. Horse leading in front of the carriage at a breakneck pace, I grip the reigns tight as I can. I pull the cloak up around my head, just as I practiced; Now's not the time he discovers my identity. But as I draw near, I notice something isn't quite right. I'm approaching the front of the tavern and I see the MP walk out, clad in armor and equipment perfectly optimized for the time he's spent here, but for some reason he doesn't seem to pay any mind to my speeding carriage. Soaking in the moment, MY moment, I failed to notice that while my carriage and horse was making full contact on the ground, there wasn't an audible noise to be heard. By then, it was too late. I careen into a head on collision with the star, the MP. I hop down to check if he was alive, but slowly came to the realization that none of this was tailored anymore, we're off script and I'd have to improvise. Seizing the moment, I drag the beloved MP behind the Tavern, adorn his gear, and awkwardly stuff him inside an empty barrel nearby. Now it's really Carriage Driver # 1's time
