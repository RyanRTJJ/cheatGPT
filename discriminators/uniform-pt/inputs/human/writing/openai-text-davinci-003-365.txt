 Two mayan astronomers are sitting back on couple baskets of beans at the top of one of the mayan pyramids, after having just completed the calendar, smoking some ancient precolumbian cigars. Acan: Eh, Atan, we fucking did it. We finished the fucking calendar. Atan: Yeahhhhh, man. Acan: You think we should make the next one? Atan: Wha? Acan: Man, you heard me. Stop drinking that fucking maize wine and let's get to work on the next one. Atan: Acan, we made that calendar to last two thousand years and shit. I think we can take a break. Acan: Yeah, you're right. We got thousands of years before this one runs out. Atan: We'll do it tomorrow. It's not like shit's gon na happen when this calendar runs out. Acan: Man, you know what bitches are gon na say when they see this calendar? They're gon na say what the fuck happens when this calendar runs out? Is it the end of the world. And I'm gon na have to be all like *relax fuck-tard*. When this calendar runs out we'll just start a new one. And they'll be like *well why don't you just make the next one now? * And I'll have to be all like *bitches do you know what we just did? We fucking made a calendar that'll last longer than you! * You think we'll get a thanks? No. Atan: "Shit. Let's go to the beach. We'll have time to make the next one when we come back." Acan: Yeah. Good idea. Want to sacrifice someone before we go? Atan: Yeah man. Acan:
