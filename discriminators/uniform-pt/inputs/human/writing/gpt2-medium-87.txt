 "Man, another one of these guys? How does this even happen?" Jack looks over at Ronny who's walking towards the phone on the wall behind the counter. Ronny responds, "I know right? Where the hell is Craig, and what's up with all these people screaming and crying saying that they're Craig? Craig has black pants, a red shirt, and a pair of bright pink shoes." A man in a red suit with black shoes is in the entrance of the diner yelling about being Craig. "Craig's got ta be pulling something. Didn't he get a bonus last month? Do you think that'd be enough to live off for this long and pay all these people?" Jack pulls his cellphone out of his pocket and starts dialing. "Maybe. Anyway, I'm going to call security before this guys head explodes." Ronny takes the diner phone and calls security. "I'll see if I can reach Craig this time. Who knows, maybe he isn't in on it and he'll get a kick out of this." Jack puts the phone to his ear as the security guard kicks open the security office door. "All right wheres the hoodlum." Says the security guard. "He's right there Po." Ronny responds. Po jumps at the mysterious red suited man and tackles him to the ground, knocking his phone out of his pocket to the floor. Po positions his arms around the hoodlums neck and strangles him to death. "That's enough of that" says Po as he heads back to his office. "It's ringing, let's see if he'll pick up" said Jack A few seconds later the phone on the ground begins to ring. Three words can be seen on the screen, "Jack is calling." Ronny looks at Jack in shock and says "How the hell did that guy get Craig's phone?!"
