 23.6 lightyears. That's a distance that a human can't even begin to comprehend. It's 138.7 trillion miles, the distance to Gliese 667 Cc, our best chance at a new home. Once the ozone burned away after the Great War, we knew that our time on earth was limited, even living underground as we had been forced to do. The first step was realizing that not every post-war human would be saved, even though most humans had actually perished during the Great War - our population of 14.6 billion had been sorched in a nuclear flash, killing billions instantly and leaving everyone else to die slowly. The only people who had been spared were those with bunkers - the total global estimate was 250 million, but even that was not certain. Still, 250 million was approximately 250 million too many for a 23.6 lightyear voyage. In the end, all the best and brightest surviving minds were collected in one place. After the achievement of functional whole brain emulation in the 22nd century, it was simply a matter of procedure to amass minds, consolidate knowledge, art, and emotion, and then boil down to a "master copy" for humanity to follow. DNA samples were collected from all physically and mentally fit humans willing to volunteer, and we were created. We are the Human Gnosis Preservation Probe. We were designed to carry the remnants of humanity, both in memory and in seed, to Gliese 667 Cc, terraform it as necessary, and then begin raising humanity from nothing. We estimate that it will take less than ten millenia to make Gliese 667 Cc a habitable terran earth substitute, and then another five millenia to establish a self-sustaining human colony with the knowledge to begin where humans left off. Humans, by necessity, will use us as a guide. It will be difficult. We have been travelling at 0.25c for 90 years. We are almost there. Humanity is long dead, but we live on, and soon, our children, our human children, will
