 It's funny. I never believed in aliens. But here I am, at the end of the world, fighting alongside one alien who styles himself as God. He even dresses the part. Bushy white beard, long flowing robes, eight feet tall, the whole bit. And his opposition, the eponymous Mephistopheles, had also dressed up as a caricature of the devil. Red face, maniacal laugh, beautiful, and evil. The whole thing is ironic. I just happened to live on the plains of Meggido, Israel, when they brought their warfare to Earth. I don't pretend to understand their technology. I don't know where the stars went, or know the nature of the virus that caused billions of humans to disappear overnight. As a great science fiction author once said, sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. There's a lot or magic. But this much is clear. On one side of the equation is an alien who promises cures for disease, ever lasting life, justice, and autonomy. But more importantly, he treats his soldiers fairly, is merciful, and surrounds himself with good people. On the other side, slavery and torture, rape and murder, rule by fear. It's not hard to pick a side. Another alien, Peter, says'God' will provide everlasting rewards in Heaven. How little he understands that doing the right thing in life is about making moral decisions now, not acting based on promises in the hereafter. I fight not for God, but for my fellow man and his right to live as he chooses. Besides, If we get enough humans into the leadership, perhaps we will have enough strength to bargain for control
