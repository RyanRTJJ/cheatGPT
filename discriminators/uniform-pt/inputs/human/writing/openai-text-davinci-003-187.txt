 PBG1980: It's been 3 years Mark I love you, but I can't do this anymore. We have to talk about it. MarkJ733: Stace, we've been over this 100 times. We met on a forum specifically for people who didn't want to talk about their powers. PBG1980: Things can't be any worse. Everyone hates me, life is miserable, the only thing I have is you. MarkJ733: We're the same. That's why we can't meet. At least this way we have something. PBG1980: We have to at least talk about our powers.... I know I was your safe space, but we have to do it. MarkJ733: Fine.... I've probably done this 1000 times in my head, let's hope I screw it up now. MarkJ733: My power controls everyone around me and it's not something I can turn off. Anyone I meet will do anything I want. When my powers first developed it was great. I could have any woman I wanted, fame, fortune, you know, the ideal life. And I did for a while, but in time I realized that owning a world of slaves isn't fun. I tried online dating, you know, make sure the girl actually likes me before we go out. That obviously didn't work out though. So 4 years ago I bought myself a nice mansion and haven't left it since. So now you see why we can't meet, I don't want you to become a slave. PBG1980: We should have talked about this a long time ago.... MarkJ733: I know, but I didn't want to lose my only friend. PBG1980: You don't understand. PBG stands for "Powers Be Gone"
