 Dear Mom: Today I think I saw the worst of humanity. Today may have been the day of the armistice, but I feel that there can never be peace, not after what I saw today. Captain Gooding had us go and leave the trench at 10:45 this morning. 15 minutes before the supposed armistice was to be signed. Gooding had always had a sort of blood lust against the Germans. I don't know why. He didn't even like me due to my last name among other things, saying I was a hyphenated american papist who probably wanted the "Krauts" to win. The sad thing was that today in order to prove him wrong I not only followed orders, I went above and beyond. I killed some poor German boy probably only 16 or so in the trench eating a late breakfast. I then went on to slaughter a bunch more a few feet away and kept going. I knew it wasn't worth anything. We were going to win the war. We were going to finish our goal. But why did we have to keep going when we'd passed the finish line? That's what sickened me. To me this was like kicking a mean old dog who already was inches from death. Yet because of folks like Gooding and those searching for vainglory we had to keep going. I mean we lost 5 men on this charge and why? Just so we could kick them in the teeth more? In
