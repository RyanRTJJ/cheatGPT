 [ From NASA perspective ] "Are you all watching this?" John, the top controller fresh out of college asked through the comm. The room was dark except for the mass of computer screens and the giant television in front of everyone in the communication pit. "Yes, John. I don't want to be though," Sally replied from the other side of the room. The screen had little flags where each child was labeled only by state and a number up to ten. The planet they'd been sent to had a structure roughly the size of a strip mall equip with all kinds of survival requirements and research tools. Every state trained their kids how to survive and it was beaten into their heads that survival and teamwork of the utmost importance. Apparently it hadn't stuck. The southern states, Alabama and the rest of the bible belt children, were aligning themselves against the north by splitting the strip mall structure in half. They were only talking to each other, and the girls had been taken over by the boys, turned into nothing more than pleasure slaves and cooks. The north had a wiser approach with an even distribution of tasks, including guard posts against the south, and relaxation stations. The only real issue here, beyond the fact that humanity was completely screwed with these kids leading it, was that the North had all the food. What a royal disgrace this experiment had turned out to be, and they'd only been there a week. Kids these days. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -End -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
