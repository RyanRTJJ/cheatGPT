 I'm a good person. You may not believe me, especially if you know me, but I swear. It's all just so confusing. I admit, I was stupid. I loved her, I really did, and I couldn't imagine losing her. It's why I kept her away, kept her from going out with other people. When I saw her with him I just got so angry, I don't know what came over me. I just didn't want him to touch her, to pollute her with his touch. Every moment I watched her sit with him just made me so mad until I couldn't control myself. I really thought that her best friend was coming on to me, if she had said "no" then I would have stopped. It's not my fault she regretted it in the morning, she really did want it at the time. I don't know why she got so mad about it, it's not even that big of a deal. It was just one time, and with her best friend. Not like I'm just hooking up with random girls I meet. I love her. I really do. Waking up to find her gone, to find all of her things missing.... it tore me up inside. Why did she leave? Couldn't she see how much I cared? That note she left.... she couldn't have left that. She wouldn't blame me for all of those things, like I said I couldn't - it's not my fault. I don't know who did this to her, who told her this stuff, who twisted her mind to make her leave (I'm sure it was against her will, we were perfect together), but I'll find them. I'l find them and get her back. We're perfect together, they'll see. I just have to show them. Show them and make sure this never happens again.
