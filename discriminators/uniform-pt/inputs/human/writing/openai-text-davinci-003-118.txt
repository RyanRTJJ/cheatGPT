 I don't know when it happened but she was was gone when I came through the closet door. The familiar slow breathing I have come to expect wasn't there. The blankets were flung into the corner. The rest of the house was silent. I knew instantly that something was wrong. I stalked my way down the hall and saw the front door ajar. NO! Throwing caution to the wind, I launched myself through the front door, tearing it into splinters as I passed. Standing in the yard I caught a whiff of her scent on the wind as it caressed my fur. West. She went west. I followed her trail for hours, hiding in the shadows of trees and alleys as I tracked her. I knew I was taking a huge risk by following her. If I was seen, then our secret existence would be exposed but it didn't matter. She was mine. MINE! Her scent got stronger. I was close. Then, my ears perked up. A whimpering cry. One so very familiar. Unforgettable. THERE in that house. I crept up to the window and peered in. Those weren't her parents. I felt rage building in my chest. A primordial anger. Never before had I need of my claws or fangs for harm. Fear was all I had ever used them for in the past, but not today. Today they tasted blood and pain. When it was done, I stood amidst the wreckage of my wrath.
