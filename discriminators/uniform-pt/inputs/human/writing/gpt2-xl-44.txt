 The smell is the first thing that hits you. From a distance the bus stop looks okay. Run down and dingy like every other bus stop, but then you hit a wall of smell. It's like rotten cabbage mixed with swamp gas, Ax Body Spray and Taco Bell hot sauce. If you can make it through the wall of smell then what you thought was a dingy run down bus stop turns into an assault on the eyes. What looked like paint from a distance is mildew. It glops and slides down the walls. If you stand under the cover it will occasionally fall down with a wet plop onto ground. Heaven forbid you are standing under it after it falls. When the wind is blowing in your direction you can taste it. It's probably the spores from the mold that cakes the joints. A dusty cakey feeling will coat your tongue. It's like chalk mixed with finger paint. Even a five year old would hesitate to eat it. When you've made it this far don't touch it. A man touched it once. Within minutes he broke out in a rash. A few minutes after that he had pustules weeping from the rash site. He called an ambulance and patiently waited. By the time the EMTs got to him he was a crying, pus weeping, curled up mess on the sidewalks. An entire wing of the hospital closed down to prevent the spread of whatever he had. One would think that no one would use this bus stop. Most would be correct. The bus stop often isn't used for catching a bus. Homeless people use it as a shield to masterbate or have sex with each other. Teens use it to smoke behind or have beers. The sounds of their laughing and moaning filters through the layers of the bus stop and haunt anyone who happens to be standing there. The bus stop does something to the sounds. It perverts them. It twists them into an unnatural thing that will pick its way into your brain. Like an earwig
