 Boj woke up to a shooting pain in his arm. Fearing a heart attack he ran to the bathroom for aspirin but slipped on the loose hallway rug. The fall broke his arm. Crawling in pain, he made it to the living room where the phone was. Grabbing for the phone he knocked over his water glass from the night before. The glass teetered on the coffee table before falling onto Boj's head, striking him in the left eye.

Again he crawled across the room and across the broken glass from the coffee table. Many cuts and much bleeding ensued. When he reached the spot where the phone lay Boj no longer knew if he had the strength to dial 9-1-1. He lay down and began to pray. "Please God, give me the ability to make this call."
