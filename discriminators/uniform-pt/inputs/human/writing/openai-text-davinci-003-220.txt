 Today is January first, 1866. Europe has been ravaged by wars, but Denmark and Rome have persevered. Now, for the first time in centuries, the Norse and the Romans have come to peace. Tonight we will toast to our brotherhood. Ten years ago, on Yuletide's eve, I awoke in the newly conquered city of Barcelona. I had no idea what was going on. I spoke neither Norse nor Spanish, and was, quite frankly, terrified. But I caught on quickly. The viking tongues aren't so different from English, and within a month I could speak Danish fluently. I was incorporated into a Berzerker squad, and with them I got to see the world. I fought rebels in Athens, and I raided the Gaulish countryside. All things considered, nothing compared to the Eastward Guard in Finland. There were thousands of barbarian tribes out there, all hell-bent on killing us. I was trained for a ski-infantry regime in Oslo, and sent East for the winter. Three months. In that time the enemy started calling me "Bluetooth" for my outdated uniform. I returned a hero. You all know this. The people named me Jarl of Stockholm. After two years I became High King, a title I thank you for. It's been a wild ride. For that, I am eternally thankful. Caesar Constantine, I thank you for coming here, and your support in the coming war with the Shoshone. Now, let the feasting BEGIN! -- -- - I haven't written anything in a while, and this is on my kindle. Sorry for any errors.
