 James Vance relived those final moments over and over again in his mind. The split second where he tried to veer out of the way. That feeling of dread as he felt the tires begin to spin out on the rain slicked pavement. That moment where the headlights of the semi flashed across his windshield, flooding his Honda with light. That final second where he looked to Vicky, to see that look of true fear. Vicky had been thrown from the car as the semi plowed into the passenger side, and he was trapped in the twisted metal husk that was his car, his body crushed. He was forced to watch as Vicky lay lifelessly on the asphalt. Her body looked twisted and broken. A pretty thing made ugly by cruel fate. His final moments spent watching the product of his choices. The choices that cost his wife her life. There was nothing to remember after that, only the voice that spoke to him from beyond. From that place of dreaming. “ *This is your death James. I am here to offer you respite. Life will be yours once more, but not without suffering. Choose now, before leaving this dream. * ” In front of him stood three stone angels, each carved to hold a different burden. One of blood, one of sweat, and one of tears. He walked forward, to hold the hand of the angel of tears. The voice spoke to him again.
