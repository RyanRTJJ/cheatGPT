 "Life is full of twists and turns. I still remember my first time taking away someone's life. Thinking back now, it is funny how life forces you to become something you never want to be. I guess I just have to embrace it right?" The night was illuminated by two shadows huddling close by a fire. "Where was I? Right, my first kill. I was 8 when I found it by accident. My mom was never a good cook; she was awful in fact. Can't even make a god damn peanut butter jelly sandwich right. But I still remember her standing there by the kitchen counter, looking at me - that warm smile, the awkwardly placed dimples near her chins, and her eyes squinting a little. She would always bring that warm cup of beef flavor noodles to me, rest her lips on my forehead and give me the longest kiss. Then she'd lightly tap my nose and tell me "Be careful sweetie, it's hot." and go on to prepare hers. It's all history from that point forward. Got capture and put into this bloody game." I gazed intently at Caitlyn. She stared at my blank, hollow eyes. Hands clutched close to her throat and white smoke rises from her mouth, as she is try to make out her last words. Her sharp nails bloody as she claws at her reddened throat choking at what seems to be her last meal. "This is the only way I could feel and see my mom again." Rolling on the round, struggling, red faced, choking, helplessly extending arms forward, begging for mercy, gasping for her last breath.
