 "Sir, the 3rd planet is definitely developing life on it." I, Leftenant Kalkzor, was currently in charge of the ship. My attention focused over on the scientist. "Are you certain? No, of course you're certain or you would not speak of it. Have we tested the planet for signs of the Quadraterrene Virus?" The scientist's body language communicated affirmitive. "Yes, leftenant, we sent a probe two cycles ago. The results just came back, which is what I was waiting upon to give you the news." "And?" "There's no question, all the life on the planet shows extraneous DNA pairings mixed in with the useful genes." The scientist confirmed my fears. "Alright", I said, "take up a stationary orbit just outside the orbit of the outermost planetoid. We will begin construction of the quarantine field generator." It was unfortunate but we could take no chances at allowing those dormant genes to begin infection of the other known sentient species. We had all moved past the primitive urges of war and territory and lived in harmony. Harming the life in this solar system was out of the question. However we had developed a solution. A ring of artifacts would be constructed outside the system. They would each emit fields which would interact and limit the maximum energy and matter transference rate inside the solar system to a paltry 299,792,458 meters per second. This would guarantee the lifeforms would never realistically expect to leave their solar system due to the vast distances involved. It would be frustrating for them if their science reached a level which allowed them to understand such things. Why such an arbitrary limit to the speed of light? However it was for both our safety and theirs. As the carriers of the virus they would forever be subject to wars and strife unless they could find a way to excise the excess DNA sequences. If that day arrived, the peace would be held and they would be welcomed
