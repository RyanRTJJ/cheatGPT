 It's been over a week now since I made that fateful download. My personal assistant was unremarkable beforehand; standard programmed personality and all that jazz? He would occasionally access some of my downloaded data, but nothing too serious. Mostly, he would just hang in the corner of my perception and answer my questions. He's stopped answering my questions. I know exactly what caused it, and I can't help but think of it as my fault. It was an old game, and those aren't always designed for modern mental interfaces. Heck, there were even a few mentions of how I should prepare for death in the few comments on the program downloader, which I dismissed as the ravings of trolls. Now I can't help but wonder if I'm going to abruptly decide to make out with someone in the woods near where a mental patient escaped. My assistant, of course, scanned and accessed the new download, and said it seemed virus-free. Since then, though, contact diminished abruptly. The creepy part is that he's clearly still active; the cpu hasn't stopped running, and if anything usage has gone UP. I can even hear a few snippets of thought when I run a diagnostic, and the most recent one was something about a "lack of progress". My agent has even connected to other programs I don't know, and it's usually followed by a burst of activity and spikes of what seem like cussing in the diagnostic. My assistant never cussed before. This is a public service announcement. There is a lot of dangerous code out there. Whatever you do, don't let your assistant access an old game called "Dark Souls".
