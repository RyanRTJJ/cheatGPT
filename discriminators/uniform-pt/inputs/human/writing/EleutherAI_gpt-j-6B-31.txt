 It was loud. Like, really loud. I'd never shot a gun before. I'd watched a ton of action movies and they did it with such ease that figured it couldn't be that hard. My ears were ringing so hard that I had dropped the gun. I closed my eyes out of sheer pain and covered my ears. I could feel the vibrations reverberating through my forearm. It was uncomfortable but nowhere near as rough as what I was feeling in my ear drums. I thought back to why I was standing here firing this gun in the first place. Years and years of torture and torment were making me feel like the scum of the Earth. I wasn't sure what I had done wrong, only that he made me feel like I was nothing. It is a really shitty feeling if you didn't know. Through everything I'd experienced and seen via movies and TV and the books I've read I couldn't really relate. Then again they say "you don't know until you've tried." Well that's what got me here.... Standing in a very dark pool of blood with tingling fingers and temporary deafness. They say no one will remember once you revert. I'd often pondered what had happened to me in the seemingly infinite number of timelines that existed. How many people that I've upset have killed me or at the very least attempted to punch me. And to that point I wonder how many people revert when they're on the receiving end of a beat down.... I looked down at the bloodied corpse below me and felt a wave of happiness, something I hadn't felt in a long time. Shortly after, though, I feel the regret start to settle in followed by the return of my hearing. Lucky for me though I am able to go back and right this horrendous wrong. After all, this homeless person didn't deserve to die. But now I know how loud a gun is.
