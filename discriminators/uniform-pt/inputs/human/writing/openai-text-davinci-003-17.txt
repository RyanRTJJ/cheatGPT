 The blade hurt every time. Some people went by pills, some by accident, some were forced, and some just waited until they woke up young again. I've taken the blade 6 times now. Each time I sit on my bed knowing it will hurt, but knowing the other side will be so much better. 97 years ago I made the worst decision of my life. I chose falling in love to be my kryptonite. I thought I was playing the system, tricking it with some lawyer crap thinking that love didn't exist. Jess had just phoned when the technician asked me. I was sitting in that blasted white chair clenching the cell phone. Teeth tight together I pushed out one word. "Love" I'd said. The technician asked me if I understood what I was saying. I did. I had thought I loved her. In those two minutes between walking down the hall and sitting in the chair and being asked I decided I didn't love her anymore, but that I had once. But I knew one day She would be out there and I didn't want to die until I met Her. So I said "Love, I don't want to die until I've truly loved." The technician's thumb pushed down on that red button, as an incomprehensible whisper escaped his lips. I use the blade after every serious relationship. It reminds me of why I made my choice, gives me a fresh start so that when I find Her we get our whole lives to spend together. This time, after I woke up at 18, I remembered that little whisper of the technician. I don't know why it came back this time. "The gift of Immortality." -- Its a little typoed and
