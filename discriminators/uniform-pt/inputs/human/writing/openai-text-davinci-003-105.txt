 I woke up at 2:00 in the morning in my old bunk-bed which I didn't actually share with anybody. I was too tired to realize this, however, so I tried to swing myself out of bed, but to no prevail because my feet just hit the railing. Confused, I looked at my surroundings a bit more, and saw my old stuff. My monster truck poster. My TV that always played "~~Mickey's~~ House of ~~Mouse~~ Villains". I whispered aloud, "But I moved from this place years ago!" I climbed down my bunk bed, and made my way to the bathroom, just to see my 5 year old body. I went to where the dining room was to see that drawing thing I had that hooked to the TV. I also saw Fairly Odd Parents themed birthday decorations. "Holy shit, this is my 5th birthday," I said to myself. I went downstairs to listen to music on the computer, but none of my music really.... existed. Apparently 2008 was a lame time for music. I finally found something I liked, but it just sounded like noise. Just then, I realized I was in my parent's room and they were wide awake from my music. My mom asked, "What the hell are you doing?" "Ay mom, it's my birthday. Give me a break," I said. "How are you talking so maturely all of a sudden?" "How did I end up here? I'm 13! And I'm in my five year old body! How is this happening?" "Wha..?" Apparently my mom had no idea what was going on. Since I was only 5, I swore to myself to survive this 8 years. I swore to be less cringy with the stuff I make. Besides, this was an entire 8 years I got to do over! I know exactly what's in store
