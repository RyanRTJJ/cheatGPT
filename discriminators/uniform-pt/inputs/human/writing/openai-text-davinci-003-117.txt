 "Come my children. Come and listen to a tale of old. A tale of destruction at the beginning of our time." They came in moving mountains set ablaze. Falling from the skies, creating a blanket of black ash in their wake. The first touch of their behemoths onto our land was a kiss of death. Whole tribes were extinguished when their mountains fused with the soil, crushing them in scorching fire. We cried out in anguish at the loss of connection. 100,000 Scrahn blinked out of existence in a single, terrifying moment of confusion. That wasn't the end. The mountains started shaking and changing. Tentacles reached out and stabbed the earth with malicious intent. Only evil spirits could explain the unnatural motions. Beams of the sun also pierced our land from the heavens. To approach them meant only death. A *Great Marhyrm King*, a being of power and strength would shrink from the site. Then all was still for 4 moon passings. Then *it* came out of a opening. A pet behemoth.
