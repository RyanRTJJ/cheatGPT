 I can vividly remember the moment my doctor told my parents I was mentally challenged. It was in the 1st grade. Had I not raised my hand in class and asked the teacher to repeat a concept we learned last week, perhaps my illness would have been hidden longer. Ever since then, I was enrolled in'special education' along with other students with developmental disabilities. Although I am cursed with forgetfulness, the memories of being called a'retard' while walking home from school will forever be seared into my mind. & nbsp; People often ask me how I am able to function in society when I can not process basic information like everyone else. Honestly, I can not. I bounce between odd jobs, because eventually the employer's realize that I don't personally greet returning customer's, and often time's don't even remember their names. At this point, almost everyone I've interacted with has grown bored of me. You see, the beauty of photographic memory is that you can receive and retain information instantaneously. When interacting with others, the conversations move too fast and span several topics which I have no mastery of. I have become a burden to everyone I interact with, even my parents. My mother helped me immensely with my daily-life. Perhaps the minutest details of *two* lives were too much. She passed about three or four weeks ago, the exact date escapes me. & nbsp; So if you are reading this, it means that I have gone to a place where none of our memories matter. My only wish was that I could remember my mother's face, I would be content even if there was even one photo of her. But obviously, photos are for idiots who can't remember. For retards. I simply couldn't continue. I just.... I just
