 "You've finally done it, master. Unquestioned world domination. The planet is entirely under your control." Wallace (aka Dr. Doom) turned toward the window and looked down upon his slaves. He clasped his hands behind his back as he let out a long *hmmmmmmmm. * The truth that Wallace would not admit was that he had no idea what he would do with his newfound powers. He had spent all of his villainy planning for this moment, though he had never once thought of what he would do with it. There were vague ideas of forcing people to do terrible things and watching with barely-masked glee as people bent to his every whim. *What* exactly those terrible things were, Wallace didn't have the faintest idea. "As my first act of World Domination," Wallace paused before continuing, "I will outlaw the color blue." Igor made a sound in the back of his throat. "Master, I do not mean to intrude on your evil plans, but might I remind you that your evil suit is blue?" "Damn," Wallace spat. "The color green. And red. And strawberries. And cheese." Igor made another little sound as he whimpered, "Cheese, master?" "Not for you and I, Igor. Just for those below. We shall outlaw cheese and I will fill the televisions with advertisements of it. I will write opinion pieces for all the major newspapers about the deliciousness of cheese. And no one will ever eat it again. Especially in France. No more cheese in France." "Excellent, master," Igor was taking notes.
