 Just got the news? Me too. Don't really know what we are supposed to do? You think it's a hoax? How could NASA confirm the existence of God? I guess if the smartest scientists from around the globe, presumably all atheists, were able to confirm the existence of God then people like me are screwed. Yeah, that was me. Sitting on my couch watching TV, as I did every night. I never had time for religion. I was always too busy doing something else. Something *real*. Well, guess this is just another mistake to add to the list. Because apparently now the existence of God has been proven. Without a doubt. Why didn't I go to church more? Why didn't I pray? Was it really that much work to thank Him for my meals? Was it so hard to give Him my thanks when I did well? My selfish mind thought those things were all created by me, my peers, and things I could see. Tangible things. But now I find out I was wrong. That was the internal struggle I had going on. Rationalizations, memories, excuses. Also, who had the time to read, especially such long stories? I wasn't a good reader, and frankly didn't want to improve. I had TV, and that's all I needed. I remembered that I was baptized, so maybe that would appease God. I'd also been to Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve a few times, so I was no stranger to His house. Maybe he would still accept me? Would that be enough? But you know, with all those thoughts, there's been one thing at the front of my mind since the broadcast. Haunted me, even. They never said which God they found.
