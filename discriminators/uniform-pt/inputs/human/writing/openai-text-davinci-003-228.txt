 1955, Hill Valley. A strange blue box materialized out if thin air in front of Doc Brown's house with a wheeze. A man steps out wearing reading glasses and a blue suit. His brown hair was done up with a slight curl at the top. Looking around he smiled to himself and made his way to the door of the house and knocked on the door. Doc Brown answered the door and looked at the man. The man showed him a peice of paper and said "I am with the FBI, I am here to inspect anything that is out if the ordinary." Doc looked at the man confused and said: "Well, Mr FBI, if you are who you say you are, where is your badge?" The man smiled and said "Oh, you are a clever one arn't you. I am the Doctor." "Doctor, who?" asked Doc Brown. The Doctor did not answer, instead he invited himself inside and looked around. "Well, this is not what I expected, no De Lorian, no Flux capacitor, have you tried your mind reading invention?" "De Lorian? Flux capacitor? Great Scott, man, what are you talking about? Why are you in my house?!" "Oh, no reason," replied the Doctor as he picked up a small trinket from the fire place. "Just don't get to see too many time travellers, let alone a human time traveller." "Time traveler?" "Yes, time traveler. Oh, I believe this would be yours." The Doctor reached into his jacket and produced a rough draft of the Flux Capacitor. "Great Scott! Is that a device used to-" "Yes it is. However I must warn you not to change the past."
