 It was happening again. My power, my life force, it was draining from me. He'd moved too far away, and he'd taken that part of me with him. I reached towards my phone, but my vision was blurring and it was hard to move. I accidentally knocked it to the ground, so I fell down to get it. Moving was so hard. He's the first contact in my phone, just for situations like this. It doesn't happen often, but once is enough to kill me. "The fuck do you want?" He's pissed off, surprise surprise. He can't handle the amount of power he took from me. "I swear to god, Raiko, if this is something stupid again-" He could go on for ages. "Hikaru, shut up and come back home. You're too far! Our connection snapped and I'm barely holding on." I was grasping for even a thread of power, just the tiniest bit would've gotten me through. "Ah, shit." Hikaru was home in an instant (teleportation is a handy thing), but I barely noticed him. The only important thing was my power flowing back inside me. I was feeling whole again, and slowly recovering my vision and movement. My power and life force were back. I looked over at Hikaru and saw him visibly calming down. "Sorry for shouting," he mumbled, avoiding eye contact. "Nah," I sighed. "I know you have a hard time with all that raw power. You should apologize to whoever you were with, instead." It was stupid, I knew he was with his girlfriend. Why did I always avoid her name? Hikaru didn't answer, but instead helped me up and onto the couch, where he sat and put my head in his lap. "I'll stay here with you until you recover." It was happening again. My face was burning and it was all I could do to keep from crying. Every time he chose me over her, I was falling in love all over again.
