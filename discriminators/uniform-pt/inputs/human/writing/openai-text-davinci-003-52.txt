I'm rushed over to the scene by an officer. "There's only five minutes left!" Screams out the officer in charge. I can see the panic written all over his face. He wasn't prepared for this, none of them were. Not even te bomb squad, hell even I wasn't. The closer I got the louder the ticking was.

Pull some wires out or something. I'll try that again. The remaining time on the timer is now half of what it was.
