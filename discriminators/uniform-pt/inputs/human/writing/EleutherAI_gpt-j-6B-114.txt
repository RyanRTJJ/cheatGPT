 "My name is Allan Lewinsky. For ten years, I've been broadcasting from the St. Louis radio antenna, located right off of Brown Street. I'd begin everyone of my daily broadcasts the same way,'Good Morning and welcome to the final station, the last hope for all those who might remain out there.' But sadly the final station is broadcasting for the final time. For ten years, I've made this broadcasting station my home. I built a guest room.... for anyone that wished to have it. I always had spare rations on the off chance somebody showed up, but nobody did and I don't have those rations anymore. For ten years I'd ask anybody remaining to come to the broadcasting station or just give me a sign that I'm not the last one alive. Nobody has done that in the ten years of this station. I promise you, if there is anyone there, that all I wanted was to know you. I wanted to know that I wasn't going to be the one to see the final sunset, the one to say the final word.... I didn't want to have the last laugh, never did. I just wanted to know you. I've waited ten years for you and I've never been able to even say hello or get your name. My name is Allan Lewinsky, I was born in this city and I lived in it for my entire life. I married a beautiful woman.... her name was Elise. She died along with the others the first day. Today I turn sixty-three and I don't care. What are celebrations if nobody else is there to celebrate with. My name is Allan Lewinsky. Today there is a slight chance of rain. I am the last human alive, I saw the final sunset, said the last word, and had the.... last laugh. Thank you, and goodnight."
