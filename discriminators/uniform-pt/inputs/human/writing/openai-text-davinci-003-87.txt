 Edit: just noticed it specifies "teenager". Ooooops. Hi! My name is Suzy. I'm only three years old, but I'm very smart! I'm already learning my shapes and colors, and I can even count a little too. I like counting. I see numbers a lot. 1s, 2s, 3s..... 4 and 5 seems a little less common, but I do see them sometimes. Like last week when I tripped over my shoe lace and scuffed my jeans. I didn't mean to fall, but mommy yelled really loud and I accidentally fell again. I think Mommy was trying to help me up, but she kept pulling just a little too hard. That's when I saw the 4s and finally a 5, before mommy sent me to my room. I don't know what those silly numbers were doing there, but it seems they've been appearing more often.... that is, ever since daddy came home from work with some lipstick on his shirt. Silly daddy! Lip stick is for girls! I miss my Daddy. I haven't seen him in, umm..... 1, 2, 3, 4 days! Not since he and mommy had their big fight. That's when I saw another number on mommy. It was a 1 with a circle next to it. I've never seen mommy that upset with daddy. It was really scary. I hope daddy comes home soon. Mommy hasn't been feeling very well. She's been sleeping a lot. I haven't been sleeping very well myself. I'm really hungry too. I tried to make my self some food earlier, but I accidentally spilled the milk carton all over the kitchen floor. Mommy got really upset when she came home. I saw the 1 with the circle next
