 I feel a crash. My room is thrown. Up, ^up, ^^up. I hear moans. Sirens. Yelling. It's overwhelming. I used to feel a steady beat in the darkness I inhabit. Where has it gone? It's gentle *b-bmp*. I have trouble sleeping. I kick. My world starts to fade. *HELP! * I think.^*Can't* ^*anyone* ^*hear* ^*me? * A knife pierces the womb, narrowly missing my foot. *emergency caesaerean* I hear. I hear crying. A man's. Where's my mother? Gloved hands. Rough but gentle. Get me out of here. I lived inside a body? Why is it dead? Where is my mother? I'm put into a warm room. The warm room is clear. Who is this man looking in at me? He says something. *" Is my daughter going to be okay? "* another voice, a woman, says, *" The chances are slim. We're doing all we can. "* *Am I going to die? * I fall into a deep sleep until I'm startled awake by a man. *Is this my dad? * ***WHERE IS MY MOTHER? *** I left the warm, clear room. I am strapped into a holding compartment. It vibrates and we are moving forward. The nice man is in the room with me. He's crying. Did something happen to my mommy? He makes some noise. Later when I am put into a soft wooden cage, he picks me up, still crying. *does this man always cry? * He says something.
