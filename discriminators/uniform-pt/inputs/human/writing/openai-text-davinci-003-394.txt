 Sometimes I don't think I'm like them. It's like we're too different. I wonder if they wait like I do. Under their stair somewhere, watching those flappy things, having a sniff, just, waiting like me.... The small one is good, he likes to play with me. But even then, some of the things are demeaning. I liked getting the food at first, it was a good trade. But after a while they stopped giving me food and still expected me to *perform*. But the little one is good, he sits with me and pats me. He's soft too. Not rough like the big one. He's bad sometimes. He hits me with that weird rolled up stick thing that's actually flat. It makes me so angry. I just yell! But then we cuddle when we're both tired. And the lady one! She's nice. She *smells* nice too. My *behind* flutters at her scent. I don't know why I wait. I used to wait with the other one, who was like me. We'd wait together, eat together, run together, and play. But then he went somewhere with them. I guess he waited long enough. They all had water leak down their face that time he went with them. I can't do that though. It looked refreshing. I get so hot sometimes. Just covered in all this hair. Unlike them. I only get a haircut in the hot times. They seemed to always be hairless! Except for the funny spot on top of their heads!
