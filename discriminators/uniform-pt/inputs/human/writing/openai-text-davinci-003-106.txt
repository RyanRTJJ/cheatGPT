 This is private Santiago's log. March 25th, 2102 The ship just came out of FTL. I can see other ships from the task force through the window. We are just jarheads, we are not given the details, but the sarge said there's at least 20.000 ships joining us. Who would have though that just twenty years after those bloated squid like floating weirdos gave us FTL drives in exchange for protection from the Ho' aram we would get a fleet that numbers more than 6 million ships! Mom, I wish you could see this. Battleships are dropping out of FTL like fireflies just before my eyes. Some fireflies!!! The "Devine vengeance" that I'm aboard is 11 miles long and it's not even amongst our largest ships. Mom, I actually saw the Titan before we launched, it's literally half the size of the USA! Some folks here saw her taking out the Ho' aram homeworld. If I am lucky I may see her take out the last two colonies in this sector. Mind you, the war gon na be over soon. Sarge said they only have half a dozen small colonies left now. Kinda feel sorry for them. I guess they bit off more than they could chew huh? We got some scientists aboard now. Keep telling us not to kill all of them and save some of their eggs for "species preservation" or somewhat. Don't know anything about that. Seems to me
