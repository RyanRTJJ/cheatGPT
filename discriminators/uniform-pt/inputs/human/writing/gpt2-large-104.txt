 I wonder if my hair is getting as shaggy as they tell me. I haven't looked in a mirror in a while. I couldn't stand seeing that number anymore. Constant glowing reminder that I'm getting closer and closer to death. Last time I checked I was Twenty-Two; at least that's what they call me. I kind of miss having sick days. I miss alot of things. It's weird knowing you can never pull a sick day in work again. I miss work. I spend alot more time at home than I used to. Once I got into the 50's they moved me into a really nice part of town. Great view of the lake and everything. Now I'm in the top 25 they've become really relaxed towards me now. I can't remember the last time I paid for something. I still carry my wallet around. Force of habit more than anything else. I say I probably have 3 months left at best. Once my number is up.... well no lives forever right? I think I might steal a car today. I saw one near the bank not too long ago the looked really nice. Really slick sports car. Might see if it's still there and try to take a trip to the mountains for the day. The city looks dirty under the sunset. Especially from this angle. I can almost make out some peoples numbers from here. Every couple of days, some poor sob like me gets executed just so we can contain our numbers. Not that they don't make the last few weeks comfortable. I'd almost jump if it weren't for the fact I'd be shortening other lives. That and I hear someone in the tens got
