 As I stood outside the Starbucks I watched a young girl who appeared to be no older than 18 sipping a coffee, I knew I had finally found her, the other immortal. I was positive it was her, I could feel an energy radiating from her unlike anything I had never felt before. I stood there contemplating what to do next I couldn't help but wonder if she could sense my presence as well. She seemed so happy just sitting there enjoying her coffee, she hadn't been immortal very long, she was still a kid in my eyes. As I thought about it I couldn't take her life, I've outlived her by so many lifetimes, I've traveled the world and visited every continent so many times that I can't count, I've had 5 families in my time and I've outlived them all I've got to do what mortals dream of, I've experienced true happiness. I couldn't take this poor girls life, but according to the prophecy one of us have to die by the end of 2017 or the apocalypse happens and everyone dies. I decided to approach her and let her take my life, to give her a chance to experience the happiness that I've gotten to experience. As I walked in to talk to her and tell her my plan to give up my life, for the greater good she gets up out of her chair and starts to approach me. As she stands in front of me before I could even say hello I have a cold blade in my side and I'm falling to the floor and everything is fading to black, the last thing I see and hear as the young girl leans into my ear is her saying "I got you before you could get me you son of a bitch."
