 "Hey dad?" I looked closely at my newly formed gash and how there were... Sparks? Coming out of it. "Why are there sparks dad? There's not supposed to be sparks!" I watch my dad run in and hold my arm and he reaches for my waist, I wake up in a factory with a mechanic by my side "where is my dad?" I ask as innocently as possible. "You'll be ready soon just go back to sleep and be more careful next time kid." I didn't know how to respond to the mechanic other than to go back to sleep. I wake up again but I hear more talking so I don't open my eyes "will he make it?" My dad asks "maybe but it completely destroyed its entire right arm and we don't have a spare..." I then hear my dad cry, for the first time in my life or whatever I have I heard my dad cry. I open my eyes to feel my dad hugging me as I let some tears out though I know they aren't real like my father's tears are. All I hear after he lets go is "shut em' down" with even more sadness. I open my eyes and try to say I'm fine but everything turned green all of a sudden. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Hopefully you guys liked this story I thought up. I did read some of these and thought about some of the things said but I tried as best as possible not to copy them. If you want more
