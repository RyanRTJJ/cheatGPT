 Steve Rogers was sitting on his rocking chair just outside his house. The sun was bright but not too warm, especially with the light breeze. He enjoyed the neighborhood. It was quiet, safe, and friendly. Well most of it anyways. A trio of prepubescent young boys quickly descended upon his green lawn, riding their department store-quality bikes, helmetless. *Ugh, the youth these days. Back when I was a kid, you would always wear a helmet, even if it was a trash lid. Got to stay safe. * The tween boys eyed the aged Rogers up, snickering. The leader of the rabble-rousers, a freckle-faced boy with a pig's snout for a nose and a messy clump of red hair, approached the retired avenger, bike in hand. "Fuck you Mr Rogers!" The hooligan quickly mounted his flame-painted speedster and took off with his posse, laughing and snorting at his victorious insult toward the elderly. Steve sighed and made chase. He quickly caught up to the gang, knocking a kid off his bike. He then ripped the other boy's bike out from under him, sending the boy tumbling to a week's worth of road rash. He then picked up the bike and threw it to the redheaded ne'er do well, launching the boy into the air and landing with a *smack! * on the pavement. The sniffling kid looked at the approaching Mr Rogers, face redder than his nemesis Red Skull's. The boy prepared for a beating and closed his eyes. Mr Rogers stared him down, fuming. Finally he picked up the kid by the collar and told him, "Language."
