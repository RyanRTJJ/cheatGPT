 Faking someone's death has never been easy, but in the era of constant video surveillance and digital personhood, it's never been harder. The plan had seemed flawless. Most plans seem that way before they are put into action. There were reasons, of course. Debt. Enemies. The appeal of a new start. Drew hadn't been entirely comfortable with any of them, but he loved Emily enough to do anything to stay with her. She'd made it pretty clear that she was going to do this and he could either help her or mourn her death with everyone else. It was a simple plan, really. Most good plans were. Suicide on a cruise ship. A public death with no body. The weighted body would hit the water before anyone could tell it was a dummy. That's exactly what happened. Drew turned on the waterworks. Smoked a cigarette. Went through some of the early steps of grief. People don't look too critically at how someone who lost a loved one grieves. Emily's part was to hide for the remainder of the voyage, sneak off the boat and disappear. That was the plan. But a camera had captured the moments before the staged death, and that from just that angle, it didn't look like Emily had jumped at all. It looked like she had been pushed. Because the dummy had been pushed. And so when Drew was arrested and detained in the ships brig by the cruise security to be turned over to law enforcement at the next port, Emily was still alive. But when they ship weighed anchor and Drew was finally transferred, she was dead.
