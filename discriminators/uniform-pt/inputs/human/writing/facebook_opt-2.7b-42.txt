 **Warning: Half Life fanfiction ahead** They say Gordon Freeman doesn't talk. And they're mostly right. I don't talk. Not to them, anyway, and not since the Incident. I have no idea why they insist on calling it an Incident. That makes it sound like someone, I dunno, miswired the coolant system and one of the tanks blew, not like they supercharged a giant quantum physics manipulation machine and the entire space-time continuum blew. More than that, though, I also have no idea why everyone insists on calling ME either the hero of the day or the devil incarnate. All I did was push a button and move a cart, and then not get killed. And then I disappeared for twenty years. A fat lot of good I've been doing humanity this whole time. But that's not the point either.

I felt there was an inherent goodness in all life and given a chance it could manifest itself. I was what you might call a bleeding-heart. Then I beat my first headcrab to death with my crowbar and saw Carl get headraped by another one, and my heart began to bleed out. By the time I had finished defending/escaping from Black Mesa, there was no blood left. Only ice. You have one chance, I'll tell you now. One chance to prove to me that you're on my side. You blow it, this is my world, and my world has no use for you. I am not proud of the ruthless machine I've become, and I wish I didn't have to be it. But my enemy was the one who flipped the switch, and until every last one of them is gone from this
