 They had just gone upwards and planted the trees along the way. Some of the shorter buildings still had smaller trees on top, their roots wrapping around and into the buildings.

There they had to wear smog masks and carry oxygen tanks or scrubbers with them. No, Tokyo had become the land of greenery to all who seek such things. Entire buildings were sometimes overtaken by the plants and trees that would grow from lower levels or grow downwards. It was also good reasoning for the riverways.
