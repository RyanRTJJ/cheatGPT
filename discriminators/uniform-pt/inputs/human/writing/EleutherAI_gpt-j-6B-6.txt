 Ive never been very popular. Ever since I was born I've been different than everyone around me. And by that I mean I can control time. And no it's not something cool like mind powers or a vintage car, no, I control time by walking. Not very impressive or mystic is it? It only gets worse from here. I've gone by many names in my travels through human history, but in my native English they call me The Crab. Yep you guessed it, to stay in the current time I have to walk sideways, scuttling along like a crab. Now before you go off accusing my of being ungrateful for this "gift" think about it for a second, what if you could only walk sideways your whole life? Would the wonders of the world really be that great of a consolation for being ostracized from everyone in the world? Sure I've seen pretty temples and the wonders of the future but is it all worth it? No. I just want to be normal. Every time I go back to my home people constantly try to convince me to walk forward like a normal person. My parents are the only ones that "believe" in the lie I told them about my legs being horribly disfigured in an accident or something and the only way I can stop the pain is by walking sideways. I've been to countless doctors visits and they all say that there's nothing wrong with my legs at all. Sometimes I still go just for the hell of it, it's oddly comforting to me. The last time I went the doctor suggested something different other than to just try walking: he told me to use a wheelchair. Yeah. I know. "How didn't you think of using a wheelchair for all those years?" I don't want to hear it.
