 Sportsmen and women love to challenge themselves. I can't think of a single one that I've met who didn't have that perfect goal. That borderline moment of perfection that they strive for. A 300 yard drive in golf, a perfect game in baseball, the bowlers hat-trick in cricket, the goalkeepers clean sheet, the flawless Hail Mary and the list goes on. While I don't class myself as a sportsman I suppose what I do is a sport. I'm not bad at it, that's for sure, because you can't be good at it. You've got to be lucky and I'm nothing but the opposite. This event that I chose as my Moby Dick happens once a year. ONCE. There's no training for it and there's no gold medal for winning it. I've been going for four years and every single year I've broken a bone competing. Both arms and both legs. One a year for four years. I've got a reputation for it. People give me space when we're out on the grass. This year though. This year I've got that feeling. I'm going to stand at the top and work my way to the bottom and I'm going to be the first one there. This year is my year. This is the year where I stand at the top of Robinswood Hill and wait for the starters orders. There's no gun or clapper. Just a man with a wheel of Double Gloucester. He's going to let it go and me and countless other men are going to chase it down a God-knows-how-steep hill. You catch that cheese or you're the first one to the bottom after it and you win. You win
