 "But I want one!" she shouted, clumsy fingers tearing at her now crinkled dress. The young girl stomped through her room, grunting and puffing in agitation to show her father just how angry she was. "My dear daughter, those creatures are incredibly dangerous," the king pleaded. "It would take many knights to roam the land in search of a matriarch." "I don't care!" screeched the princess, causing her father to wince. "I will be the queen someday! I have to emanate power and grace! And am I not already graceful, father?!" He patted his forehead with a small cloth and nodded eagerly. "Of course, love, of course." The princess sighed, clearly annoyed by how difficult her father was behaving. "And still you won't send someone to steal an egg from beneath a sleeping dragon? You can't love me that much, then!" She frowned in desperation, walking over to her bed, throwing herself onto the silky sheets in the most dramatic way. "Leave me be, father! Let me suffer in solitude," she muffled into the pillow. The king sighed. "You can't always get what you want, my dear child. I love you, but I won't sacrifice my men just for a rare pet." With that, he left her room, shutting the door behind him. The princess groaned, slowly sitting up and looking around. She just wanted a dragon and no one, not even her father, would stop her from getting one! She rummaged through her closet, searching for her favorite cloak. If her father wouldn't send knights to find a dragon, she would go herself! And she knew just the right stable boy to accompany her. Someone had to carry her belongings, after all...
