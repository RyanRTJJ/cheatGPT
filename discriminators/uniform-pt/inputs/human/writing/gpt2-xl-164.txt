 I decided to go with a 1-15 scale instead of 1-10 hope that's not too big a deal. Criticism welcome. -- -- - I can read your numbers. Everyone has a number. It's not something that hangs in the air over their head, it just sort of.... Pops into my mind. The way someone stands, the look on their face.... The numbers, as far as I can tell represent how dangerous someone has the potential to be on a scale of one to fifteen. These numbers can change over time, my grandfather is a Vietnam Veteran, when I was younger his number was a seven, every few years it drops a point or so. Last time I saw him he was a five. When I look at pictures of him when he was younger he was an eight. Most people average at about four. Kids tend to be a two or three, the only "ones" I've ever seen are quadriplegics. The big numbers tend to be politicians and world leaders. Serial Killers usually hit in around ten. Leaders and Generals involved with wars hit around thirteen. The only fifteens I've ever seen are on old videos, at least until today, Hitler, Mao, Stalin, and all of the people that immediately surround them. The sorts of people who are responsible for mass genocide and similar atrocities. Today a new kid came to school. His number was low, a three, until he looked at me and smiled. Suddenly I felt this oppressive fear and I saw his number shoot to fifteen. I passed out, the school nurse sent me home. I've been loading dads gun, I can't let him live. If you had the chance to kill Hitler before he did anything wrong, would you? I've made my decision.
