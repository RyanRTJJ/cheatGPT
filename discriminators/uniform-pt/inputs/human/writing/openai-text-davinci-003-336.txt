 Oh shit. Was that Sally? I saw her at the end of the hall. I quickly took the first right turn. I had always been told that I shouldn't date in the office. That it made things awkward. "Don't shit where you eat", I believe was the colorful way it was phrased. I turned back my original direction at the next intersection. Well, it *had* certainly made things awkward. It wasn't a clean breakup. We had both said things that we shouldn't have. I, at least, regretted some of it. (Not all of it though). Sally turned the corner ahead. We both hesitated as we saw one another. I quickly turned into the restroom. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught her darting into the ladies room as well. This was starting to get ridiculous. I didn't have to go to the bathroom. How long should I sit in here so that it looked like I did. Three minutes? Five? I settled for four and walked opened the door. Sally was opening her door at the same time. We both retreated back into the bathrooms. This was insane. My eyes wandered the room. There was a vent. As I shuffled my way through the vent, I continuously derided myself. "This is so stupid" "All I have to do is just talk to her. Like this is any better?" "If I keep this up, I really *am* going to go crazy" I wormed my way up to an intersection. From the other direction I heard the sound of muted effort. *It couldn't be*, I thought desperately, just before I was proved wrong by Sally crawling around the corner. She stared at me with wide, startled eyes. "Soooo.... how have you been" I tried. "Good, good..." This was so awkward.
