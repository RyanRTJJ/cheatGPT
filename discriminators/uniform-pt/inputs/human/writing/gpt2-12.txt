 I'll never forget that night. The night that could have changed the world. I was destined to make history. Strange how I never wanted to follow in his footsteps. I wanted to write. My natural curiosity got me involved in my father's ambitions. I always respected him and knew that my choices reflected on him as well. All those years I had studied and read. I worked hard, Ivy league schools weren't easy. They never are when you're in your father's limelight. Then the war came. I knew I had to do my duty to my country, to freedom. If I didn't go, someone else would in my place. It was their I knew what I had to do to protect our freedoms. I came back and knew the only way to protect freedom was from the inside. Fortunately my timing was right. I was in the right place with the right people with the right ambition. I became more and more popular as a leader. I rose to great heights. That wasn't enough to satisfy my ambition, my destiny. I was meant to change the world! I could see a bright vision for the future. It seemed as if it were in my grasp. Alas, it was not the time or place yet. I had much to learn. Learn I did. In every meeting, hearing, lunch and social event. I traveled the ends of the globe and found answers. I cam back wiser than ever, and eventually more popular. I rose to be one of the highest figures in power. This was the closest I had been. It looks like I had been groomed my whole life for the position. I worked feverishly, beat the competition. I rose to the top. It seemed like everything was falling into place. Everything rode on November. I remember hearing the first time. I had won! The popular vote was mine. The electoral should come in soon and yes...... wait, I didn't win the electoral vote? Florida? Hanging chads...... I heard it on the news like everyone else. The decision was over. Bush won.
