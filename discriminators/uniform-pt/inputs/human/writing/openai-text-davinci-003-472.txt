 This is it. This was my chance. I was sick of it; the bullying, the ridicule, being put lower than everyone else. This would end it. They would know who I am after this. They would never be able to forget. I felt confident today; my backpack felt a little heavier and that felt good. My dad wouldn't notice his old.22 missing anyway. I had a pang of fear upon realizing I didn't bother packing any of my notebooks today. Ha, what a ridiculous thing to worry about now. I chuckled to myself a bit. At about this time, my English teacher is noticing I'm missing. He must be trying to call down to the main office to see where I am. I'll never be in that class again. No, today I start in the math room. That's where she is right now. I started to breath heavily. My blood felt like ice. A shiver went from my elbows, to my fingers, and back to my toes. It's too late to turn back now. I kicked the door as hard as I could. The class all looked up, startled. I unzipped my backpack and pulled it out. "Get on the fucking ground!" I saw her out of the corner of my eye, looking at me. She would never forget me again after this. I pointed the gun at her boyfriend; a taller, stronger man than me. He wouldn't be much longer. "You, stand up" I said coldly He slowly stood up, his palms were shaking. His teeth were chattering against each other at the base of his jaw. He suddenly thrusted his long arm into his pants pocket and pulled out a small revolver. With a swift motion he squeezed the trigger. I felt my body go weak as I fell to the floor. It went exactly as planned.
