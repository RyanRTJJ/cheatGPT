 My name is Sarah King, hello? Can anyone hear me? Hello? Sh*t! Nobody answered, nobody ever does. I'm starting to feel like we are the only ones left alive. The only memories I can recall are vague childhood memories of me eating ice cream with my parents. Out of all three of us I am the only one who knows technology so they sent me to try to contact people 5 times a day. "Sarah?" My mother was calling me to the other room for a daily family meeting. I see no point in these but I can still bear them for now. Sometimes I see them in my dreams, the people who I think sent us here. Who banished us to this hell, still I digress if someone were to come and rescue us, they would have by now. They wold have made contact with us in the 3 months we've been here. There is a handgun in the back of the building with 50 rounds, but my father doesn't think it's necessary yet. He thinks there is still hope for us. We've explored everything in a 10 mile radius, with no luck. I just don't see us surviving much longer. It's the 5th month and we are all starving to death, there is no more food, but the water supply is still more than half full. I dot. Think we can survive for another month. If anyone finds this building or happens to somehow find this journal,
