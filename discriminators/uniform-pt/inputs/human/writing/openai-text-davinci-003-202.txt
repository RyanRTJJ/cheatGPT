 I wonder how chairs are made. I see chairs everywhere, I mean every store window I look through has a fucking chair. But where do you go to find a good chair. I'm tired of this cheap plastic shit. I've been walking for fifteen minutes and my side's already starting to hurt, I could really use a chair. There isn't a good chair in this whole fucking town. The people here are too fat and stupid to even care about what their sitting on anyways. Then again if I wasn't a college fucking drop out I wouldn't still be living in this shit hole I call home. Sometimes I wonder what I hate more, this town or myself. Everyone else seems to be content here, maybe ignorance really is bliss. I bet as long as they have a Wal*Mart within walking distance they'd be happy. Though walking to them is about as forbidden as the fruit they never eat. Someone's out tonight. I can see their silhouette in the distance. That's weird, no one's ever out this fucking late. That's one of the few things I like about this places. It's quiet. Fucking hell the police don't even drive through here more than once a day. That's what makes this so easy. I'll just ask
