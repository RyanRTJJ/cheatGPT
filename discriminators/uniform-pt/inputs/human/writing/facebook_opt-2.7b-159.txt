 Know that this is not a story and no I am not doing this for any upvotes or opinions from any of you who find themselves reading what I have written. You should also know that everything I have written and am going to write is being typed as I think of it so please excuse any spelling mistakes. Have you ever felt as though thing were a little to real maybe a little to predictable? Well I have I don't know if I can blame any past trauma or blame the drug use either way one day things just felt a little to real almost to the point of being some fake predictable reality tv show only slightly better than what you may see on MTV. Now you may be asking yourself among other things what does this have to do with this writing prompt well simply put I have an ability of reading into the context of what's being said or done whether it be on tv or on the big screen, doing so helps me predict what's going to happen. If you will I have sort of an obsession with knowing whats going to happen, where most of you hate spoilers I rather enjoy them. Getting back on topic, seeing reality as yet again another predictable storyline being presented before me. I can't help but analyze the context of what's going on around me, the way someone speaks or how their body language presents itself is a rather dead give
