 I awake again, there is no light the humans are in bed. It must be late, I do wonder if that mouse has made an attempt to leave his home. What is that noise, couldn't be the mouse this is much too loud. It sounds like those clumpy humans, but they are asleep. I must investigate. While peering in from the kitchen I see humans I have never seen before, they are whispering and moving very quietly. Why have I never seen these humans before. I shall hide until I can figure out this situation. Watching from my under the humans eating place I see these new humans descend the stairs, I believe I shall follow from afar as to not be noticed. I do not trust these humans quite yet. The humans have entered the room with the powerful light, what is the meaning of this?? Even the little humans aren't allowed in there. Oh that wonderful smell I hope they leave the door open for me. Of course just like the loud human no entry for me. I wonder is that mouse going to come out again. I am sure of it, this is usually the time he tries to make a break for the couch. I will get him before he gets under.... Finally they are out..OH JOY they left the door open.... wait they have all of the plants in garbage bags....No I want to roll in those and nibble on the fresh leaves.... I must alert the human, this cannnot be right....HOLY SHIT THERE HE IS.... I knew you would try to make your move
