 My whole life people said two things about me, that I would never change and that I was always smiling. I grew up in a town just outside a fairly small city, I was privileged to go to one of the best schools in the country, for a small school it produced a huge percentage of professional athletes, world renowned scientists and political leaders. I spent those years drinking beers with my friends and having loads of fun. I got average grades and then went to the same college as most of my friends. I spent most of the time there drinking (legally for the first time) and having probably even more fun than when I was in school. A lot of my friends began to do pretty well for themselves, my best friend became an engineer and went on to become director of a car company. A couple of others were musicians or programmers who would make a lot of money. I enjoyed the time there. The most fun I had was when I got older, I really loved grabbing a pint with people who I hadn't seen in years. I found that although people had changed (some of them had loads of money or power and a lot of them had managed to be really successful), they were always delighted to go for a pint and it would only take a few for them to drop the'professional' act around me. When I died I saw my purpose in life. That purpose was to smile. My happiness lifted those around me without ever knowing it. There wasn't one moment of magic, I didn't make a major scientific breakthrough but that's fine with me because I never asked for that. In fact, I never asked for anything. I just did the only two things I knew well, which was to never change and just keep smiling.
