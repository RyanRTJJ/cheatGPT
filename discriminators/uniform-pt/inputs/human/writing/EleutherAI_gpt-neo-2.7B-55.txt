 I have life the better part of my life thinking about, "the one that got away," he couldn't get her off his mind, and all he wanted was to be in hers. Maybe she didn't get away, maybe his mistake at missing his only chance, at being to cowardly when the time came for him to "catch" her before she left, wasn't a mistake just a set back, a major one, but a set back nonetheless. He loved her, too much, he spent as much time as he could thinking about her, and when he wasn't, he wanted to be. For the better part of his life this was the case, seeing her was both Immensely pleasant and horribly torturous, because he also saw who she was with, a devil, in his eyes. A devil because his dream girl walked off with the Devils hand and not his own. Except today, today that devil was gone, and not coming back. He was conflicted by his feelings, hurt because she was hurt, because the pain that devil left her with was great, he had to take some and bare it with her. He was there for the girl, who's heart was burned by the devil, he was there too correct his mistake he made more than half of his life ago, and he felt joy because he was given a second chance. He hated this joy, she was sad and he was too, but with his joy he did not feel the same sadness she felt. A heart burned to the crisp by a devil does not heal easily, but for her, having him there, helped her. He put his own heart into hers, to mend hers, to bring her back to life and to let her live happier then she ever has before. He has finally fixed his mistake, took the step forward from the set back years ago, he got a second chance and he fixed things.
