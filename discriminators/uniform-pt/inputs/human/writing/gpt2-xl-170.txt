 Her hands were soft and pale. She raised them, slowly and deliberately, and caressed the trunk of the tree. It was hard, rough, and dark. There must be more. "What about after?" She remembered asking Adam. He had given her a blank look. "What happens after this? And after that?" She needed to know. Surely, there must be more. More than this beautiful, sprawling garden, where the trees swayed and the flowers bloomed and the fruits tasted of sweet perfection. What lies beyond? Adam had not known. "He knows," Adam had told her with a shrug. "Come, the peaches are ripe in the east of the garden." Eve had went along. The peaches had been ripe. But that question, that small thought that had grown into a yearning desire to know, remained at the back of her mind where she thought and wondered until it was burning at the forefront of her mind. That was when He came to see them. He knew all, saw all. Eve could not hide her desires if she wanted to, which she didn't. She ran to Him and settled there at His feet, and poured her desires and questions to Him. "There must be more, God." He simply looked at her and said nothing. Eve felt like she had done something wrong, and slowly got up and backed away. Just as she was going to turn around and leave, God spoke. "Listen not to the Snake, Eve; but to my words. This is where you are meant to be." Eve felt her heart drop. He knew about the Snake, too. Of course He did. But He could have stopped her. He could have struck her down, bound her to the earth she came from.
