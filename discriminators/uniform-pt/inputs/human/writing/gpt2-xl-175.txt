 I'm not the kind of person who would call themselves superstitious, because that implies a fear of the other side. Ghosts to me are just aspects of people that have been left behind, memories that we see in other people's eyes, their smiles, the way they talk with their hands. Ghosts are friends, they help us not forget the people and things we love. Today though, things are a little different. Standing on the other side of this door, I imagine more of a spectre or poltergeist than a ghost. I've been waiting my whole life for this moment, but now that it's here I can't seem to wrap my head around it. Rather than think too much about it, I take in the giant oak doors before me - a little unnecessary if you ask me - and the intricate iron detailing that whorls it's way across the wood. Brass handles in the shape of lions stare out at me, challenging me to take the next step. I reach out and caress their noses, worn down by years of use. I feel intimidated by this house; I don't belong here, in this world of crystal and fine champagne. Deep breath. You can do this. I reach into my pocket and take out the crumpled note, eyes passing over the careful, almost childish lettering. I know it by heart at this point, but seeing something left from her is somehow comforting. Another ghost to stand beside me. I let my hand fall to my side, brush the sweat from my palms, and take another breath. Before I can reach for the handle the door is pulled open, and I see a finely dressed, middle aged man who looks more anxious than I feel. I wonder hysterically for a moment if by standing out here I really have summoned an army of ghosts. He looks at me with a peculiar mixture of sadness and excitement. "I was beginning to think you weren't coming."
