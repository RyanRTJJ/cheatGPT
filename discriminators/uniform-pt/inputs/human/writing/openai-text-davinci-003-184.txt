 Allie opened the front door as quietly as she could, she never knew when Mom would be in one of her drunken stupors. She peered around the door into the foyer, and couldn't believe her eyes. More empty beer bottles than she had ever seen in her life were strewn across the living room floor. She tried to creep into her room, but the beast on the couch began to stir. Her voice cut through the air, chilling Allie's blood, "About time you're home, you little fat fuck. I've been waiting all goddamn night for you to feed me." Allie glanced at the clock, 6:45. That was alright, wasn't it? That wasn't going to get her hit tonight, or worse.... Mom had been like that for years now, ever since Dad died. She couldn't stand to cower and serve that thing, that thing which had overtaken her kind, caring mother two years ago. She ran, threw her books to the floor and ran to her room. She threw her mattress against the door, and her desk too. She gazed wistfully at her slender blonde figure, gingerly touching each spot on her arms and chest where she hid the bruises. She looked into her own eyes, nearly asking her own reflection for a way out. With a sigh, she bent down, untying the white high top sneakers which hid the cigarette burns on her ankles. Suddenly, a little white blur caught her eye, and a little vial with an inscription: "For Alice." Nobody called her by her full name anymore. She looked up quizzically, her reflection was beckoning to her, asking her to come closer. In between the legs of her reflection paced a little white rabbit, frantically tapping his pocket watch. She looked at the vial, and the inscription had changed. "drink me"
