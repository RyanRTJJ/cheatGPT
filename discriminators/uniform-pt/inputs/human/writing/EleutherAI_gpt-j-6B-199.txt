 So I thought it would be fun to participate in this year's secret santa. Going online, I retrieve my match. It says that I'm supposed to send something to the following address: 666 God Damn Court, Hell. As for a user, I somehow have access to every single troll that has ever existed or ever will exist on the Internet. Now what do you get Satan? Well it was a no brainer for me. He had posted links to a few pictures under his interests tab. Lets just say I regret clicking on them; curiosity got the best of me. But they made it clear what he needed. And so I wrapped his gift, packaged it up, and dropped it off at the post office. Surprisingly the clerk there said the address wasn't a problem; apparently they delivered to it all the time. As I walked out, I decided that I would never visit that post office again, and pray that I would never see that clerk again. And then I waited. A few days passed. The tracking info said it had arrived. But Satan didn't post anything. Another few days. Still nothing. Weeks passed by and I gave up. Satan refused to acknowledge his gift. It wasn't until a year later that I got an e-mail saying Satan had finally posted a picture of his gift. Across the photo, in big flaming letters, was “ WTF! ” Apparently he wasn't too crazy about the bible I sent him. I'm not even religious, so I thought this whole business of him being Satan was some made-up bullshit anyways, but apparently it wasn't. If you'd seen the links he had posted though, you'd have sent him a bible too. The boy needs to learn some morals. The women, the goats, the tires, everything else in those photos, their positions… I'm not sure I can ever scrub that from my mind.
