 The beach was beautiful that day. The Sun was blindingly bright, reflecting off of the ocean, but my sunglasses made it manageable. As I looked at the cloudless sky above, my furry friend Henry began to bark wildly. This wouldn't have bothered me had it not been for his tone: this was his alert bark! I quickly jumped up from my place on the sand and began to scan the beach around me. The only thing I could think of was that a body had washed up. I then looked down at Henry, who seemed to be alerting in almost every direction. I petted him in an attempt to calm him down, and it worked a little. He stopped alerting everywhere and began barking towards the dunes behind me. I decided to let him follow the smell, so I gave him the command. He took off, me running as fast as I could just to keep up, and ran to the top of a nearby dune. At the summit, he stopped, turned to look at me, and barked once. I arrived at his side, looked around for a moment, and realized that Henry was looking out at the ocean.
