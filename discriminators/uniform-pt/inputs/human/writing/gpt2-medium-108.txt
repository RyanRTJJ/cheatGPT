 She looked up to see her face in the mirror that hung on the wall. A simple glance would show the mirror was twice as tall than wide. The gold shimmered from the light given by table lamp that perched on the drawered chest. Details of oil screened paint overlaid the aura in pink, purple and blue feathered loops that fanned out over the frame. Her face took up the lower half of the reflection like a moon with the dark room hovering overhead. In the darkness of the room behind her, was a curtainless window. The coverings were white in the daytime but at night in a dark room, they looked dark gray. No other details in the room are seen. The hanging darkness consumed the comforts that adorned her walls - no pictures, no lights. She glanced up again and there was a moment when her heart began to pound in her chest. The details of what she saw in the mirror frightened her. The horror! "Oh my! What's that?" she murmured so as not to create noise to disturb the silence. "That is absolutely unacceptable!" Leaning forward, she moved closer to the desk to look at the mirror hoping to understand what was to be seen in the surface. Reaching out she removes the mirror from the wall. "This mirror is filthy! Am I the only person around here who cleans this damned place?" She mutters to herself, takes her cleaning cloth and wipes it. The dust moves but the mirror is still dirty. She rubs harder but they stick to the surface. "Spots? Gross. How did they get here? No one uses this mirror to brush their teeth." After spritzing water onto the glass and wiping it with the cloth it becomes clean again. She hangs the mirror back on the wall. It's not easy since the mirror has three notches on the hook that holds it to the wall. She fixes the frame by nudging it to position and it looks straight again. "There. All better," she thought to herself,"
