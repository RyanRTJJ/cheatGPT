 I touch my fountain pen to the paper. The words are written in every language known to man in hopes that there is no value lost in future translations. "Love one another. No act of violence is justified whether verbal or physical. The most valuable place you will find is found within yourself. To reach this place requires self awareness. To obtain self awareness you must spend less time talking about people and events. Talk about ideas. Question everything; including your own words and actions. **Spend time in solitude. ** The least valuable place you will find is within yourself. To reach this place you only need to lack self awareness. Self awareness can conquer the worst challenges you can imagine. Self awareness is not what you seek, but what you seek requires self awareness." The last line is to prevent idiots from trying to interpret self awareness as something it's not. I know it's going to happen anyways, so I just tried to minimize it. Self awareness is an internal tool for growth. That tool can move mountains and eliminate suffering because what is within us is projected externally onto our environment. If people improve what's within them, they improve what's without them. **Here's an example: ** A person is depressed. They begin to question their feelings and realize "I don't want to feel this way. Why do I feel this way?" which can lead them to understanding that they feel this way because of their thoughts. So they focus on their thoughts and realize it's very negative and unwanted. So they begin to ask themselves "Why do I say these negative thoughts? They are unlike me and I do not want them". Steadily they begin to realize that they are not their thoughts because the "I" that they claim to be, does not want negative thoughts. They begin to dissolve the negative center within their thoughts that makes them unhappy and unwell by
