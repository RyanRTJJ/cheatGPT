 He drifted slowly to sleep, sinking into his soft covers and feeling the darkness envelope him. As usual, a thick fog began creeping into his mind until, slowly, the beginnings of a landscape could be seen through the endless gray. A long and empty road, a lone flickering streetlight; the moon hung full in a clear sky. Like every night for almost as far back as he cared to remember, he visited this road. It didn't lead to anywhere. He could walk for hours and nothing would change. The first time he stumbled upon this weary and dark landscape still stuck in his memory. It was countless years ago, but it wasn't on purpose. He was a much younger and happier man. That night, the air was thicker. A low growl permeated the world around him. The light flickered a few more times before it lost power, plunging the road into darkness. The growl, now more of a roar, seemed to fill his mind until he no longer knew where it was coming from. He started to panic. Could it be? Was it possible that the creature of the nightmares of his youth had returned? Then the whispers began, and cold air drifted down his spine. Terrified, he jolted himself awake, and jumped out of bed. It would be a while before he purposely visited the land of dreams. Immortality is a strange thing. It begins as the most amazing thing you can think of. Unlimited time seems like a blessing, until everything succumbs to the passage of time except you. With no end in sight, any immortal man would eventually dream of an undisrupted rest. Luckily for this man, he had that chance. The road in his dream fell into blackness as the streetlight went out. A low growl filled the air and a tired smile touched the man's lips.
