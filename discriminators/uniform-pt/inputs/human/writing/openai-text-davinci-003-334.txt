 My darling divine, just another cup of that warm warm body. To taste your sweet notes, your depths of caramel laced richness once more would be to die complete. As I write this, I can feel your wetness against my mouth, smell your sweet aroma invading my every sense. I see you everywhere, with other men and women, and I envy them with all my heart. I see you being carried by that business man, watch in horror as he touches his greedy lips against your heat. I can not bear to see it. You have scalded me with your love. Remember those mornings we shared together? When the kitchen was filled with steam from your completeness and we listened to the sound of birdsong as I ate biscuits soaked in your love. I want to cover you in chocolate, in cream, I want to feel that spike of adrenaline as I indulge once again. You woke me up every day to feel alive. You are the first thought on my mind. You are the only thing I crave. I spent a fortune on you, and asked for nothing in return but your all. Every day I visited you in secret, against the advice of others, and we sat together
