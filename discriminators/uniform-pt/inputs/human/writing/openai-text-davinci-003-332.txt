 The three adventurers plodded down the dank halls of the labyrinthine cave, each with their weapon at the ready. Suddenly, one of them spoke. "Hold on a minute." The other two, a warrior from the hills and an Amazon from a distant jungle, turned to look at their companion, a young bespectacled wizard. "What is it, friend?" the warrior spoke.

"I don't know," the warrior said skeptically, "It seems fairly cool in here..." The wizard dismissed his skepticism with a wave of his hand, "there's still heat in the air, otherwise it would be freezing in here."
