 My God, we had been at sea for just a few weeks when it first appeared at the horizon. At first, we thought it had been an oddly shaped hill. That seemed to appease the men but over the days it grew and to me, as well as the men I suspect, the evidence was clear that it wasn't a hill, or a mountain. "The men grow restless." He said in a flat tone. It was always so hard to read the Gothi that I brought. I think this is what drew me to him, even as a small boy. He always left you guessing if what he said was the truth, always searching for the truth. "I think only a few of them ever really believed it was a hill in the distance. The face on it sealed the minds of those men. What do you make of it?" I tried to make my tone non-committal and indifferent, the voice of a true warrior but I am sure Gothi could see through me as he always has even with his current state. Thinking deeper, I'm not sure I wanted to know the answer, not after yesterday. "Well, even when it first appeared I thought it was Valhalla. As it grew in the sky I was more and more sure of myself. The face, I thought, was the collective of the gods looking down at us, guiding and watching. After the storm of light yesterday, the path has become as clear as my new eyes." "NEW ORDERS! ABOUT FACE! RETURN TO PORT!" It was clear, those on the Isle of Thor were needed if we were to traverse any further west. (meta: let me know what you think, brutal honesty. I'm new to writing.)
