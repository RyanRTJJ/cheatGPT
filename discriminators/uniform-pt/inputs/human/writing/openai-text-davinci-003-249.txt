 Where do babies come from? And where do they go? So small, so tiny! Surely Mother must know! . "What the *fuck* did you say?" she asks, with big black eyes. Her breath smells funny, oh no! It's the monster in Mother's disguise. You hide under the table with your trusted ted, but oh no! Alas! Her claws still find YOUR head. . "Where do babies come from and where do they go? Oh when I'm finished Child, surely this you will know." Oh how the words sting! Oh how they burn! The men held her down, and each took their turn. . And so here it is. You learn how wars really go! not machine guns and turrets but soldiers peckers, Forced into village girls, right in their down-below. . "Why are you crying?" she pushes your chest. You'd like to go bed now, so just that you suggest! "You asked for a story, and a story you'll get." She pulls out a coathanger, and you start to sweat. . "The girls screams whistled through the trees, Through the trees, whilst blood dripped down their knees! For the coat-hanger was forced deep in the lady, scrambling and killing what was left of her baby!" . Somehow you whipped, and dodged, and span, and twisted.
