 Death's empty eye sockets glared at the dartboard. He picked up another dart, took aim and threw. The dart flew through the air heading straight towards the very centre of the dartboard. Once again however, Death's dart swerved away from Steve's face at the last possible moment. Death roared in frustration. "Howwww? Even his picture is protected from my grasp." He slumped down into his armchair and sighed. Death was under a huge amount of pressure from below to get the job done. Steve was originally meant to be taken whilst he worked in the twin towers. A lot of people were taken that day, but not Steve. It was almost inconceivable, but that morning Steve's alarm didn't wake him, then his car wouldn't start and finally he got on the wrong train. He never even made it to work that day. Death had attempted to take him on 500 different occasions since then and each time Steve had miraculously escaped. "Miraculous... I wonder... "Death pondered. He was a good Death, he thought. Fair. Only took what was was needed - never too much. Not like his predecessor in the 1940s. But today was Death's last chance to take Steve or he was going to be out of a job. Replaced by someone younger who could'get the job done'. But that wouldn't happen - Death had planned this meticulously over the last two months. Steve was this very minute in a plane about to explode above the most shark infested water in the entire Atlantic. -- -- - "Death, come in please. He survived. Can you explain this? A pack of dolphins?.... You can't be serious. I am sorry but I need you to hand in your scythe. And you cloak. Goodbye Death."
