 I remember it as if it was yesterday. The giant thing stood above me. Pointing this thing towards my eye. I tried calling out to the others but froze under the dropping point. Then he stopped. The world sang in glory as my life was saved. I turned to Glen who was munching away at his veg and protein. It seemed like no one else was bothered by the fact I was almost hurt, but I know they cared. I tapped at the pointy thing and it didn't move. I tapped at his hand and he didn't move. His stomach, face, leg, nothing seemed to move him. So I went back to sharing a meal with Glen. Glen and the others ignored it, going around their daily lives but I knew not to trust him. I made sure to watch it. Perched on his shoulder I kept an eye on the evil point that almost took my eye out. -Day Sunny- Glen and all are gone now. Some creepy shadow thing came and took them. It made this low murmuring sound and tried to bite me. Luckily I jumped onto the giants head. -Second Day Sunny- The giant blinked at me. The pointy thing was put down. But most importantly he blinked. I knew it was plotting something. -Running Day- THE GIANTS BAD!!! IT STARTED CHASING ME WITH THE POINTY THING, I SHOUTED RUN
