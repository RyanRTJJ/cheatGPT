 It took years of training. Xie Li studied under the best historians of ancient languages and cultures, but he knew that success would depend on his ability to quickly understand any flaws in his language, mannerisms and dress and change them before he stood out. The training paid off. Sent back to Kiev in the year 1235, he eventually met up with the Mongol force and joined their ranks, blending in nearly flawlessly. The fact was the world was too peaceful. Following the Mongol's conquest of Europe in the mid-13th century, they repressed European society. War became almost non-existent as China dominated the world and kept the European, Africa, and later the Eastern continent's indigenous population down. They allowed no technological innovations. No weapons outside of swords and clubs. Only the Inca and Aztec posed even the slightest challenge, and they were defeated within a century by the empire in Beijing. When the first alien attacks hit in 2034, nobody knew how to defeat such overwhelming weapons. The full invasion force was nearing Earth. It would arrive within two decades. So here was Xie. He needed to sabotage the Mongol force while making sure that gunpowder, that crucial secret and lost weapon, made its way into an independent Europe's hands. Every mathematical model run by the historians said that if Europe avoided Chinese conquest and obtained gunpowder, that they would develop within centuries the weapons needed to fight the coming invasion. Gunpowder seemed like such a simple thing. Just some chemicals that exploded when combined. Xie really didn't understand how Europe could turn such a minor chemical reaction into a weapon capable of killing the millions of aliens that were coming. They'd have to use it a lot and go through dozens of generations of evolution, which seemed unlikely. But it wasn't his job to question. He had a job to do.
