 "Wait, what do you mean my owner?" said the orange tabby. The cat laid upon the counter, and momentarily stopped licking his paw, curiously awaiting my reply. "You know, your owner, the people who brought you in today for your check up?" I replied nervously. "Ohhhhh, them, haha owners, you called them? Those are my worshippers." The cat resumed licking itself cooly. I set the clip board down on the table, and wheeled over on my stool. I gave him a pat on the head, he looked at me disapprovingly. "No touch" said the cat. Fair enough. "Why do you call them worshippers?" I asked. "Why wouldn't I? You call them owners, I'd call that misguided. Let's look at the facts here. They have built me a palace, and attend to it daily, keeping it clean so that I may enjoy it. Three times a day I am fed, only the finest vittles from silver cans. Then in the evenings, after a day of lazing about, they come in the room and rub me. Worshipping my fur, and my beauty, they leave offerings to me in the form of mousey toys which I amuse myself with occasionally." "Well I.... I guess you're right." I replied. "Obviously." the cat retorted, "And if you can argue with that, then argue with this. When I take a poop, the worshippers come in and take it away. From what I believe that take it to another room, likely collecting it, to further worship my excrement. I am their God. And they are my loyal devotees. My temple attendants." The cat stood, and vomited on the table. "Now clean that up." he said.
