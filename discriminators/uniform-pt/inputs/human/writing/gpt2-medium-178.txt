 You think that having super powers is great or good or at the very least ***interesting*** right? Well, you obviously haven't heard of how I figured out my powers.'But Kyle,' you say,'I've known you for years and you're just about the most normal person I know.' To which I say,'Yes, that's how you know I have powers'. Let me explain, most people in the town have a run in with a super at least once a week, hell, you just told me about your blind date with Dr. Goo yesterday.... By the way, nice to know you had a good time. But that's besides the point. The point is, I've never even met one, *ever*. I didn't even think about it until a couple weeks back, there was the brawl between the guy with the windy powers and that batman ripoff that always goes around with that paladin chick, you know, the one that would be right at home in Sailor Moon? Anyways, I went out for groceries while that was going on. And you know what? Nothing happened. Not even a stray wind to blow my hair out of place. I didn't find out what was happening until I passed a TV store and saw it on the news. Anyways, I went home and I got to thinking. And the more I thought, the more I figured it out. I am abnormal, *because repel supers*. I'm not even joking, I had to go out of my way to find someone with super powers, and asked them to try using them. Poor guy was thrown about twenty feet. Anyways, I'm telling you this because I had to tell someone my plan. I'm going to clean up this town and it's infection of Super powered people. I do hope
