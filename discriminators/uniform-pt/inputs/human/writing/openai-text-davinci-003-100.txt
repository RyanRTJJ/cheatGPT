 **One day, while petting your cat, you accidentally pull his tail, and it opens up. Inside, there's a USB connector. You connect it to your laptop, an announcement pops up. -Cat Version: 1.0.0. Update to 256.3? ** "Well, well, well! I knew that eating nails was strange and now we know what's what!" Remey looks up at me with the smug smile I always knew was just a little wrong for a cat and smiles smugly. I click yes. *The charge for upgrades 100 and 200 are $ 3000 and $ 5000 respectively. Will you accept the charges? * I can't afford $ 8000 dollars. I might not have a place to sleep next month is I add $ 8000 dollars to my credit card balance. Of course I click yes. How could I not? *Upgrades downloaded. What is the name of your cat? * "Remey." *Does Remey have access to a variety of heavy metals and noble gasses at your location? * "Umm.... nope." *May Remey leave to locate those materials? They will be necessary in order to complete his upgrades. * "OK..... hello? YES!" *Thank you. The average time to acquire the necessary materials is 49 days. Goodbye! * Remey took off toward the door and I didn't see him for two months. Two months of anticipation that pushed all boundaries of unbearable. It was worth it. I hate flies and love chocolate. He shoots lasers out of his eyes
