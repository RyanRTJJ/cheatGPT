 "Hurry up and finish your ice cream or you'll miss the bus" Jane said to her daughter as she watched her eat the last bite. The morning show played in the background with an interview of Morgan Spurlock's new self help book,'Make it a Double'. It was already selling out in stores nation wide after his widely successful documentary on the proper diet needs of the average person. There wasn't a person these days that didn't at least try and follow the'Super Size Me' diet. As Jane's daughter left for school, she searched the fridge for something to eat but noticed her daughter finished the entire pint of ice cream. Jane kept looking and came across a head of broccoli and decided she was good this past week and earned alittle treat. One bite in and Jane felt regret. "Your better than this" she thought to herself as she took another bite. She had come a long way to get to a healthy weight. She owed alot of it to the delicious menu items at Mcdonalds and KFC. Never the less, she ate the broccoli down to the stem and sunk down into the couch. Jane quickly drifted off to sleep. Her husband opened the door, after coming home for lunch, to find her covered in left over broccoli. "Jane!" He exclaimed. "I thought we finally had a handle on your diet" "I know, I know.... it just looked so good and green" she replied. "Well you need a healthier dinner than. I'll stop and get some pizza on the way home." Said the husband. As he left for the afternoon, she flipped on the tv. "Today we will be making orange and chocolate slices. It's okay to be alittle bad here and there" squawked the TV. As Jane sat back watching the show, thinking about how to get out of having to sit through a meal of deep dish pizza that night, still feeling lethargic from her morning treat, she drifted back to sleep.
