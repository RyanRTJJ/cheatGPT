 "All those years?" I was crying. "I missed you so much. I hated everybody. I took out my loss for you on them. Now you come back. Finally." "Yes," she said firmly. "I promised I would always love you. I have fought everything to save the people I found myself amongst and when we made it they wanted to make me queen or something but I refused. I didn't want to govern anybody or anything. I wanted them to be free and that's self rule to me and I just wanted to come home to you." "But it has been so long and it hurt so much," I stared into her eyes. "You might not like what I have become." "We can fix anything," she insisted. "I set the space ship to trace you and bring me straight to you. You are everything to me and now I have you again." "But I'm changed," I was holding my head in my hands. "You deserve better. Much better." "You aren't married," she looked suddenly worried. "Or in a relationship or something are you?" "No, No," I said, "There could never be anybody but you. I could never love anybody else." "So what have you done with your life?" she brightened up. "You seem to have a pretty nice place here." I drew a deep breath. She had to know. "I am James the Imperator," I said. "I am Absolute ruler of the whole Earth. Well. All that is left after my wars of conquest."
