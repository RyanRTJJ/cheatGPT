 "So.... we could open a park where people could go to and view live cloned dinosaurs. Of course, people would loose interest with the park within ten, maybe fifteen years. Revenue would decrease, and even if nothing ever goes wrong, the projected insurance costs alone would sink us." "But opening a park filled with giant untamed dinosaurs has been my dream. What other choice is there?" "Well, I've spoken to the scientists and geneticists and they told me it takes far less time to clone a part of an animal compared to the whole thing. Plus, you don't have to bring it up to completion. And I was thinking, why not mix the two? We can clone dinosaurs, put them into a safe coma until they become adults. Then gently euthanize them, take their meats, stuff their bodies and put those on display while serving people Dino-burgers and Stega-Steaks." "You want to... clone the dinosaurs just to EAT them?" "No, not all of them. Just the ones we'll put on display at each restaurant location. In fact, a different stuffed dino can be seen and ridden and photographed with at each location. People would travel to all the different restaurants just to have their picture taken with the whole set. But mostly, we'd be serving cloned meat that was never part of a living animal, but instead chosen for its deliciousness.
