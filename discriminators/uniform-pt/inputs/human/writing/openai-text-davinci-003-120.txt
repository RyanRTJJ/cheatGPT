 I loved Alice. She was my everything. We got off to a strange start though. She never talked to anyone, but I made her speak to me and it changed everything. We both discovered we have the same hobbies, interests, favorite foods, TV shows, you name it. The only thing I didn't like was she never could talk to other people so I had to speak on her behalf. She would tell me what she wanted to say and I'd simply relay it to whoever she wanted to hear it. When this happened people often just told me that my relationship was'unhealthy'. I'll admit it was kind of a strange thing to have to do, but I didn't care. I loved her and she loved me. After some time, we decided to get married. We held our own small ceremony, although none of her family showed up and very few of mine did. Those who refused simply repeated what I've heard time and time again.... that our relationship was'unhealthy'. I still didn't care. We were so happy together for several months until my mother passed away. Usually we could handle anything together but this was different. I decided to see a therapist to help me, and after some sessions she recommended a drug to me to help me. I don't remember what the drug was, all I can remember is Alice begging me to never take it. She said that it would ruin what we had together and change who I was, but I couldn't take the burden any more. She left me.... I just want to hear her voice again.... -- - First submission here!
