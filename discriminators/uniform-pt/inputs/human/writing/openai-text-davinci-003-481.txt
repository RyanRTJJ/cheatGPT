 I check my belt. Susie, my Marowak is leading. She can take out Pikachu. Louka, my Lucario is second. I can bring him out to tackle anything else. Edgar, my Gengar can do the rest. And of course if I get into trouble I have the others. So I stepped out of the shadow into Veridian Forest. Ash was heading home and he'd probably be here soon. I bring out Louka, the plan starts. After a couple of hours of waiting he stepped out of the trees. Great Misty and Brock are here too. "Hey wan na battle?!!" I yell in my best joyful voice. God I hate these charades. Ash, being himself, sends out Pikachu. And so it begins. I send out Susie and she begins the attack on Pikachu. It's thunder is useless. I then tell Louka to use Aura Sphere, it hits Misty in the stomach and sends her flying against a tree. Blood starts dripping down her neck. Brock and Ash then realise I'm not to be toiled with and bring out other Pokemon. I bring out Edgar and my Gardevoir, Anna. I have Shelly, my Luxaray for the water types and a Goodra, Harry, to gain the favour of Goomy, Our Lord and Savour. I wipe out their low leveled team with ease. I finally understood WHY Ash had never become Champion of a Pokemon league. Soon it was Ash and Brock against my team. I recalled Harry and Susie. Susie, for one, had seen enough death. I had Ash and Brock surrounded. Once my Pokemon finished the onslaught I made sure Misty never woke up. No loose ends
