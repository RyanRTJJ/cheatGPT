 "Sam I am I promise, Mam. No, I will not eat you out. I can smell your eggs, are they masked in sauerkraut? No, I will not eat you out. Holy shit, your nipples are so green they look puffy and rot. Sam I am, I promise, Mam. I will not fuck you here in this parking lot. I will not fuck you to hit your G-Spot. I will not fuck you from behind. Now, listen here, WILL YOU MIND. Sam I am, I promise, Mam. I would rather eat a sandwich made of rat and jelly, Then look at you and your big fat belly. I can only offer you my condolences and the pleasure of offering you the only thing that would touch you, this here feather. I will not drill your brain. I will not cuddle while staring at the rain. I will not shit on your chest .... but perhaps pleasure may come while you rest. While you nap I may take a crap And while it pours I may fuck to the rhythm of your snores. Those pillows you sleep on with the goose feathers Makes putting up with you oh so much better in leather.
