 I crawled out of my dark and dingy cave, slowly moving towards the entrance. "outside, what place is that?" I muttered in my head. I reached my hand out towards the door handle before stopping myself. I decided to first peer through the lock. My eyes were meet by the brightness of a light, slowly I turned the door handle and swung open the door. Cautiously I peered outside. My eyes felt a strong sting and I winced at the brightness. My vision remained blurred from the presumably lower fps. I rubbed my eyes and opened them. The vision held before me was like nothing I had ever seen before, a vast green landscape, with bright vivid colours. I forgot my sheltered life style and strayed from the doorway, that was my mistake, I felt the soft green grass beneath my feet still wet with morning dew. I looked up and saw a vast blue sky and amazing puffy white clouds. I turned towards the light source. The sun burning brightly in the sky. I starred at it basking in its glory. My eyes began to water but I could not undo my locked gaze on this majestic creation. Suddenly my eyes could no longer stay open and shut closed. I screamed in pain clutching and clawing at my face. My retinas were burnt. I stumbled back falling over a root landing in a dank and cold patch of muddy earth. A bird overhead chirped in a seeming taunt before unleashing a rain a diseased feces down upon me. I rolled in agony on the ground. I peeled open my eyes and set my gaze towards the door to my home, my cave, a place that never hurt me and always welcomed. I sprinted on all fours to the door. In my head I could feel the crushing gaze of all the evil behind me.
