 Lefty, stop being a complete fucktard. You're not useless, too dumb for school and the marines is not your only option in life. You're a fucking idiot for the way you treat the girl you love. Stop thinking that she's going to leave you for not being a greek god in the sack. You're seventeen years old! You'll always learn new shit to do and try. And do you want to know a secret? It's always more fun and exciting to explore and learn when you do it with someone you love and trust. Don't assume the tough guy persona just because people think you're the strong, silent type. You don't have to leave everything and everyone behind because you want to see the world. The only thing that'll come out of it is you being a fucking loner with no ties to anything, looking at life passing you by through an invisible window, keeping you from interacting with the very world you wanted to be a bigger part of. It's ok to be sad, it's ok to talk about how you feel. Don't let your grandparents insults and beatings be a reason for you to shy away from the people around you. You are good enough. You matter. You can do everything they tell you that you're too dumb for. Most of all. Trying to end it will only make it worse. In a few years, when you're alone on guard duty. Don't make your brothers in the service the only reason for not pulling the trigger. Make connections that matter enough to not even put the barrel to your head. Shit will get better, you'll experience a lot of pain, but it will
