 We had planned to invent a time machine. A way to look at the past, to wonder at the Pyramids as they were being built, to see Elizabeth in her Court, to be there as Napolean was finally defeated at Waterloo - and, if we were being honest, to win a little bit of money on the horses. It didn't turn out that way. Unfortunately, there seemed to be some quite hard limits on how time travel worked. We don't pretend to understand the physics, but it works like this. 1. You can not travel into the future. 2. You can not travel more than sixty seconds into the past. 3. You can not travel within sixty seconds, in either direction, of another machine firing. 4. Your location is remains constant to your previous position. 5. Your velocity remains constant to your previous velcoity. We would never see the Pyramids in all their glory. We could never even be able to win a bet at the races. However, it turns out NASA was very interested in our little machine, due to that fourth little dot point. You see, the earth is travelling fast. Very fast. In fact, we don't even know how fast it was travelling. We won't know until tomorrow. You see, we have no way of calculating the absolute velocity of an object as there is no static reference point. However, with our technology, and its ability to displace something
