 It took me a long time but I finally realised the truth. And when I did I laughed long and hard, standing in my front yard as I watered my petunias. "You alright over there, Bill?" shouted my neighbour John. He, too, was watering his petunias. "John," I said, "do you ever wonder why life here in the 200th Zone is so damn wonderful?" "Well now Bill," John replied, "that is a real doozy of a question. I'd say it's because we were tested as being in the top 0.5 % nicest and most innately good people in the world." I grinned and let my mask drop for just a moment. John didn't flinch. "Ha! I knew it!" I exclaimed. "You're just like me John. You faked it too. Tell me, when Mrs Finch disappeared last year, it was you wasn't it?" "Well now Bill," John said as he tilted his hat back, "she sure was a talkative lady. Gave me lots of tips about gardening. You could say that my beautiful petunias are all thanks to her....... contributions." "I wonder how many of us are here" I mused. "Well now Bill," said John. "I reckon it's pretty much all of us. I mean, no one is really a good person. I'd say everyone who scores above a 180 is probably faking it." I shook my head. Who would have guessed. The top 10 % of people, folks so nice they were seen as angels in human form were all high-functioning sociopaths.
