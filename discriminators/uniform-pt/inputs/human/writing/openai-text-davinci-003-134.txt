 "Got to remember my training. Patrol in a set pattern. Never deviate. Eyes forward, don't check behind me. Never, EVER look up." "Oh hey, Bob just got an arrow in his head. Time to run around like a chicken with my head cut off until we find who did it." "Wait a second, It has been 30 seconds. What was I doing? Oh right, I'm a guard. remember my training. Return to patrol. Follow it exactly. Hey there is Bob's dead body. Instructions said nothing about that, just keep going." "Follow the patrol and.... OOOH, SHINY!" "Someone dropped a coin over here. Neat. Wait a second, what was I doing? Oh yeah, patrol. Oh hello dead Bob. Door to the treasury is open. No instructions about that. Just keep going." One hour later.... "So Doug, care to tell me how a thief got into the treasury?" "No idea, sir. I followed the patrol instructions to the letter. Nothing more, nothing less." *sigh* "Yes, you do take things quite literally I see. Do you know what happened to Bob?" "Got an arrow to the head. I chased after whoever did it, but there was eventually no one there, so I returned to my patrol." "You did not think to say something?" "There are no instructions for that." *sigh* "SQUIRREL!" "Wait, what? Where are you.... Damn it, Fred get in here." "Yes boss?" "What have we been feeding the guards?" "Oh we got these new magic food pellets. They really sharpen the senses." "Perhaps to the point of distraction?" "That was a listed side effect, but what harm could that cause?" *big sigh* "Aw, the squirrel ran off. What were we talking about again, sir? Oh hi Fred, when did you get here?" *groan*
