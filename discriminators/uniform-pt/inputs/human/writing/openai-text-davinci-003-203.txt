 Pokémon or Hogwarts? I sighed and read the signature at the bottom of the paper. It was official all right. The choice was obvious, anyone could be a Pokémon trainer, and very few people were wizards. It was clear that Hogwarts was the better opportunity. But the loyalty, friendship, adventure, and love I'd be giving up would be so much.... I walked into Professor Oak's lab. If nothing else I would have to tell him that I was unable to take a Pokémon. When I walked between the row of computers, Prof. Oak gasped, and then a look of sadness came over his face. "Oh, I forgot today was that day! I'm so sorry I don't have any of the normal starters, but I'm sure I've got something for you..." He reached up to a box filled with Pokéballs and started ruffling through it. "That's okay, it doesn't matter-" I started, but he interrupted by whipping around and presenting a shiny Pokéball. "There! A Hoothoot." He pressed the button on the ball, and with a flash of light, a small owl appeared. "Hoot hoot!" It chirped, fluttering a little, looking up at me through its black rimmed eyes with love. It was perfect. This little bird Pokémon would be my friend all through my years at Hogwarts. I didn't have to choose, I could do both. I picked him up, and he let out a soft "hoooooooooot" closing his eyes and pressing his head into my chin. "Thank you so much."
