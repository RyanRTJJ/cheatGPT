 You will never give up. Others may falter and fall, others may stray the path, others may compromise, but *you* will keep fighting until your last breath. Every second of every day, you will use towards the plan. Not a single moment will pass where you are not fighting, or training, or learning, or plotting. You rest only to gather more strength for the fight. You wait only to find the opportune time to strike. And you play the fool in public only so that no enemy will suspect who you truly are. You will never give up. Nothing will sway you from the plan. No comfort, no want, no need. There is nothing now but the plan. Nothing matters more than the plan. No person, no thing, not even you. The person you were died on that day, so many years ago. Now there is only the plan. The impossible plan. The plan that only ends when every man, woman and child is safe, safe from fear, safe from harm, safe from oppression. The plan that only ends when no life is ever lost to violence, and no child must watch their parents killed in front
