 Well, we finally did it. First we sucked the Earth dry, burning every last drop of oil until there was no more to burn. Then we stopped the winds -- harnessing their power to fuel our greedy ambitions until they had nothing more to give. Now it was the ocean's turn. The world's governments have been slowly shutting down the hydro plants for a while -- they were using more energy than they were generating from the waves now anyway. Frankly, you couldn't even call them waves anymore. Anyone who had been to the beach in the last decade could tell you that this was coming. The only "waves" you'd see nowadays were the pathetic ripples generated by people splashing in the placid water. When we stopped the winds, ten million species of plants, animals, and insects languished in the dry, stale air. When we stopped the waves, we crippled the planet's number one source of oxygen and ten million more perished. Even if, as they claim, we have enough energy for two more generations, it won't even matter. The scientists say our atmosphere will no longer be breathable in less than ten years. The governments have a plan, though. Don't worry, they say. With a bit more energy they can fix the atmosphere -- to ensure that humans will survive to continue raping the very planet that gave them life for centuries to come. Looking up into the sky, I can see the beginnings of their new plan now. It started as a small dim patch on the surface, but now the black panels have spread like a rash over the surface of the sun, blotting out over a quarter of its light. When we've finally snuffed out the wind, water, and light, nothing
