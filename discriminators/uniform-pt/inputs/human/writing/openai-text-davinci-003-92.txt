 Dearest Sally, You have indeed been good all year long. I am delighted to give you a pony. You earned it, and don't let anyone tell you differently. I will make sure it's in the living room on Christmas Eve, right by the tree, but on only one condition. I care about my ponies very much. When people lose them or give them away, then they feel upset. If you accept this pony for your very own, then you mustn't let anyone ever take it from you. All you have to do is agree to love it forever. Sign your name on the enclosed piece of paper, and then the pony is yours. If you don't, then I can't leave it with you. I do hope that's not the case. You want a pony, don't you? Many little girls in apartments lie to me about it, and I'd hate to have to give your pony to another little girl. - Satan -- -- -- -- - Dearest Bobby, There's no need to lie to me about having been good. In fact, I found your behavior so delightful that I'll let you in on a secret. Did you know that children can also order whatever they want online? You don't even need mommy and daddy's permission. All you need is one of their credit cards. If you buy from a store they usually purchase items from, then they won't even know it was you and will blame each other
