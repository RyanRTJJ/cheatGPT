 Cursed is not the word. I am the last human and I am adrift in the void. It's been so long since I left the solar system. I have died billions of times; some I recall -- the major events that led me here. I was the last human long after humanity evolved to something I can't quite comprehend. I am static and it saddens me that I'll never join them. A recurring thought -- background noise. I was standing on Earth, briefly dead, then alive before quickly dying again. I watched the scene unfold slowly as the Earth was consumed by the Sun, as I was consumed by the sun. I would reform, ever so briefly inside the outermost layers of the Sun only to die nearly instantly. It was this way for so long. Over time, the ferocity of my deaths abated. The sun became transparent, punctuated by a small, brilliant white orb; and I drifted away. My life, as it is, has become a slow movie -- a few minutes alive and a few minutes dead. It's always suffocation and freezing. I have seen the stars die, and the lights fade from a rainbow hue to yellow and red; finally to blackness. I feel the tug of unseen giants lurking in the darkness and have felt their crushing strength. But eventually they too die and I am reborn from their absence. I am the last. I am lonely. I feel nothing. I remember; my last refuge. I remember my loved ones. I remember my childhood and my parents. I remember pleasure, pain. Unfathomable sadness and absolute joy; and I feel them. I remember light, and there is light.
