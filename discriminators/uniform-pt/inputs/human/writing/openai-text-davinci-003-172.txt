 In the United Kingdom, a tradition that would span through thousands of families, possible millions of families, was the complaining of insignificant inconveniences. *My neighbor's telly is too loud. Wrote the landlord a right note, that I did! * *The coffee shop ran out of stoppers, so I ended up with coffee on my brand new white shirt! * *The message in the metro simply isn't needed! We all know there's a gap! Why mind it?! * When the people cry, governments listen. Except if you are in the United Kingdom, the royalty simply ignore you, but that aside, the people rallied against this insignificant, yet distinguishing part of British culture. "Mind the Gap" The metro system received thousands of twitter petitions, loud internet arguments, thousands of strongly worded letters every year but no one did anything to stop this mild inconvenience to the public's ears. Then, one day, an intern and his buddy quietly snuck into the administration building that controlled and monitored the metro lines and said, "Let's have a go at it!" His friend would reply, "Going to have a well cheeky nandos." What the British would later name the Holy Gaps, the Trinity of Gaps or Great Gappening, struck fear into the riders of public transportation. Thousands upon thousands of people got their foot stuck into the gap, trying desperately to remove themselves from the situation. Police officers were unsure what to do, when one officer found a clause in the law saying that any British person, or person living that didn't mind the gap and consequentially entered into a state of being stuck, will be put down. The horror, as humans were treated as horses, as the police put down thousands of poor souls. However, London quietly went on. And to quote my good friend
