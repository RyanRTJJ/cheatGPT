 Hey so well done for being brave enough to put your work up being critically reviewed. Although I can see quite a few things I'd change I'd just focus on a couple of things the next time you write. For each character you write, make sure you can come up with at least a sentence about them. Currently I don't know a lot about your main character at all. I don't know what they look like, I know very little their personality just that single viewpoint they mention on society. Other than that I know their name and that's it. I think the trap that most new writers fall into is that while they might have this wonderfully developed character in their head, they don't actually put that on the page. While the plot may be interesting it's always the characters that give the reader someone they can root for or relate to that really keeps your reader invested. The other thing I'd mention is showing not telling. You very briefly mention the dad leaving and the mum dying. You can't just brush each of those events off in a single sentence. You need to show and explore the pain the mc has gone through. The effects on his life, how it's changed him. Think about Harry Potter. JK didn't brush off Harry's parents death in two lines. And after that she spent quite some time showing just how miserable Harry's life was now living with the Dursleys and showed it in several different ways.
