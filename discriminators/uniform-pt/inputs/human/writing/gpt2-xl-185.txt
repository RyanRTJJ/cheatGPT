 The shadows in the corners of the room had begun to expand and retract, dancing along the edges of Todd's vision. He could see clearly now what was going on, he was locked in a small cell in dungeon of limestone. There was dripping water next to a standing pool of water in one corner and a low cot in another corner. Odd, he thought, they had not shackled him to the cot as they usually did at night. Well no matter, that would be the witches final and fatal mistake. Long had he been planning this escape, since he had been captured by those men in suits of blue and taken from his family. But recently he had lost his drive for freedom. He knew it must have been the witches poisoning his mind, but no more! He would make his move soon. Through the bars of his cell, Todd could see the blank faces of his fellow captives shambling past, herded along by the witches for their twisted plans. Suddenly the cell door was thrown open. No, the witches must have learned of his plot! They had sent their brutish henchmen to restrain him, followed by the head witch herself with a vial of her evil mind bending elixir. Despite his strength of mind, his body was unable to fight off the overpowering force of the brutes. They held him down while the witch forced the elixir down his throat. Todd could feel his mind fading, his great strength was disappearing, clearness leaving him. No longer sure how long he would remain conscious, he struck out at everything around him. He made solid contact with something and felt a short moment of victory before he lost his last reserve of strength and slumped to the floor. & amp; nbsp; Edited for spelling Also planning on adding more to the story, after my calc exam: / & nbsp; EDIT 2: I'll have part two up today, sadly it's been on my laptop whose battery has decided it doesn't
