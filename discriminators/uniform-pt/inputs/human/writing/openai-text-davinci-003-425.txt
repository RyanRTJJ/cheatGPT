 Earth is chosen purely as a sentimental notion; perhaps an exercise to convince ourselves we retain some bit of humanity in our clouds. The planet is serene and peaceful - our first Accord having contained mutual agreement of non-involvement after we restored it to health. An additional Accord will need to be arranged soon - for Sol has only perhaps one billion years remaining and we are divided on letting it go or restoring it as well. We settle on Earth and as per custom, we disperse ourselves from whatever form (s) we have taken and relax into our component clouds. To those animals below, it must appear as the most wonderful thing. A snowfall of shooting stars as our clouds come from all corners of the cosmos, others abruptly appearing as they drift in from parallel worlds or personal dimensions. We come closer and closer, nearer and nearer as our clouds mingle and become more dense. Within moments we have pulled ourselves in as one - all of humanity within a few thousand square feet, a solid thrumming orb. We discuss. Nothing of this sort has been proposed before. It is a discussion forced by the refusal of other forces in the universe to accept us. We are tarnished, we carry stains, our minds reveal this. To ascend further, the proposal states, we must scrub ourselves of such stains. Consent comes after several seconds of deliberation, then comes several seconds more
