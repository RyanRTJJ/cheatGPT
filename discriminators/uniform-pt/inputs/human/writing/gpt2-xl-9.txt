 It seemed to last an eternity, the sharp, pinching bite, the hot, steamy blood, and then the cold, unforgiving nothingness. It was as if I had been like that for years, decades, centuries. And then I was back, but not.... there. *Who is that? * I think, looking at a familiar cadaver. *Oh my god! That's.... * I cover my mouth with my hand in disbelief. *It's me. * I whisper.

In their eyes I saw the thing that will never leave me. It was not only dread, not just horror.... but also betrayal. It was me! Out of millions of undead, I was the one to end their lives. I was the one who tore out my brother's eyes. I was the one to take a chunk out of my wife's thigh. I was the one that ripped out my little girl's heart
