 I've lived next door to Mr Wynn for the past seven years. He always seemed very gentle, very considerate. He never asked for anything, and was happy to listen whenever I spoke to him. A friend of his told me about the vow of silence he took, and about his dedication to the wife he lost so tragically all those years ago. The reason I am standing here today, despite the fact that I am not exactly a close friend or family member, is to say thank you, and pay tribute to a wonderful man. My daughter, Sam, would often talk to him. She would ask him why he doesn't talk, and he would just smile back at her. The attention span of a six year old being what it is, she generally moved on pretty quickly. He would let her pick flowers from his garden to bring home to us. His sprinklers were timed for when the kids arrived home from school on sunny days. He always had sweets ready on Halloween, and would feign terror when she arrived in her costume. Mr Wynn died saving my daughters life. She ran out onto the road, and he saw from the front garden. I didn't see what happened, I just heard Sam crying. I ran to her. She was crying for Mr Wynn. He had pushed her out of the way. He saved her. And before he passed he spoke to me. He asked me if Sam was OK. I nodded, and he just smiled and closed his eyes. If it wasn't for him I would have lost my little girl. Mr Wynn gave me the greatest gift anyone ever could, he gave me time with my daughter. I owe him more than I
