 One by one, the sea rose, and the live streams winked out. We watched the television screens from the top of the Rocky Mountains. They were wired all the way to the coasts, directly to the cameras recording the chaos. They were built to be waterproof, but none of them lasted more than a few minutes as the debris slammed into them; rocks, cars and — for a horrifying second — a child's hand, before they cut to a purple "NO SIGNAL" dancing into the corners of the screen. No one voiced their hopes any more: hope that the water wouldn't reach this high, that it would be absorbed by the Great Plains and break among the cliffs, transform the Grand Canyon into a mighty lake. Maybe that would stop the end, or simply delay it, as the mighty mountain rose from the bottom of the sea. We wondered about this vast new land about to be created. Scientists said it would be more than an island — a new continent, a fresh start. Some countries actually tried to annex it before they realized they had much bigger problems — namely, the displacement of billions of metric tons of seawater. It would be a while — maybe a year — before the fresh continent would break the surface, and even longer before it ceased to rise. Some even thought that other landmasses would rise, that we would soon see the inversion of the world. Everything that was once land would be water, everything water, would be land. But the end of everything would mean the beginning of so many things. As we waited, slowly, for our country to be swallowed up, I fell — most improbably — in love. And love defies endings. We sought an impossible goal — to travel across the Inverted World to the new landmass, where we could stake a claim. This is that story. **Author's note: Wrote this as a free write, but if people are interested in the premise, I might turn it into a longer piece. Comment if you like! **
