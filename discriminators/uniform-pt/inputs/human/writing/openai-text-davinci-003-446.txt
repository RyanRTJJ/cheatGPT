 You are alone. You there, in the void, on the cusp of a darkness you do not -- -could not know. We have enslaved before. But your planet will shine like a bright crystal in our hallway among the gallows of the lives we reap. Count your hours mortals, for we are coming.... Ours is the place amongst what you would call immortals: a place high within, yet without borders of the mind. We seep like a plague. Falling, drifting throughout the ages with none to stop us. You will be no different. This message is not a warning, not a tithing for a hope in escape. We want nothing from you. Nothing except your destruction into the eternal abyss of our realm. We are coming.... we serve only the dark which will blot out your sun as your worthless, wretched rock becomes cold and bitter. Your fruit will die. Your grain will die. Your cattle and livestock will die. Your young will perish at the beast. And when all hope is lost, and your feet and hands turn that same blue as the ice that surrounds you.... you will call upon us as you stare into the void which has become your once warm and holy sun. There, hung in the sky, will be the face of the enternal darkness -- -the face of us. And with open arms you will embrace us and thank us for saving you from the barren and dying expanse of life. It will be ours this life; given freely, from hands unbound and from feet unchained. You are alone.... for now. But.... we are coming -- -yes,
