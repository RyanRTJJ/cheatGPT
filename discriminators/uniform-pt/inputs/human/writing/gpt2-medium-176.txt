 Started at 13:24 MST. “ Tell me where she is! ” The boy sat huddled in the rubble, staring up at me doe eyed, taking in the gun and the jacket in quick glances, but remaining mute despite my pleas. I looked desperately around the broken room. This is where she had lived; I remembered the street number and had recognized the old tree sitting in the front yard. But the place was a wreck now, dilapidated walls crumbling under the forces of the bombs. Glass lay on the floor where the windows had been shattered, looters no doubt, taking the last of everything they could get a hold of, a cleanup crew for the armies firebombs. I had no doubt that they'd be back again after I'd gone, pulling the copper wires out of the walls, scavenging for anything they could get their hands on. I wasn't interested in any of that, I just wanted the girl, but this boy only sat there, only stared. Maybe he was a looter himself waiting for me to leave so he could resume his pilfering. I leveled my gun, and my gaze, and asked one more time in a dangerously quiet tone, trying to hide my desperation, trying to cover up the stink of my fear. “ Where is she. ” But the boy only watched, and blinked as a deep rumbling filled the dusty air. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
