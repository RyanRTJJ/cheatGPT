 I think it was Stephen King who said that if you ask 10 people to review your work and they all come back with different critiques, that your work is fine. However, if more than a few of them complain about the same thing, that's when you should take note. So consider that if I end up being the only critic for this work (I don't know who insta-downvotes a CC; that is messed up). There's no narrative reason why this story had to be first-person. Or to be fair, there's little narrative reason. During the first half when there were paragraphs of overly dramatic text between a just a few words of undescriptive dialogue, I thought the main point of the story was going to be how the character overthinks everything. But it didn't do anything with that concept in the end. So I feel there was no reason for the story to be first-person other than because the prompt happened to be written that way. The dialogue at the start was, "how are you doing lately?" "I'm fine." "Good." "Thank you, Nathan. How much?" And between those four lines was a seemingly 500-word dissertation on small talk from the perspective of introverts. And as I said, if the story were about how Max overthinks everything and lives inside his head, it would have worked well. Max would have blurted out all his thoughts, and the doctor would have said something along the lines of, "whoa, I was just asking about your team losing the game last night." But that isn't what happened, so all the extra paragraphs between the few lines
