 "And that is it." I said calmly. "Impossible! I-I was a national champ! Three years running!" He looked over the board. "Where did I go wrong?" I sighed. "13 Turns ago you began focusing on your left side, pressing an attack but not covering for it. I capitalized on that, and when I took apart your offense, you could not compensate fast enough. You needed more turns than you had in order to do so." ``.... So that's it." He sat back down, dejected. "Yes. I'm afraid this was your chance, but it's time to move on." I offered my hand to shake. "I loved your variation on the previous Canadian Champ's gambit, though. Please don't stop playing in the afterlife." He took my hand, warmly, and I guided him to the door.... and by the time I turned around, the chess table was gone.... replaced by an automated mahjong table, and three elderly souls coming in the room. So, they're going to tag team me? Smart. But they won't win. They can't. I've played their games since before mortals invented them. It's my job. Ever since literature and media suggested you could be brought back to life if you beat Death at a game, it has been my job to indulge them.... and defeat them. Chess, Mahjong.... I've even played video games, and played a young girl at the Pokemon Card Game. (She had an adorable Fairy-Type Deck centred around Sylveon, if you must know.) .... I always win. It is boring, but it is the way of things. They say in a few hundred years, I can retire. When I do.... I want to open a gaming cafe in Heaven. I hope those I've played will come back. I can't wait to lose to them then.
