 Living is easier if you don't think of you fellows as equals but as, let's call it, people. For me, people have always been the same: There exist righteous ones but just as many who can be described as malicious, some are loving, some cold-hearted, completely stern and so on. I think I have made my point. Whenever I interacted with somebody, I was convinced that all their actions are purely based on with what traits they are born with. They had no choice, forced by nature and unable to change. However, I did not see myself as an exception, I had got things straightened out with myself and the way I saw the world. Until now. Five minutes ago, everything has been fine but when I gazed at my mother's crying eyes, I realised I had not hurt just a person, I had hurt another human being. Everything happened so fast, I still can not wrap my mind about what has happened. It was just a usual fight, caused by my quick-tempered haste, about the most mundane thing in the world: loading the dishwasher. I lashed out at her, venting my frustration at the wrong person. Now, for the first time, I look beyond my set ways and the for granted taken images I had of people. Her body is trembling uncontrollably, she can not utter a single sound, stunned by my actions. Tears are rolling down her wrinkled face, wetting her rosy cheeks. Everybody around me, especially I, makes mistakes all the time, not because we are stuck with the way we are born, but because nobody is infallible. Each of us is only trying to figure life out, how to live with other people together, how to survive the strain of adulthood. Every day is a completely new challenge and trying to master it means making mistakes. How could I have been so blinded my whole life?
