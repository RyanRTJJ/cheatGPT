 Sinking behind the mountain the sun goes and as it dies it emits a cry and the trees and stream and air ignite and the world is burnt. My hand floats to my head and I can see only a little and a squirrel hops past my fingers and out of sight and the crackling leaves beneath its feet fill the forest up to its brim with sound I'm walking slowly and sometimes sticky plants cling to me and the wind whispers at me and it scares me, it sounds like it wants me to go away but I love this place so much and I just can't go home until mom calls for me A thump comes from over there and my hand falls down and since the sun is leaving I can see better and in a little ditch far away dirt flies up and I hear hard breathing mix with the wind A deer or some big animal is probably down there and I have to look at it, Andrew won't believe me because he thinks my woods are lame and don't have any cool animals in them but he's wrong so I go towards the dirt even though the wind picks up and I'm honestly a little more scared
