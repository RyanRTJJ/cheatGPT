 Dearest whomever is left, I don't know when in my "life" you'll be reading this or what the circumstances have been. I am sure of how I feel, always have, and always would have. Since you're reading this Its certain that I have finally been able to take control and I'm no longer with you. It wasn't out of sadness or depression. It wasn't because you all weren't fantastic. I enjoyed every moment of you. What's a million sunrises without a final sunset? Don't be sad for me and don't take it out on yourselves. I loved every moment even the bad parts because they gave way to better times. I waited until Tony went because that responsibility was mine to shoulder. No one else needed to carry that weight. Some of you may have noticed me acting odd lately. Going out of my way to fix things with people, pay my debts. Hand out apologies to some and offer forgiveness to others. I finished shows and stopped starting new ones. I've run my gas tank dry and donated any funds I may have had left however meager they may have been. When you guys talk about me, don't talk about the darkness" in my life. Don't discuss how I went. Share the lessons we learned together. The fun we had and the adventures we went on. Know I killed my self as an Atheist so I don't expect anything. I went smiling because I finally had the freedom to do what I wanted and this is It. I wanted control. ALWAYS have. I hope that P outlived me. I hope she was happy in life and know that my final thoughts where of her. I never forgot the promise I made. Make sure she knows that. Fuck you everybody goodnight! Signed A happy man who died in love P.s. You know what to do with my hdds, ssds and endless crates of composition books........no peaking.
