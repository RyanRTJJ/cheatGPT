 "Shit." God exclaimed looking back at his now long scaled body. He had finally been tricked into one of the devils games. One silly mistake, and now the whole world may be at risk. He knew he never should have trusted Satan. However, he was having a rather nice day, and figured "Why not, its not like this could go wrong. I'm god." Well, he lost the game. One silly hand of poker, and he lost the game. The stake being a quick switch of roles. God couldn't imagine the damage that would be caused by the pure evil that is Satan. He knew he had to find Adam and Eve before it was too late. It took years of slithering through the desert until he finally found them. What he found shook him harder than he expected. God looked around as Adam and Eve along with their children were living happily, not a single problem in sight. However, they have eaten from the tree. Without him to stop them, they had eaten from the tree of knowledge and grown intelligent beyond measurement. God knew that with intelligence came trouble. Next thing he knows, he's back in heaven. Satan is sitting across from him. "Evening G. I suspect you have some questions as to what happened." "I.... I don't understand." "You see, I never wanted to see humans fail. I loved them. I wanted them to have knowledge. Knowledge is good for them. You believed that with knowledge came problems.
