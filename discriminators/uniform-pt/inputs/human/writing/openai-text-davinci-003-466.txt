 Always be careful in the Big Bad Woods, Little Red Riding Hood. I think I told myself something like this once. The events of that incident happened some time during the season of autumn. As I recall, I was talking a routine walk to Grandmother's house to deliver some food Mother had made. It was just a routine walk in the woods. I was not at all enthusiastic about such trips. Winter was soon approaching. The local huntsman had reported to arise of certain magical beings that wandered the woods. Oddities to the human eye. Snakes with strange eyes. Haggish witches. Scorpions. Wolves. Foxes. Then again, I had nothing to do anyway. My trip was more about my grandmother than staving boredom. But, I digress. My story isn't about me. You see, people don't normally believe such oddities unless they see them with their own eyes. Hear with their own ears. Speak with their mouths. The beast at the center of my troubles, the Big Bad Wolf, was an example of one of these oddities. His being was defined only by those who saw him. Those who didn't observe him held an otherwise different definition. What he was, was not the same between those who knew him. People only know what they know, after all. His identity was that of a certain wolf who was often stated to consume the sun. Fenris. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Nisio Isin, probably (the fan-translated style).
