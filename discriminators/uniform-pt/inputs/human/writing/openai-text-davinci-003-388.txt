 Three years, that's how long I waited to use this power for her. Whenever I was dating a girl I would create the safe point right before I asked her to the first date. That way if things went badly, I could just erase it from my history. It was inconvenient at times, especially when I was in school, but the total lack of baggage was more than worth it. I could date coworkers, best friend's sisters (all of them), and even teachers once I was over eighteen. Things didn't go well, I just reloaded my safe file and erased the relationship. There was also a second benefit. Once I married ‘ The One ’, I could go back to the start of our relationship and get rid of all the fights. I would know all of our similarities and our differences. I would know the things she was sensitive about, and the things she wasn't. It would make our connection so much deeper, now that I knew exactly how to forge that connection. Not to mention I get to fall in love with the woman of my dreams *twice*. How many people get to do that? I'm sitting at the table in Panera where Lucy and I first met. Any second now she would walk through that door, and the beautiful part was I already knew what to say. She steps through the door, fiery hair streaming behind her, and without a moment's hesitation I stride over to her. “ Excuse me, do you have a band aid? ” I ask her. “ No I don't. I'm sorry. ” She says. “ That's a shame, because I just scraped my knee falling for you. ” I say, grinning madly. She face palms. “ Oh my gosh, I can't believe you said that! ”
