 You are the One Today is a special day, today is your Birthday. After twenty five years of trials and testing, you have proven yourself over all your predecessors. Where countless other have faltered and perished, you have survived. Weather it was distant cold ice worlds, exotic deadly jungles or searing sand dune deserts. You've overcome suicide missions and turned undesirables into highly proficient soldiers. Today is the day you will learn that you're the product of all of humanities scientific endeavors and dreams. You and your predecessors weren't created out of scientific curiosity, but rather an act of desperation. Throughout our history, great warriors would arise to lead armies, Hannibal, Alexander the Great, Caesar, Scipio, Patton, and Rommel. But in our Darkest hours we could not wait for one to appear, so we created our own. We toyed with the work of the gods to create life, to create the perfect soldier. Through genetic modification we've created a subject that was Physically and mentally enhanced. Each subject would be engraved with number, and put through deadly series of challenges. Through trial and error, each subject would perish and the information from their experiences and deaths would prove the chances of the next. Fifteen thousand, two hundred and five subjects have died in some form or another to lead to the creation of you, the One. Your brothers and sisters'deaths will not be in vain, because your the reason they were created. We may have fled in the Great Exodus centuries ago, but you are destined to lead us back to our home, back to earth. With your guidance, we will expel the invaders
