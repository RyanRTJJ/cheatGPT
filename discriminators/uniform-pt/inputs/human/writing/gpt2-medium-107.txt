 "It looks like our invasion plan was incredibly misguided", the first counselor opens the discussion. "The weapons we brought have zero effect on the humans. Apparently, they can not see the color spectrum our beams utilize." "Some of the generals are asking for complete withdrawal", the second counselor follows. The commander rubs his chin. This situation was unforeseen and things only haven't gone worse because the human can't see their attackers either to even realize there's an invasion taking place.

Though we still can not explain how something like that can be even remotely possible." "What is it then? That can cause so much
