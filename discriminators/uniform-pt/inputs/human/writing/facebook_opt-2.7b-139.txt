 Disclaimer: I am only 15 so be nice. However, I would like some tips as I am a noob. I wrote this similar to Zamyatin's book We and George Orwell's 1984. It is summer time, I watch the birds fly by, the trees dance in the air and feel the wind across my rugged face. Sitting on my porch admiring nature, I try to imagine what it might feel like to be free. The birds are free as well as the bees, but why not man? “ The world is not what it used to be ” Says my friend number three, “ Our allegiance to the state is what will advance humanity! ” three says again. After seeing the sunset, I go into my house. All the houses of Oberon, the city I live in, are banded with a huge golden plaque that says FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. WAR IS PEACE. The city of Oberon is an oppressive dictatorship, no one goes by names, their is no religion, no values, only our allegiance to the state. Dusting the huge golden plaque I notice the city newspaper, The Oberon Chronicle sitting solemnly on my desk. It is the only source of information I have about the outside world. Glancing at it I see enormous words saying “ Capitalism and the Success of Western nations ”. Capitalism, a political system so very different than my own country. It is saddening to find how even through the political systems we create, we can never seem to solve the vast extremes between the rich and the poor. Looking at the newspaper, I realize what Three said to me. Our government wether Capitalist or not, is corrupt. No candidate seems to be telling the truth and
