 She held his hands on the beach. No suit for him, no big dress for her. The sunset, the water, their best friends as best man and maid of honor and a priest. Not that they were religious, just nostalgic, traditionalist. The words were said, the tears cried (his) and then the priest and friends had gone. They sat together and he held his new bride close. **A flash of pain! White walls** Back on the beach. She looked over her shoulder. "Another headache?" He covered, "It'll pass." "We should go inside, the sunshine, the heat, they're all triggers." "I wouldn't trade this moment for anything" he said. "It's why I had to be strong. The medication made me a zombie, trapped in my own skull. Sure no headaches, but then..." With a laugh he continued. "Not much of a head." She settled back into his arms, mollified for a moment, but still tense. "Do you ever worry you'll back slide?" **Another flash, a doctor, shining a light into his eyes. ** A memory, nothing more. With a resigned tone, "All the time. But I need to be clear to be here. To be with you." A worried tone permeated her voice, "Do you worry that I'm not real?" He paused, looked to the sunrise.
