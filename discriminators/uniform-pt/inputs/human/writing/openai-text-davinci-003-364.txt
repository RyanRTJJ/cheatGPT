 "I have just had, like, literally the worst day in the history of mankind. Like 300 % done!" I dropped my macbook air on the table and sat down. I'm, like, super sure of this. Super duper sure, so I pulled up my iPhone 7 plus and loaded up the Liars app, so they could tell I was telling the truth. "Oh no, Kaitlyn, tell me all about it, don't you even worry." My boyfriend, Mark, said. He's a little dumb at times, but kinda cute so I kept him. "So, like, I was about to go outside, and there was, like, water, in my uggs. I don't know how it got there, it didn't even rain yesterday!" I paused, and my phone flashed green for truth. "So I had to wear my riding boots. In this weather. And then, when I went to my car, a stupid bird had pooped right on the windshield and I had to look at it the whole time here." "That does sound like the start to a terrible day." Mark said, stroking my hair. "What happened next?" "What? No, nothing happened next. Then I drove to Starbucks and met up with you." We both stared at my phone. It stayed green-truth. "Literally, the worst day in the history of mankind." I rolled my eyes. Green-truth. Mark took a very deep sigh, like he does sometimes (I told you he's a little dumb sometimes) and looked me right in the eyes. "I'm breaking up with you." I looked at the phone. Green-truth.
