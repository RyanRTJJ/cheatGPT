 I heard the voice clear as day. Imaginary friend? That's insane. Gunshots rang off the barrels nearby and I rolled away from them, toward a barrier of cover. A bullet rang off the wall and another hit near my head. The port was full of gunfire. I reached the cover and stood, firing a burst from my FAL. The 7.62 rounds ripped through a soldier, and I never saw the other coming up on me. "Watch out to your left!" the same odd voice called. I looked to the left and saw a soldier whipping back and forth through cover to flank me. I pulled the pin on a hand grenade and tossed it into his vicinity, hearing it explode and the man's scream. Odd, I was never a good hand at throwing. My comrades were dead. I moved forward, nervous and tense. I reached the warehouse and peered in, not before hearing the voice, "You've got this. Your son is proud of you." I turned and raised my rifle, spotting an enemy soldier on the catwalk and firing a burst, taking him down. To my left there was a rush of footsteps as a soldier with a combat knife hopped up and raised his knife. He brought it down and I closed my eyes, ready for the agony. Suddenly, the force of a rubber blade hit my shoulder. In my confusion, I shoved him off of me and fired into him. Overseas, little Tony looked in confusion at the combat knife in his hand. Wow, it was so cool! But hadn't he just been playing army with his friends using his toy knife?
