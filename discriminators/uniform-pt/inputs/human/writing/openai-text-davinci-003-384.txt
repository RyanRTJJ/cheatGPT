 As I sat next to the Chairman of the House, waiting for the President to finish his speech, I went over my thoughts. I needed a way to deliver the message in a short, smooth, and slightly comedic way. This was a time of joy, not one of lawyer-speak. It's rare that I, as the Secretary of Defense, get to make jokes or even act like a real human being. I could, after all, say something politically incorrect that would ruin my job. The Chairman got up and made his speech. More of the same political talk. No soul, no humanity in it. It's considered political suicide to act like a real person. I couldn't stand it. What should I say? I play a key role in this press conference. I'm the one that's going to tell the world what happened. Hours before, we got word from the leadership of the political coup. The Chairman finished his speech. Now it was my turn to get up. I slowly walked to the podium. I adjusted my tie. I couldn't remember any of my speech. It was a soulless speech, but of course I was going to add some of my own soul to it.
