 He pulled the trigger. *Click* The chamber was empty but my unit didn't know that. They opened fire shredding the protestor to bits with their high powered military ammunition. The fire continued through his already lifeless body into the crowd behind him. I can't stop it. No one can stop it now. It was supposed to be a peaceful protest. Even our unit leaders said so, but our unit was created to patrol these marches in order to "Maintain order". People cried foul.... but they always cried foul. We were just doing our job. *I* was just doing my job. I had only been on the force a short while. I hadn't even drawn my gun on a perp before. What was this guy thinking. What was going through his mind. Something about a reset. About explaining something. What was wrong with him. This wasn't the Matrix for God's Sake. The spray of blood snapped me out of my revery. The form in front of me was no longer a human. It was meat that had been put through a grinder. Chaos flowed behind it. The stench of death as my unit ripped into the marchers. Signs proclaiming "More Money to Teach, Less Money to Kill" hit the ground. Screams filled my mind. And still I stood there frozen. Could I let this happen? He was clearly mad. Had he meant for this to happen? But..... Why had we been here? They were only teachers.... parents.... children. Did we need riot police to protect against that? Maybe we needed a reset.
