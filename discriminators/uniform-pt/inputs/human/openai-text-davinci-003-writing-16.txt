 Have you ever heard of the “ Oh My God Particle? ” Well, for the non-total space nerds in the crowd, the Oh My God Particle was a proton, we think, that hit the earth in 1991 travelling at about 0.999 999 999 999 999 999 999 9951c; or about 671 million miles an hour. A single proton hit earth traveling at a smidge under the speed of light with the same force as a baseball thrown at about sixty miles an hour. Why do I bring this up? Well because, near as we can tell, that's what happened this time, only a little bigger. One moment I'm out on the Zvezda Module inspecting a micrometeorite impact. The next moment, the Earth is on fire. I'm not being figurative either. The Earth was on. Fire. Whatever the hell it was must have come from perpendicular to our orbit and only missed the ISS by a few hundred miles or so because I was looking almost straight down into an ever expanding ring of fire when it hit. One second you're looking down at the Saharan desert; the next, the entirety of Africa is exposed down to the mantle and you're looking at a literal sea of magma. We did the math, there wasn't much left to do beside the math. There was nothing left. The meteorite was maybe 5 cubic meters, but moving at about ninety percent the speed of light, it hit with 2.43 septillion joules. That's a number so large I can't even draw an analogy. It was so powerful that it
